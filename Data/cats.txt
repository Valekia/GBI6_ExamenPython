AB  - Introduction: Although evidence-based treatments for posttraumatic stressdisorder (PTSD) in adolescents and young adults exist, affected youth do not havesufficient access to these treatments due to structural and attitudinal barriers.Internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) can help fill this healthcaregap, but such programmes have not yet been sufficiently evaluated in youth withPTSD. Aim: This study aims to investigate the feasibility of an IMI for youthwith PTSD in a one-arm, non-randomised, prospective proof-of-concept feasibility study. Methods: We aim to recruit 32 youth between 15 and 21 years old withclinically relevant posttraumatic stress symptoms (CATS >/= 21), who will receiveaccess to the IMI. The IMI consists of nine sessions involving psychoeducation,emotion regulation and coping skills, written-based imaginal exposure, cognitive restructuring and relapse prevention. Participants will be guided by an eCoach,who provides weekly semi-standardised written feedback on completed sessions and adherence reminders. We will use a formal feasibility framework to assessdifferent dimensions of feasibility: (1) recruitment capability and resultingsample characteristics, (2) data collection procedures and outcome measures, (3) acceptability of the IMI and study procedures, (4) resources and ability tomanage and implement the study and IMI and (5) participants' responses to the IMIin terms of symptom severity and satisfaction. Additionally, potential negativeeffects related to the intervention will be assessed. Assessments take placepre-, mid- and post-intervention and at follow-up, including semi-structuredclinical telephone interviews for PTSD diagnostics at pre- and post-intervention assessment. Qualitative interviews will be conducted to investigate the youthperspectives on the IMI. Discussion: This study aims to determine the feasibilityof a guided IMI for youth with PTSD to adapt the IMI as closely as possible toyouth needs and to inform the design, procedure and safety management of alarge-scale efficacy RCT. Trial registration: German Clinical Trials Registeridentifier: DRKS00023341. HIGHLIGHTS: Evidence-based care for adolescents aftertrauma is not widely available.* This study evaluates the feasibility of a guidedtrauma-focused Internet intervention as a time- and location-independentlow-threshold treatment option for adolescents and young adults withposttraumatic stress disorder.

TI  - Medium chain fatty acid esters are effective even in azole resistant Malasseziapachydermatis.
LID - 10.1111/myc.13512 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malassezia (M.) pachydermatis as a frequent reason for dermatologicalconsultation in dogs and cats was recently shown to be lipid-dependent, too.Lipolytic activity is a prerequisite for activating antimicrobial effectivity of fatty acid esters. OBJECTIVES: It was therefore of interest whether it ispossible to induce this mechanism in M. pachydermatis and to identify possibledifferences between minimal and strong lipid-dependent strains. METHODS: In anagar dilution test, the minimal inhibitory concentrations of six fatty acidesters were determined for seventeen M. pachydermatis strains. GC analysis ofparent compounds and liberated fatty acids was used to quantify ester cleavage.RESULTS: Hydrolysis was observed in all test strains in a homogenous manner butwas dependent on the chemical structure. Lowest MICs (500ppm after 14 days ofincubation) were obtained applying glyceryl monocaprylate and 3-hydroxylpropylcaprylate, while the corresponding esters of undecylenic acid showed nearly twicethe value. As shown by GC analysis with the reference strains CBS 1879 and CBS1892 and 3-hydroxypropyl caprylate, hydrolysis and caprylic acid formation startsimmediately and was dependent on yeast density. Furthermore, nine azole resistantstrains isolated from dogs with treatment failures showed MIC values comparableto the other strains and no resistance to monohydric fatty acid esters.CONCLUSIONS: Medium chain fatty acid esters may represent a new therapeuticoption for veterinary use even in azole-resistant strains. The in vivoverification in M. pachydermatis associated dermatitis in dogs and cats will bethe next step for the successful development of new therapeutics.

TI  - A pilot study: Can calcaneus radiographic image be used to determine sex andbreed in cats?
LID - 10.1002/vms3.899 [doi]
AB  - This study examined whether radiographic images measurements of the calcaneus in cats are determinative of sex and breed. For this purpose, radiographic images of70 cats (37 male and 33 females) of different ages (from one to 18 years) anddifferent breeds (41 mix-breed, 18 Scottish Fold and 11 British Shorthair cats)without orthopaedic problems were used. Right tarsal joint radiographs of theseorthopaedically healthy cats were taken. Four linear measurements and two anglevalues of the calcaneus were obtained from the radiographic images. The MANOVAresult showed that the most determining factor between the three groups was thegreatest width (p value = 0.001). Calcaneal body length, calcaneal greatestlength and calcaneal shortest depth were higher in mix-breed cats. Calcanealtuber length was higher in Scottish Fold cats. The only statistically significantdifference between Scottish Fold and British Shorthair was in the calcaneal tuberlength (p value = 0.04). In the comparison made between the sexes regardless ofspecies, the linear measurements in males were higher than in females. It wasdetermined that these parameters are statistically significant in terms of sexdifferentiation in cats. Dorsal and plantar calcaneal angles are not sexdeterminants in cats. The effect of age on other measurements was analysed bycorrelation test. However, the effect of age on the measurements was notstatistically significant. Mix-breed cats were examined in four groups according to their colour (grey, black-white, yellow, tri-colour). No statisticallysignificant difference was found between calcaneal measurements of cats withdifferent skin colour genotypes. In this study, calcaneus measurements were both determinative between breeds and sexes in cats.

AB  - This paper reports a presumptive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in a cat. A cat with respiratory disease living with threeindividuals with coronavirus disease 2019 showed bilateral ground-glass opacitiesin the lung on X-ray and computed tomography. The clinical swabs were negativefor SARS-CoV-2 RNA, but the serum was positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.Interstitial pneumonia and prominent type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia were noted on histopathology. Respiratory tissues were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen, but the cat was positive for feline parvovirus DNA. In conclusion, therespiratory disease and associated pathology in this cat could have been due toexposure to SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Development and validation of an owner-assessed Visual Analog Scale for felinepruritus severity scoring (VAScat).
LID - 10.1111/vde.13103 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Assessment of the severity of pruritus is difficult in cats, because they manifest discomfort by increased licking, increased scratching or both.HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to develop and validate afeline-specific pruritus scale (VAScat). METHODS: The scale was designed as adouble Visual Analog Scale (VAS), one VAS for licking and one for scratching,with severity and behavioural descriptors. The highest score (VAS-max) on either VAS was taken as the pruritus score for each cat. Owners of 153 cats with skindiseases and of 108 healthy cats scored their pet's pruritus using the VAScat.Ninety-six of 153 cats with skin diseases also were re-evaluated after four toeight weeks of treatment. RESULTS: Pearson's correlation value betweenVAS-licking and VAS-scratching scores was r = 0.26 (p < 0.01), and Cronbach'salpha was 0.41. Both indexes indicated that the two scales measure differentmanifestations of pruritus and supported the use of a dual assessing system.Comparison with a numerical pruritus severity scale (0, absent; 1, mild; 2,moderate; 3, severe) suggested that VAS-licking and VAS-scratching scales takenalone are unsuitable for measuring absent to mild pruritus (grades 0-1), whileVAS-max is (p = 0.001). VAS-licking, VAS-scratching and VAS-max all were suitableto assess higher levels of pruritus (grades 2-3, p < 0.01). The VAScat was ableto measure pruritus improvement following therapy, as post-treatment scores were significantly decreased compared to pre-treatment ones (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The VAScat proved to be a useful tool to assess pruritusin cats and for monitoring the response to treatment for pruritus.

AB  - Objective: To calculate prescribed daily doses (PDDs) for selected antimicrobialsand evaluate application of defined daily doses (DDDs) using an antimicrobialpurchasing dataset. Animals: Data from dogs and cats treated for bacterialcystitis at a veterinary practice network were evaluated. Procedure: A datasetcontaining antimicrobial prescriptions for dogs and cats diagnosed with bacterialcystitis was evaluated. Median dose and frequency and median weight of treatedanimals were used to calculate PDDs. To account for differences in use betweendogs and cats, an adjusted DDD was calculated based on adjustment forproportional use in dogs versus cats. Results: PDDs for dogs and cats weredetermined and adjusted DDDs were calculated and applied to an antimicrobialpurchasing dataset from 886 veterinary clinics, demonstrating the differencebetween mass-based and DDD data. Conclusions: DDDs can be estimated usingprescription datasets, accounting for differences in weights (between and within species) and relative use between dogs and cats. These can be applied to broader (sales, purchase) datasets to provide a more detailed understanding of howantimicrobials are used. Clinical relevance: DDDs could be a useful measure forassessing mass-based antimicrobial use datasets as part of antimicrobialstewardship surveillance efforts.

AB  - Current management practices of pyometra in the private practice setting are not well documented. The goal of this study was to understand pyometra management in the private practice setting, and the current relationship private practices havewith high quality, high volume, spay-neuter (HQHVSN) clinics regarding referralfor pyometra surgery. An anonymous electronic survey was piloted and distributed using SurveyMonkey via email, social media, and the Independent VeterinaryPractitioners Association targeting veterinarians who see companion animals. Atotal of 153 responses were received from June-July 2021, with respondentsdistributed throughout the United States. Practices performed a median of 10 spayand neuters per week, with the median spay cost being $350 (IQR 250-500) for dogsand $250 (IQR 180-350) for cats. The median cost of a pyometra surgery was $1000 (IQR 700-1500) for dogs and $750 (IQR 450-1000) for cats. All practices treatedpyometra at least sometimes, despite the disruption (major 19%, moderate 47%,mild 29%, none 5%) to their day. All pyometra presentations were accepted fortreatment at least sometimes: BAR/QAR (98%), depressed or non-ambulatory (88%),and obtunded or lateral (62%) with mean estimated survival of 96%, 74%, and 31%, respectively. The majority (56%) of clients were reported to sometimes havetrouble paying for all recommended services, while it was less often reportedthat clients often (31%) or rarely (13%) had trouble. Private practices willingto refer only did so always 20% of the time and sometimes 36% of the time.Private practices will do what they can to treat most pyometras that present attheir practice within a timely manner before referring elsewhere. There iscurrently inconsistent utilization of HQHVSN clinics as a potential referralresource due to location or appointment availability.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic affected not only the physical and emotional health ofhuman beings but also cats. Restrictions put into effect during the pandemicresulted in changes in the daily routine of pet cats and the number of new petowners. The current study aimed to evaluate the diseases induced by stress incats, such as gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, and urinary tract diseases. Tothis end, the study evaluated the pre-pandemic (n: 52) (March 2019-Feb 2020) and pandemic (n: 95) (March 2020-March 2021) diagnosis data of cats (n: 147) withgastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, and urinary system diseases admitted to theInternal Medicine Department of Hatay Mustafa Kemal University Veterinary Health,Practice and Research Center between March 2019 and March 2021. There was nostatistically significant difference between the sexes of the cats admitted tothe clinic in both periods. There was a significant change in cat breeds duringthe pandemic, except for the mixed-breed and Ankara breeds. The age (mean +/-SEM) of the cats admitted to the clinic was 30.14 +/- 4.24 months before thepandemic and 30.45 +/- 3.43 during the pandemic. Distributions ofgastrointestinal diseases in the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods weredetermined as 35.7% and 64.3%, respectively. During the pandemic, the number ofgastritis cases was lower than that in the pre-pandemic period, and the number ofgastroenteritis cases was higher than that in the pre-pandemic period. Except forgastrointestinal diseases (P<0.05), a statistical difference between the periods was not found. The changes, especially influencing the daily routine of cats and causing stress, seem to have had significant effects on the gastrointestinalhealth of domestic cats.

AB  - Little is known about the difference of myocardial gene transcription in youngand adult cats and how transcription is further modified in cats withhypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and with left atrial (LA) thrombus formation.We hypothesized that selected factors for coagulation, endothelial activation,inflammation, and remodelling are modified with age and are activated in thehearts of cats with HCM. Left atrial and ventricular (LV) samples from 12 catswith HCM (seven without (HCMwoAT] and five with LA thrombi [HCMwAT]), and sixyoung (YC) and six adult (AC) control cats without cardiac disease wereinvestigated for relative expression of the following genes using quantitativepolymerase chain reaction: von Willebrand factor, a disintegrin andmetalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif member 13, plateletactivating factor, E- and P-selectin, intercellular and vascular adhesionmolecules-1, ss2-integrin, vascular endothelial growth factor, interleukin-6(IL-6), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), heat shock protein-70, andmyocyte-specific enhancer factor 2C. Significant differences in gene activationwere found between YC and AC, and YC and cats with HCM. Compared to AC, MCP-1 andIL-6 were significantly higher in cats with HCM. The presence of an LA thrombuswas associated with higher IL-6 expression. These results illustrate therelevance of age and/or lifestyle on gene expression in the feline heart. Thegene transcription pattern found in AC hearts might predispose cats to theircharacteristic cardiac remodelling processes and thrombus formation if diseaseoccurs. It further supports the involvement of inflammation, but not coagulation and endothelial activation, in HCM.

AB  - Significant improvement in thiamin retention of canned cat food has not beenachieved by altering processing conditions. Some ingredients, such as yeasts, maysupply thiamin able to withstand thermal processing. Therefore, the studyobjective was to evaluate yeast ingredients as thiamin sources for canned catfood. Six yeast ingredients were screened for thiamin content, and values ranged from 9.9-4,283.8 mg/kg dry matter basis (DMB). Treatments for thermal processing were arranged as a 2x4 factorial with 2 levels of vitamin premix (with orwithout) and 4 yeast ingredients (NY = none and LBV, BY, or EA from theingredient screening). Replicates (n = 3) were processed in a horizontal stillretort to an average lethality of 79.23 minutes. Thiamin degradation was analyzedas a mixed model with pre-retort thiamin content as a covariate and productionday as a random effect. Main effects of vitamin premix and yeast and theirinteraction were significant at P-values less than 0.05. The Fisher's LSD posthoc comparison test was used to separate means. On average, experimental formulasretained 33.75% thiamin. The main effect of vitamin premix (average -42.9 mg/kgDMB) was not significant (P > 0.05). Thiamin degradation between NY (-31.3 mg/kg DMB) and BY (-33.8 mg/kg DMB) was similar (P > 0.05) whereas EA (-40.5 mg/kg DMB)and LBV (-55.6 mg/kg DMB) lost more (P < 0.05) thiamin than NY. The experimental formula of EA with vitamin premix (-70.3 mg/kg DMB) lost more (P < 0.05) thiamin than no yeast, BY, or EA without vitamin premix (average -17.4 mg/kg DMB) and allothers (average -57.3 mg/kg DMB) were intermediate (P > 0.05). In summary,thiamin from yeast ingredients didn't exhibit better thermal stability thanthiamin mononitrate. However, those ingredients with similar degradation levelsor uniquely high thiamin levels may provide added value.

TI  - A model to determine at-home restrictions for cats after treatment ofhyperthyroidism with radioiodine.
LID - 10.1111/jsap.13533 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Felinehyperthyroidism is the most common endocrine disease of oldercats and radioiodine is considered to be the gold standard treatment. Isolationperiods following treatment vary depending on both individual treatmentfacilities and the relevant legislation of the country; therefore, there is norecognised standardised protocol defining the length of isolation. This workdescribes how our institution validated that its owner restrictions met doseconstraints by using a model of iodine retention to calculate the requiredduration and nature of owner restrictions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The retainedradioactivity of cats at the point of discharge was used to simulate theradiation dose to owners in the 90 days following release. The model created was used to calculate the minimum duration of isolation for a range of administeredactivities and owner restrictions. RESULTS: Using the model, it was found thatwhen injected with the maximum dose used, 222 MBq radioiodine, it was possible torelease cats after 14 days of isolation and keep owner doses below 0.30 mSv(whole-body effective dose constraint for a single radiation source) with somerestrictions. It was possible to release after 23 days with no restrictions.CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The present study provides clinicians with a consistentand verified method in which they can calculate the isolation periods forradioiodine-treated cats.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System(PROMIS(R)) has been recommended for computerized adaptive testing (CAT) ofhealth-related quality of life (HRQOL). This study compared the content, validityand reliability of seven PROMIS CATs to the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey(SF-12) in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: AdultCKD patients with an eGFR < 30 ml/min.1.73m2 not receiving dialysis treatmentcompleted seven PROMIS CATs (assessing physical function, pain interference,fatigue, sleep disturbance, anxiety, depression, and ability to participate insocial roles and activities), the SF-12 and, additionally, the PROMIS PainIntensity single item and Dialysis Symptom Index (DSI) at inclusion and 2-weeks. A content comparison was performed between PROMIS CATs and SF-12. Constructvalidity of PROMIS CATs was assessed using Pearson's correlations. Test-retestreliability of all patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) was assessed bycalculating the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and minimal detectable change (MDC). RESULTS: In total, 207 patients participated in the study. A medianof 45 items (10 minutes) was completed for PROMIS CATs. All PROMIS CATs showedevidence for sufficient construct validity. PROMIS CATs, most SF-12 domains andsummary scores, and DSI showed sufficient test-retest reliability (ICC >/= 0.70).PROMIS CATs had a lower MDC compared to the SF-12 (5.7-7.4 compared to 11.2-21.7 across domains, respectively). CONCLUSION: PROMIS CATs showed sufficientconstruct validity and test-retest reliability in patients with advanced CKD.PROMIS CATs required more items but showed better reliability than the SF-12.Future research is needed to investigate the feasibility of PROMIS CATs forroutine nephrology care.

AB  - Wildfires pose a major health risk for humans, wildlife, and domestic animals. Wepreviously discovered pathophysiologic parallels between domestic cats withnaturally occurring smoke inhalation and thermal burn injuries and human beingswith similar injuries; these were characterized by transient myocardialthickening, cardiac troponin I elevation and formation of intracardiacthrombosis. While the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, results from murinemodels suggest that platelet priming and activation may contribute to a globalhypercoagulable state and thrombosis. Herein, we evaluated and compared thedegree of platelet activation, platelet response to physiologic agonists andlevels of platelet-derived microvesicles (PDMV) in 29 cats with naturallyoccurring wildfire thermal injuries (WF), 21 clinically healthy cats withsubclinical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and 11 healthy cats without HCM(CC). We also quantified and compared circulating PDMVs in WF cats to CC cats. Inaddition, we examined the association between thrombotic events, severity of burninjuries, myocardial changes, and the degree of platelet activation in catsexposed to wildfires. Flow cytometric detection of platelet surface P-selectinexpression showed that WF cats had increased platelet response to adenosinediphosphate (ADP) and thrombin compared to the two control groups indicating the presence of primed platelets in circulation. In addition, cats in the WF grouphad increased circulating levels of PDMV, characterized by increasedphosphatidylserine on the external leaflet. Cats in the WF group with documented intracardiac thrombosis had elevated platelet activation and platelet priming in the presence of ADP. While high dose arachidonic acid (AA) mostly resulted inplatelet inhibition, persistent response to AA was noted among cats in the WFgroup with intracardiac thrombosis. Univariate and multiple logistic regressionanalyses demonstrated that increased platelet response to AA was independentlyassociated with thrombotic events. This is the first study reporting thesignificant association between platelet priming and intracardiac thrombosis indomestic cats with naturally occurring wildfire-related injuries and smokeinhalation. Further studies are required to delineate additional mechanismsbetween inflammation and thrombosis, especially regarding platelet primers andthe cyclooxygenase pathway. One Sentence Summary: Platelet activation andshedding of platelet-derived microvesicles due to platelet priming is presentfollowing naturally occurring wildfire smoke exposure and thermal burn injuriesin a population of domestic cats.

TI  - Dealing With Stress in Cats: What Is New About the Olfactory Strategy?
PG  - 928943
LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.928943 [doi]
AB  - Domestic cats are descended from solitary wild species and rely heavily on theolfaction system and chemical signals for daily activities. Cats kept ascompanion animals may experience stress due to a lack of predictability in their physical or social environment. The olfactory system is intimately connected tothe brain regions controlling stress response, thus providing uniqueopportunities for olfactory strategies to modify stress and related behavioralproblems in cats. However, the olfactory intervention of stress in cats has been mainly focused on several analog chemical signals and studies often provideinconsistent and non-replicable results. Supportive evidence in the literaturefor the potentially effective olfactory stimuli (e.g., cheek and mammary glandsecretions, and plant attractants) in treating stress in cats was reviewed.Limitations with some of the work and critical considerations from studies withnatural or negative results were discussed as well. Current findings sometimesconstitute weak evidence of a reproducible effect of cat odor therapy for stress.The welfare application of an olfactory stimulus in stress alleviation requires abetter understanding of its biological function in cats and the mechanisms atplay, which may be achieved in future studies through methodological improvement (e.g., experiment pre-registration and appropriate control setting) and in-depth investigation with modern techniques that integrate multisource data.Contributions from individual and environmental differences should be considered for the stress response of a single cat and its sensitivity to olfactorymanipulation. Olfactory strategies customized for specific contexts andindividual cats can be more effective in improving the welfare of cats in variousstressful conditions.

PG  - 100140
LID - 10.1016/j.crmicr.2022.100140 [doi]
AB  - Sporotrichosis is a subcutaneous mycosis caused by thermodimorphic fungi of thegenus Sporothrix. The phenotypic and genotypic differences of the isolates withinthe genus Sporothrix have been associated with their geographic distribution,virulence capacity, or clinical manifestation of sporotrichosis. Therefore, it iscrucial to identify the causative agent of sporotrichosis. However, there are fewcase reports and studies in animals compared to those in humans, despite thesubstantial increase in the number of cases of sporotrichosis by zoonotictransmission, especially in endemic areas. Considering the epidemiologicalimportance, taxonomic evolution and worldwide distribution of these fungi in the last decade, there is interest in identifying the species of the genus Sporothrixin different regions of the world. This study aimed to analyze the geographicdistribution of animal sporotrichosis in the world, caused by pathogenic species identified by use of molecular tools. This systematic review of articles from2007 to 2021 analyzed the geographic distribution of species that causesporotrichosis in cats, dogs and other animals. It demonstrated that the mostidentified species were S. brasiliensis, isolated from cats in Brazil and S.schenckii isolated from cats in Malaysia. We show the lack of studies in globalareas and reinforce the need to use molecular tools to identify and monitorpotential pathogens.

PG  - 1481-1485
LID - 10.36740/WLek202206110 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim: To develop a model for predicting asthma control status inschool-age children sensitized to cat allergens. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: The study included 302 children aged 6-17 years who were sensitized to cat allergens. The ALEX(2) test (Macro Array Diagnostics GmbH, Austria) wasused to analyze the sensitization profile in these children. After 12 months oftreatment, control of clinical asthma symptoms was achieved in 185 (61.26%)children. Single-factor logistic regression models were constructed to analyzethe probability of achieving asthma control in school-age children withsensitization to cat allergens. RESULTS: Results: It was found that asthmacontrol status depended on the FeNO dynamics after 3 months of treatment, thenumber of cat allergens to which sensitization was detected, and the duration of exposure to a domestic cat after sensitization tests, which were conducted toverify the allergic capacity to cat allergens. The investigation resulted in the creation of a mathematical model for predicting the probability of asthmacontrol, sensitivity 94.6 (95% CI 90.3 - 97.4) %, specificity - 81.2 (95% CI 72.9- 87.8) %, PPV = 88.8 (95% CI 84.5 - 92.1) %, NPV = 90.5 (95% CI 83.8 - 94.6) %. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: A model for predicting the probability of asthma controlwas created. The formula is used to calculate the patient's P. P > 0.44 allowspredicting the achievement of asthma control after 12 months of treatment.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of orally administered torasemide in healthy cats.
LID - 10.1111/jvim.16500 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In people and dogs, torasemide has higher bioavailability, longerhalf-life, and longer duration of action than equivalent doses of furosemide but data regarding pharmacological properties of torasemide in cats are limited.OBJECTIVE: To assess pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of torasemidein healthy cats, and to investigate the effects of a single administration oftorasemide on indicators of diuresis, plasma creatinine concentration, bloodpressure, electrolyte concentrations and markers of therenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). ANIMALS: Six clinically healthyadult European shorthair cats. METHODS: Randomized 4-period crossover design with3 groups and 4 treatments. Pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained using anoncompartmental analysis, and the clinically effective dose was assessed using aHill model. RESULTS: Mean absolute bioavailability was estimated at 88.1%. Meantotal body clearance was 3.64 mL/h/kg and mean terminal half-life was 12.9 hours.Urine output significantly increased after torasemide administration (P < .001). The urine sodium : potassium ratio (uNa : uK) paralleled and was statisticallycorrelated to urine output (P < .001). Administration of a single torasemide doseled to a significant dose-dependent increase in urine aldosterone : creatinineratio (uAldo : C; P < .001) and a transient decrease in plasma potassiumconcentration (P < .001) but did not affect blood pressure or plasma creatinineconcentration. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: A single torasemide doseleads to a significant increase in diuresis and renin-angiotensin-aldosteronesystem (RAAS) activation in healthy cats, with high absolute bioavailability, andwithout clinically relevant adverse effects. Pharmacokinetic parameters indicate that once daily dosing of 0.27 mg/kg may be appropriate in a clinical setting.

LID - 10.1002/jmv.28035 [doi]
AB  - We and other researchers have shown that companion animals (pet cats and dogs)are susceptible to natural SARS-CoV-2 infections. A recent report(1) indicatesthat pet cat can transmit SARS-CoV-2 to human via direct contact raises alegitimate concern that infected pets can pass the virus on to their human pet's owners. In this letter, we reviewed known cases of animal-to-human transmissions as well as human-to-animal transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 and assess the levels ofrisks in these scenarios.

AB  - Many cats show signs of fear and stress during veterinary examinations andprocedures, and environmental stimuli such as noise can contribute to theseresponses. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect ofbackground noise commonly heard in veterinary clinics (people talking, kenneldoors shutting, dogs barking) on behavioural and physiological responses incompanion cats. In Experiment 1, owned cats underwent a mock physical examinationin a veterinary clinic with (n=16) or without (n=16) a pre-recorded noise track. A second experiment was conducted to assess cat responses to noise outside ofhandling and a clinic environment. In Experiment 2, shelter cats were eitherexposed (n=15) or not exposed (n=15) to the same noise track while allowed freemovement in a small enclosure. Physiological and behavioural responses previouslyvalidated as negative responses in cats (e.g., indicative of fear, stress andaversion) were recorded, and outcome variables were compared between treatments. For both experiments, cats exposed to the noise track showed higher heart andrespiratory rates. Noise was not associated with behavioural changes during thephysical examination; however, cats who were freely moving showed morebehavioural signs of fear and/or stress during noise exposure compared to the no noise conditions. These results show that high levels of background noise elicit physiological stress responses in cats, while ceiling effects of the examination and exposure to the clinic environment likely prevented treatment-relatedbehavioral differences from being detected during the physical examination. It isrecommended that those working with cats in environments with high levels ofbackground noise limit cat exposure to these noises to reduce cat fear andstress.

TI  - Conservative nonsurgical treatment for cranial cruciate ligament disease can bean effective management strategy in cats based on validated owner-basedsubjective assessment in some cases.
PG  - 1-4
LID - 10.2460/javma.22.01.0009 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe long-term outcomes of cats managed medically for cranialcruciate ligament disease (CCLD) via a validated owner-based questionnaire.ANIMALS: 18 client-owned cats. PROCEDURES: Retrospective review of medicalrecords at 2 tertiary referral hospitals was conducted for records of catsdiagnosed with CCLD for which medical management was pursued. History, physicalexamination findings, and medical management strategies were recorded. Ownerfollow-up was obtained via phone call or an email correspondence interview using a 2-part questionnaire. Part 1 consisted of 5 multiple-choice questionsevaluating short-term outcomes following initiation of medical management. Part 2assessed long-term outcomes via the validated Feline Musculoskeletal PainIndex-short form metrology instrument. RESULTS: Mean follow-up time was 66.5 +/- 46.7 months (range, 7 to 154 months). Medical management included oralanalgesics, activity restriction, and joint supplements. Of the 18 cats, 13 (72%)were always able to bear weight or became weight bearing within a week following initiation of medical management, and 15 (83%) were reportedly clinically normal within 3 months of initiating medical management, with complete resolution oflameness occurring in less than 2 months in 12 of those cats. Long term, 17 ofthe 18 (94%) owners reported they felt that their cat had a good to excellentoutcome with medical management. The mean Feline Musculoskeletal Pain Index-shortform score of all cats was 0.29 +/- 0.53 (range, 0 to 2.13). CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Based on owner follow-up, conservative, nonsurgical management of CCLD can be an effective and appropriate management strategy for some cats; however, some may bebest treated with surgical stabilization.

PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.2460/javma.22.03.0109 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Assess US veterinarians' perceptions regarding vaccine concerns (theirown and owners') and the association between owners' vaccine concerns andCOVID-19 antivaccination sentiments. SAMPLE: Members of the VeterinaryInformation Network. PROCEDURES: An electronic survey distributed via theVeterinary Information Network data collection portal. RESULTS: 1,341 USveterinarians completed the survey. Top veterinarian concerns for vaccinating ahealthy adult dog were anaphylaxis, soreness at injection site, and lethargy; forcats, these concerns included vaccine-associated sarcoma, lethargy, and soreness at injection site. Veterinarians reported that the most common concerns mentionedby owners included that the pet does not go outside, that vaccinations areunnecessary, that vaccinations can lead to chronic or severe illness, and cost.Veterinarians reported an increased number of dog and cat owners reluctant about or resistant to the idea of rabies vaccines and core vaccines since the time thatCOVID-19 vaccines became widely available. There was an association betweenveterinarians' perceptions of local COVID-19 antivaccination sentiments and theincrease in the number of vaccine-resistant or -concerned clients. CLINICALRELEVANCE: There appears to be little overlap between veterinarians' primaryconcerns related to vaccinations and their perception of dog and cat owners'primary concerns. The fact that the number of resistant clients is positivelyassociated with the presence of veterinarians' perceptions of a local COVID-19antivaccination sentiment suggests that human antivaccination sentiments impactpet owners' views of companion animal vaccinations. A better understanding of thecognitive biases that impact owners' vaccine decisions can help veterinariansbetter communicate with vaccine-reluctant clients and increase vaccinationcompliance rates.

PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.2460/javma.22.03.0120 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To retrospectively evaluate preoperative historical, biochemical, andcardiovascular screening data for predictors of survival to discharge andlong-term survival in feline renal allograft recipients from 1 institution.ANIMALS: 166 cats that underwent renal transplantation at the University ofPennsylvania between 1998 and 2018. PROCEDURES: Medical records were reviewed forpreoperative historical information, biochemical data, and cardiac assessmentincluding auscultation findings, pre- and postoperative systolic blood pressuremeasurements, thoracic radiographic evaluation, and echocardiographicmeasurements. The need for hemodialysis, the number of surgical procedures,native kidney biopsy diagnosis and survival time was also recorded. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to generate survival plots and estimate median survival timeswith a 95% CI. Univariable and multivariable analysis were performed to determinevariables that were independently associated with survival to discharge andlong-term survival. RESULTS: The patient population primarily consisted of adult male DSH cats (70%) diagnosed with IRIS stage 4 CKD (66.3%). Abnormalitiesidentified on preoperative cardiac assessment, including hypertension, thepresence of a murmur, echocardiographic changes, and radiographic signs ofcongestive heart failure, were not associated with survival to discharge orlong-term survival. Age was the only single significant variable associated with survival, and the risk of death increased by 11% (95% CI, 6% to 17%) for every 1 year in patient age. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The presence of cardiac abnormalitiesidentified during the screening process of cats presenting for transplantationshould not immediately exclude a potential candidate for the procedure. Ownersconsidering transplantation should be educated on the impact of age on survivalfollowing surgery.

TI  - Should we be screening cats for cardiomyopathy? If so, how?
PG  - 1-5
LID - 10.2460/javma.22.06.0257 [doi]
AB  - Occult feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) can result in unexpected suddendeath or congestive heart failure (CHF) following routine interventions such asanesthesia, fluid administration, or, potentially, administration ofcorticosteroids. Consequently, clinicians would like to be able to screen at-riskcats to detect occult HCM and either avoid the risky intervention or attempt toreduce the risk of death or CHF. Currently, the feline N-terminal-proBrainnatriuretic peptide test is the only potential screening test for detectingoccult HCM. However, some cardiologists have pointed out the poor sensitivity of the test precludes its use as a screening test. This interpretation appearssomewhat flawed. Using the current rapid test will allow clinicians to correctly identify half of the cats with moderate-to-severe occult HCM. A small number ofcats without HCM will also test positive, necessitating an ultimately needlessechocardiographic evaluation to demonstrate their disease-free status. However,the low prevalence of HCM in the general cat population and the apparently muchlower rate of adverse events than would be predicted brings into question whetherclinicians should bother screening. Therefore, until a more sensitive andaccurate screening test becomes available, clinicians will have to decide forthemselves whether identifying half of the at-risk cats of sudden death and CHFwith this test is better than identifying none of them.

LID - 10.1161/JAHA.122.026071 [doi]
AB  - Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) remains a medical anomaly that baffles researchers and physicians alike. The overall phenotypical changesof diastolic function and left ventricular hypertrophy observed in HFpEF aredefinable; however, the metabolic and molecular alterations that ultimatelyproduce these changes are not well established. Comorbidities such as obesity,hypertension, and diabetes, as well as general aging, play crucial roles in itsdevelopment and progression. Various animal models have recently been developedto better understand the pathophysiological and metabolic developments in HFpEFand to illuminate novel avenues for pharmacotherapy. These models includemulti-hit rodents and feline aortic constriction animals. Recently, genomic,proteomic, and metabolomic approaches have been used to define altered signaling pathways in the heart associated with HFpEF, including those involved ininflammation, cGMP-related, Ca(2+) handling, mitochondrial respiration, and theunfolded protein response in endoplasmic reticulum stress. This article aims topresent an overview of what has been learnt by these studies, focusing mainly on the findings in common while highlighting unresolved issues. The knowledge gainedfrom these research models will not simply be of benefit for treating HFpEF butwill undoubtedly provide new insights into the mechanisms by which the heartdeals with external stresses and how the processes involved can fail.

TI  - Evaluation of symmetric dimethylarginine in cats with acute kidney injury andchronic kidney disease.
LID - 10.1111/jvim.16497 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) concentrations are considereda biomarker for renal dysfunction in dogs and humans with acute kidney injury(AKI). No studies have assessed SDMA in cats with AKI. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES:SDMA correctly identifies cats with azotemic AKI. ANIMALS: Fifteen control cats, 22 with novel AKI, 13 with acute on chronic-AKI (AoC) and 19 with chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: Retrospective study. Cats with azotemia (serum creatinineconcentrations >1.7 mg/dL) were defined as having AKI or CKD based on history,clinical signs, clinicopathological findings and diagnostic imaging, andclassified using the International Renal Interest Society (IRIS) grading/staging systems. Serum SDMA concentrations were compared between groups withnonparametric methods, and correlations assessed using Spearman's correlationcoefficient. Data are presented as median [range]. RESULTS: SDMA concentrationswere 11 (8-21) mug/dL, 36 (9-170)mug/dL, 33 (22-75) mug/dL and 25 (12-69) mug/dL in control, novel AKI, AoC and CKD cats. SDMA concentrations were significantlyhigher in cats with novel AKI (P < .001), AoC (P < .001) and CKD (P < .01)compared to controls. SDMA concentrations were significantly higher in cats with more advanced AKI (IRIS grade IV-V) compared to less severe AKI (IRIS grade II). Serum creatinine and SDMA concentrations had a significant correlation in catswith novel AKI (rs = 0.826, n = 22; P < .001) and a significant correlation when all cats across all 4 groups were considered together (rs = 0.837, n = 69; P <.001). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Serum SDMA concentrations areelevated in cats with established AKI (novel and AoC) and CKD, providing evidencefor use of SDMA as a biomarker for AKI in cats.

TI  - Rapid recovery of male cats with postrenal acute kidney injury by treating withallogeneic adipose mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a complex disease and can be generallydivided into prerenal, intrarenal, and postrenal AKI (PR-AKI). Previous studieshave shown that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-derived extracellular vesicles haveprotective function on prerenal and intrarenal AKI treatment, but whether theyhave therapeutic efficacy on PR-AKI remains unclear. In this study, weinvestigated the therapeutic efficacy of allogeneic adipose mesenchymal stemcell-derived extracellular vesicles (ADMSCEVs) on cat models of PR-AKI. METHODS: The cat models of PR-AKI were established by using artificial urinary occlusionand then treated with ADMSCEVs. Histopathological section analysis, blood routineanalysis, plasma biochemical test, imaging analysis, and plasma ultra-highperformance liquid chromatography-MS/MS (UHPLC-MS/MS) were performed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of ADMSCEVs. RESULTS: Physiological and biochemical testshowed that the ADMSCEVs could recover creatinine, urea nitrogen and plasmaphosphorus to homeostasis efficiently. Blood routine analysis showed thatleukocytes in PR-AKI cats with ADMSCEVs treatment returned to normalphysiological range more quickly than that of control. UHPLC-MS/MS analysisrevealed that the plasma metabolome profile of PR-AKI cats treated with ADMSCEVs was highly similar to that of normal cats. Furthermore, UHPLC-MS/MS analysis alsorevealed six metabolites (carnitine, melibiose, D-Glucosamine, cytidine,dihydroorotic acid, stachyose) in plasma were highly correlated with the dynamic process of PR-AKI on cats. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the efficacy of ADMSCEVsin the treatment of PR-AKI on cats. Our study also suggests six metabolites to benovel PR-AKI markers and to be potential targets for ADMSCEVs therapy. Ourfindings will be useful to improve clinical treatment of both animal and humanPR-AKI patients with ADMSCEVs in the future.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To construct a Felis catus STR loci multiplex amplification systemand to evaluate its application value by testing the technical performance.METHODS: The published Felis catus STR loci data were reviewed and analyzed toselect the STR loci and sex identification loci that could be used for Feliscatus individual identification and genetic identification. The fluorescentlabeling primers were designed to construct the multiplex amplification system.The system was validated for sensitivity, accuracy, balance, stability, speciesspecificity, tissue identity and mixture analysis, and investigated the geneticpolymorphisms in 145 unrelated Felis catus samples. RESULTS: Sixteen Felis catus autosomal STR loci and one sex determining region of Y (SRY) were successfullyselected, and constructed a multiplex amplification system containing the aboveloci. The complete profile of all alleles could still be obtained when the amountof DNA template was as low as 0.25 ng. There was no specific amplification peakin other common animal samples. Population genetic surveys showed that totaldiscrimination power (TDP) of the 16 STR loci was 1-3.57x10(-20), the cumulative probability of exclusion (CPE) was 1-6.35x10(-5) and the cumulative probabilityof matching was 3.61x10(-20). CONCLUSIONS: The Felis catus STR multiplexamplification system constructed in this study is highly sensitive,species-specific, and accurate in typing results, which can provide an effective solution for Felis catus species identification, individual identification andkinship identification in the field of forensic science.

AB  - Feline calicivirus (FCV) is a well-known causative pathogen for upper respiratoryinfection in cats. Its high genetic variability challenges existing moleculardiagnostic methods in clinical settings. Thus, we developed two sensitive andvisual assays for FCV nucleic acid detection based on RPA reaction andCRISPR-Cas13a trans-cleavage activity. Recombinant plasmid DNA, crRNAs, and RPAprimers were designed and prepared, respectively, targeting to FCV ORF1 gene.Besides, purified LwCas13a protein was produced by E.coli prokaryotic expression system. To confirm the validity of FCV-Cas13a assays, seven reaction systems(RSs) with different components were tested, and visual readouts were displayedby lateral flow dipstick (FCV-Cas13a-LFD) and fluorescence detector(FCV-Cas13a-FLUOR), respectively. The established FCV-Cas13a assays were capable of detecting FCV nucleic acid in presetting RSs without cross-reaction with otherfeline-associated pathogens, and the detection limit was as low as 5.5 copies/mulfor both visual methods. Moreover, the positive rate of 56 clinical specimensdetected by FCV-Cas13a assays (67.9%, 38/56) was notably higher than that ofRT-qPCR (44.6%, 25/56) (p < 0.001), including 13 presumptive positive specimens. Taken together, FCV-Cas13a assays provided reliable and visual diagnosticalternatives for FCV field detection.

TI  - From the Balkan towards Western Europe: Range expansion of the golden jackal(Canis aureus)-A climatic niche modeling approach.
PG  - e9141
LID - 10.1002/ece3.9141 [doi]
AB  - In recent decades, a rapid range expansion of the golden jackal (Canis aureus)towards Northern and Western Europe has been observed. The golden jackal is amedium-sized canid, with a broad and flexible diet. Almost 200 different parasitespecies have been reported worldwide from C. aureus, including many parasitesthat are shared with dogs and cats and parasite species of public health concern.As parasites may follow the range shifts of their host, the range expansion ofthe golden jackal could be accompanied by changes in the parasite fauna in thenew ecosystems. In the new distribution area, the golden jackal could affectecosystem equilibrium, e.g., through changed competition situations or predation pressure. In a niche modeling approach, we project the future climatic habitatsuitability of the golden jackal in Europe in the context of whether climaticchanges promote range expansion. We use an ensemble forecast based on sixpresence-absence algorithms to estimate the climatic suitability of C. aureus fordifferent time periods up to the year 2100 considering different IPCC scenarioson future development. As predictor variables, we used six bioclimatic variables provided by worldclim. Our results clearly indicate that areas with climaticconditions analogous to those of the current core distribution area of the goldenjackal in Europe will strongly expand towards the north and the west in futuredecades. Thus, the observed range expansion may be favored by climate change. Theoccurrence of stable populations can be expected in Central Europe. With regardto biodiversity and public health concerns, the population and range dynamics of the golden jackal should be surveyed. Correlative niche models provide a usefuland frequently applied tool for this purpose. The results can help to makemonitoring more efficient by identifying areas with suitable habitat and thus ahigher probability of occurrence.

TI  - Adaptive Modular Convolutional Neural Network for Image Recognition.
LID - 5488 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22155488 [doi]
AB  - Image recognition has long been one of the research hotspots in computer visiontasks. The development of deep learning is rapid in recent years, andconvolutional neural networks usually need to be designed with fixed resources.If sufficient resources are available, the model can be scaled up to achievehigher accuracy, for example, VggNet, ResNet, GoogLeNet, etc. Although theaccuracy of large-scale models has been improved, the following problems willoccur with the expansion of model scale: (1) There may be over-fitting; (2)increasing model parameters; (3) slow model convergence. This paper proposes adesign method for a modular convolutional neural network model which solves theproblem of over-fitting and large model parameters by connecting multiple modulesin parallel. Moreover, each module contains several submodules (three submodules in this paper) and fuses the features extracted from the submodules. The modelconvergence can be accelerated by using the fused features (the fused featurescontain more image information). In this study, we add a gate unit based on theattention mechanism to the model, which aims to optimize the structure of themodel (select the optimal number of modules), allowing the model to select anoptimum network structure by learning and dynamically reducing FLOPs(floating-point operations per second) of the model. Compared to VggNet, ResNet, and GoogLeNet, the structure of the model proposed in this paper is simple andthe parameters are small. The proposed model achieves good results in the Kaggle datasets Cats-vs.-Dogs (99.3%), 10-Monkey Species (99.26%), and Birds-400(99.13%).

TI  - Endotracheal intubation in rabbits using a video laryngoscope with a modifiedblade.

AB  - Rabbits are being increasingly used as companion animals, and in research; thus, the need for proper veterinary care for rabbits has increased. Surgical access ismore challenging in rabbits under inhalation anesthesia compared to otheranimals, such as dogs and cats. Rabbits have a very narrow and deep oral cavity, large incisors, and a large tongue. Moreover, their temporomandibular joint haslimited mobility, making it more difficult to approach the larynx. Variousmethods have been proposed to overcome this difficulty. The video laryngoscopewas introduced in 1999 and is useful when airway intubation is unsuccessful usinga conventional laryngoscope. We postulated that a video laryngoscope with amodified size 1 Macintosh blade (McGrath MAC Video Laryngoscope, Medtronic, USA) would facilitate the intubation of New Zealand White rabbits. Sixteenspecific-pathogen-free male New Zealand White rabbits weighing 3.45-4.70 kg were studied. All rabbits were intubated using the video laryngoscope. Typically, a3.0 mm endotracheal tube was used for rabbits weighing < 4 kg, while a 3.5 mmtube was used in those weighing > 4 kg. During surgery, anesthesia was wellmaintained, and there were no major abnormalities in the animals' conditions. No rabbit developed breathing difficulties or anorexia after recovering fromanesthesia. We established an intubation method using a video laryngoscope with amodified blade and stylet in the supine (ventrodorsal) position and successfully applied it in 16 rabbits. It is useful for training novices and for treatingrabbits in veterinary hospitals with few staff members and animal researchfacilities where there are insufficient human resources.

TI  - Stable isotopes unveil one millennium of domestic cat paleoecology in Europe.
PG  - 12775
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-16969-8 [doi]
AB  - The domestic cat is the world's most popular pet and one of the most detrimental predators in terrestrial ecosystems. Effective protection of wildlifebiodiversity demands detailed tracking of cat trophic ecology, and stableisotopes serve as a powerful proxy in dietary studies. However, a variable dietcan make an isotopic pattern unreadable in opportunistic predators. To evaluatethe usefulness of the isotopic method in cat ecology, we measured C and N isotoperatios in hundreds of archaeological cat bones. We determined trends in cattrophic paleoecology in northern Europe by exploiting population-scale patternsin animals from diverse locations. Our dataset shows a high variability ofisotopic signals related to the socio-economic and/or geomorphological context.This points toward regularities in isotopic patterns across past cat populations.We provide a generalized guide to interpret the isotopic ecology of cats,emphasizing that regional isotopic baselines have a major impact on the isotopic signal.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of Escherichia albertii from wild and safeguarded animals in Okayama Prefecture and its prefectural borders, Japan.
LID - 10.1292/jvms.22-0213 [doi]
AB  - Escherichia albertii has recently been recognized as a zoonotic enteropathogenassociated with food-poisoning. The reservoirs and transmission routes of thisbacterium to humans are still unclear. In this study, we performed a survey of E.albertii in fecal specimens of wild and safeguarded animals in Okayama Prefectureand its prefectural borders, Japan to understand its reservoir in theenvironment. Forty-two E. albertii were isolated from 10 and 31 droppings of 59crows and 125 starlings, respectively. Fifty-two E. albertii were isolated from906 mammal droppings, and out of 52 isolates, origin of 33, 6 and 1 isolates werefrom martens, foxes, and rabbit, respectively, however, origin of 12 isolatesremained unknown. Three E. albertii were isolated from two and one feces of 159dogs and 76 cats, respectively. Pulsed-filed gel electrophoresis analysis grouped97 E. albertii strains into 66 pulsotypes including 36 and 30 pulsotypes ofisolates from mammals and birds, respectively. E. albertii strains isolated inthis study were genetically diverse. Although clonal relationship was notobserved between mammal and bird isolates, there were intra- and inter-speciesrelationship in mammalian isolates. All E. albertii strains were positive for eaeand Eacdt virulencegenes. Furthermore, 20 and 7 strains also carried Eccdt-I and stx2f genes, respectively. Taken together, the results indicate that genetically diverse and potentially virulent E. albertii are distributed among various wildand safeguarded animals in Okayama Prefecture, and the animals could also bereservoirs of E. albertii.

TI  - Biomechanical evaluation of locking versus nonlocking 2.0-mm malleableL-miniplate fixation of simulated caudal mandibular fractures in cats.

LID - ajvr.22.03.0043 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the biomechanical properties of the mandibles of cats withexperimentally created osteotomies simulating oblique ramus fractures, which werestabilized with malleable L-miniplates with either locking screws [lockingconstruct (LC)] or nonlocking screws [nonlocking construct (NLC)], compared with those for intact mandibles. SAMPLES: 20 mandibles from 10 adult cat cadavers.PROCEDURES: A block study design was adopted to allocate the mandibles of eachcadaver to 2 of the 3 test groups (LC, NLC, or intact mandible). Mandibles withineach cadaver were allocated systematically to a test group. For mandiblesassigned to an LC and an NLC, a complete oblique osteotomy was performed from themid rostral aspect of the ramus in a caudoventral direction. All mandibles wereloaded in a single-load-to-failure test through cantilever bending. Load andactuator displacement were recorded simultaneously. Mode of failure andradiographic evidence of damage to tooth roots and the mandibular canal wereevaluated. Biomechanical properties were compared among the groups. RESULTS: Noiatrogenic tooth root damage was evident, but all mandibles with an LC and an NLChad evidence of screw invasion into the mandibular canal. Plated mandibles hadsignificantly less stiffness and bending moment than intact mandibles. Stiffness was not significantly different between the LC and the NLC; the NLC had a greaterbending moment at failure than the LC. The pre-yield stiffness of platedmandibles decreased when the number of screw holes overlapping the mandibularcanal increased. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The use of a malleable L-miniplate in acaudal mandibular fracture model is feasible. Both the LC and the NLC wereinferior mechanically to intact mandibles. Type of construct used did not affect the construct stiffness significantly in tested mandibles.

LID - 10.2460/ajvr.22.02.0023 [doi]
LID - ajvr.22.02.0023 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Compare changes in intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), abdominal perfusionpressure (APP), hemodynamics, and clinicopathological variables in nonpregnantand late-term pregnant queens undergoing elective ovariohysterectomy (OHE) andevaluate the effect of patient positioning on IAP and APP measurements. ANIMALS: 18 late-term pregnant queens and 25 nonpregnant controls. PROCEDURES:Temperature, heart rate (HR), Doppler blood pressure (DBP), IAP (dorsal and rightlateral), PCV, total protein (TP), and lactate were recorded preoperatively, atabdominal wall closure (dorsal IAP only), and postoperatively under generalanesthesia. Uterine weight, blood loss, and surgical duration were recorded.Abdominal perfusion pressure was calculated as DBP minus IAP. RESULTS: Pre- andpostoperatively, pregnant queens had lower DBP, APP, and PCV compared to controls(P < 0.001). IAP was higher in pregnant queens preoperatively (P < 0.001).Controls had a decrease in HR and increase in IAP, while both groups had adecrease in body temperature, DBP, APP, and lactate over time (P < 0.05).Pregnant queens had a decrease (P = 0.029), and controls had an increase in TP (P= 0.001). Blood loss and surgical time were greater for pregnant queens (P <0.001). Dorsal IAP and APP were higher and lower than right lateral measurements (P < 0.001), respectively, and correlation was strong. CLINICAL RELEVANCE:Hemodynamics and APP are impaired in late-term pregnant queens undergoing OHE,and increased monitoring is warranted. Although strongly correlated, feline IAPand APP measurements in dorsal and right lateral recumbency are notinterchangeable.

TI  - Correlations between behavior and hormone concentrations or gut microbiome imply that domestic cats (Felis silvestris catus) living in a group are not like'groupmates'.
PG  - e0269589
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0269589 [doi]
AB  - Domestic cats (Felis silvestris catus) can live in high densities, although most feline species are solitary and exclusively territorial animals; it is possiblethat certain behavioral strategies enable this phenomenon. These behaviors areregulated by hormones and the gut microbiome, which, in turn, is influenced bydomestication. Therefore, we investigated the relationships between thesociality, hormone concentrations, and gut microbiome of domestic cats byconducting three sets of experiments for each group of five cats and analyzingtheir behavior, hormone concentrations (cortisol, oxytocin, and testosterone),and their gut microbiomes. We observed that individuals with high cortisol andtestosterone concentrations established less contact with others, and individualswith high oxytocin concentrations did not exhibit affiliative behaviors as muchas expected. Additionally, the higher the frequency of contact among theindividuals, the greater the similarity in gut microbiome; gut microbialcomposition was also related to behavioral patterns and cortisol secretion.Notably, individuals with low cortisol and testosterone concentrations werehighly tolerant, making high-density living easy. Oxytocin usually functions inan affiliative manner within groups, but our results suggest that even iftypically solitary and territorial animals live in high densities, their oxytocinfunctions are opposite to those of typically group-living animals.

AB  - Flea-borne spotted fever is an emerging insect-borne rickettsial infection causedby Rickettsia felis and has been identified worldwide. This study sought toexplore the prevalence of rickettsiae associated with fleas on companion dogs andcats from Walker and Montgomery Counties in East Texas. Fleas were collected fromanimals entering local veterinary clinics for routine checkups. Collected fleaswere identified as Ctenocephalides felis or Pulex irritans and analyzed bypolymerase chain reaction for the presence of rickettsiae and subsequentsequencing. An estimation of the bcMLE (bias-corrected maximum likelihoodestimation) of pooled samples was calculated. Four hundred eighty-eight fleas(comprising C. felis and P. irritans) were collected from 16 cats and 77 dogs.Our results demonstrate R. felis in 21 pools of fleas from dogs (bcMLE 15.28%)and a bcMLE of 7.25% from flea samples collected from cats. Sequence analysisrevealed R. felis as the only Rickettsia that could be amplified in our samplesusing the rickettsial citrate synthase gene and subsequent sequencing. In thisstudy, the presence of R. felis in fleas from companion cats and dogs suggests a potential risk of flea-borne spotted fever in humans who encounter flea-infested animals.

LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14081548 [doi]
AB  - Bupivacaine is commonly used for peripheral nerve block in veterinary medicine.This study described the pharmacokinetics of two doses of bupivacaine followingadministration by an ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block incats undergoing ovariohysterectomy. Twelve healthy female adult cats wereincluded in a randomized, prospective, blinded clinical trial. Anaestheticprotocol included acepromazine-buprenorphine-propofol-isoflurane-meloxicam. Each cat received 1 mL/kg of bupivacaine 0.2% or 0.25% (BUPI-2 and BUPI-2.5,respectively) via bilateral two-point TAP block before surgery (n = 6/group).Plasma concentrations of bupivacaine were detected using liquidchromatography-mass spectrometry. A one-compartment model and non-compartmentalanalysis described the pharmacokinetic parameters. Bupivacaine was detected up to480 min (335 +/- 76 in BUPI-2 and 485 +/- 198 ng/mL in BUPI-2.5). For BUPI-2 and BUPI-2.5, maximum plasma concentrations were 1166 +/- 511 and 1810 +/- 536 ng/mL at 33 +/- 14 and 47 +/- 22 min, clearance was 5.3 +/- 1.8 and 4.9 +/- 1.5mL/min/kg, and elimination half-life were 253 +/- 55 and 217 +/- 52 min,respectively. The two doses of bupivacaine via TAP block produced concentrations below toxic levels in cats. A dose of 2.5 mg/kg bupivacaine was safe to beadministered using this block in healthy cats.

AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) haveemerged as non-invasive diagnostic techniques for the diagnosis of pancreatic andpancreatic duct disorders in humans. The number of studies focused on MR and MRCPfor pancreatic disease in small animals is very limited. MR has been describedfor the evaluation of insulinoma in dogs and to investigate pancreatitis in cats.The studies were based on a standard protocol with T2 weighted (w) fast recovery fast spin-echo (FRFSE) with and without fat suppression, T1w FSE pre-contrast andT1w FSE post-contrast with and without fat suppression. MRCP after secretinstimulation has been described in cats to assess the pancreatic ductal system,taking advantage of pulse sequences heavily T2w as rapid acquisition with rapidenhancement (RARE), fast-recovery fast spin-echo (FRFSE) sequences andsingle-shot fast spin-echo (SSFSE) sequences. In addition to the standardprotocol, fast spoiled gradient recalled echo pulse sequences (fSPGR) and volume interpolated 3D gradient-echo T1w pulse sequences pre and post-contrast have alsobeen used in cats, reaching the goal of assessing the biliary tree and thepancreatic duct with the same sequence and in multiple planes. Despite the small amount of data, the results show potential, and the most recent technicalinnovations, in particular, focused on diffusion MRI and fast acquisition,further support the need for continued evaluation of MRI as an effectiveinstrument for the investigation of pancreatic disease.

TI  - Vaccination and Antibody Testing in Cats.
LID - 1602 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14081602 [doi]
AB  - Vaccines protect cats from serious diseases by inducing antibodies and cellularimmune responses. Primary vaccinations and boosters are given according tovaccination guidelines provided by industry and veterinary organizations, basedon minimal duration of immunity (DOI). For certain diseases, particularly feline panleukopenia, antibody titres correlate with protection. For feline calicivirus and feline herpesvirus, a similar correlation is absent, or less clear. In thisreview, the European Advisory Board on Cat Diseases (ABCD) presents currentknowledge and expert opinion on the use of antibody testing in differentsituations. Antibody testing can be performed either in diagnostic laboratories, or in veterinary practice using point of care (POC) tests, and can be applied forseveral purposes, such as to provide evidence that a successful immune responsewas induced following vaccination. In adult cats, antibody test results caninform the appropriate re-vaccination interval. In shelters, antibody testing cansupport the control of FPV outbreaks by identifying potentially unprotected cats.Antibody testing has also been proposed to support decisions on optimalvaccination schedules for the individual kitten. However, such testing is stillexpensive and it is considered impractical to monitor the decline of maternallyderived antibodies.

LID - 1432 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antiox11081432 [doi]
AB  - Heart failure occurs in increased oxidative stress conditions, which contributeto the progression of pathological changes. Orally or intravenously administered acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin) is typically used in human patients withacute myocardial ischemia. The study used an experimental porcineischemia-reperfusion model to evaluate the potential cardioprotective effect ofintracoronary administered ASA on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Thecardioprotective effect of ASA was evaluated by measuring selected oxidativestress markers levels in infarcted and non-infarcted myocardium 14 days after theprocedure, and three times in serum, before the procedure, during the reperfusionprocess, and after 14-day recovery. The results showed that intracoronaryadministrated ASA reduced the oxidative stress. The level of oxidative stress,measured with the non-enzymatic markers total antioxidant capacity (TAC), totaloxidative status (TOS), and malondialdehyde (MDA), and the enzymatic markersglutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathioneS-transferase (GST), in heart tissue was significantly higher in a control group injected with saline. The level of oxidative stress in serum, measured with TAC, TOS, oxidative stress index (OSI), and lipofuscin (LF), was also higher in thecontrol group than in animals injected with ASA. The confirmed cardioprotectiveeffect of intracoronary administered ASA provides the foundation for furtherstudies on ASA intracoronary application, which may lead to the development of a new therapy for the treatment of ischemia-reperfusion complications in humans.

TI  - Interspecific Contagious Yawning in Humans.
LID - 1908 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12151908 [doi]
AB  - Contagious yawning, or the reflexive tendency to yawn following the detection of yawning in others, is well-documented among humans and a growing number of socialvertebrates. While the most common form of yawn contagion occurs betweenconspecifics, some non-human animals in captivity have been reported to yawn inresponse to yawns from human handlers/caregivers. The current research sought to provide the first formal investigation of whether people yawn contagiously inresponse to yawns from non-human animals. In addition, this study aimed to testwhether this response was modulated by phylogenetic relatedness anddomestication/social closeness. A total of 296 participants from AmazonMechanical Turk self-reported on their yawning behavior following exposure to a(1) control (non-yawning) condition or a compilation of yawning stimuli eitherfrom (2) fish, (3) amphibians, (4) reptiles, (5) birds, (6) non-primate mammals, (7) apes, or (8) domesticated cats and dogs. The results provide strong supportfor interspecific yawn contagion. However, neither the propensity to yawn(binary) nor total yawn frequency varied significantly across interspecificconditions. Overall, these findings suggest that the mechanisms governing yawncontagion can be activated by varied forms of yawning stimuli, including thosefrom distantly related and unfamiliar species.

AB  - Tigers (Panthera tigris) are flagship big cats and attract extensive publicattention due to their charismatic features and endangered status. Despite this, little is known about their prehistoric lineages and detailed evolutionaryhistories. Through palaeogenomic analyses, we identified a Pleistocene tiger fromnortheastern China, dated to beyond the limits of radiocarbon dating (greaterthan 43 500 years ago). We used a simulated dataset and different readsprocessing pipelines to test the validity of our results and confirmed that, inboth mitochondrial and nuclear phylogenies, this ancient individual belongs to a previously unknown lineage that diverged prior to modern tiger diversification.Based on the mitochondrial genome, the divergence time of this ancient lineagewas estimated to be approximately 268 ka (95% CI: 187-353 ka), doubling the knownage of tigers' maternal ancestor to around 125 ka (95% CI: 88-168 ka).Furthermore, by combining our findings with putative mechanisms underlying thediscordant mito-nuclear phylogenetic placement for the South China tigers, weproposed a more complex scenario of tiger evolution that would otherwise bemissed using data from modern tigers only. Our study provides the first glimpses of the genetic antiquity of tigers and demonstrates the utility of aDNA-basedinvestigation for further understanding tiger evolution.

TI  - Hepadnavirus DNA Is Detected in Canine Blood Samples in Hong Kong but Not inLiver Biopsies of Chronic Hepatitis or Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
LID - 1543 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14071543 [doi]
AB  - Chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) caused by the hepadnavirushepatitis B virus (HBV) are significant causes of human mortality. Ahepatitis-B-like virus infecting cats, domestic cat hepadnavirus (DCH), wasreported in 2018. DCH DNA is hepatotropic and detectable in feline blood or serum(3.2 to 12.3%). Detection of HBV DNA has been reported in sera from 10% offree-roaming dogs in Brazil, whereas 6.3% of sera from dogs in Italy testedpositive for DCH DNA by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). If DCH, HBV, oranother hepadnavirus is hepatotropic in dogs, a role for such a virus in theetiology of canine idiopathic chronic hepatitis (CH) or HCC warrantsinvestigation. This study investigated whether DCH DNA could be detected via qPCRin blood from dogs in Hong Kong and also whether liver biopsies from dogs withconfirmed idiopathic CH or HCC contained hepadnaviral DNA using twopanhepadnavirus conventional PCRs (cPCR) and a DCH-specific cPCR. DCH DNA wasamplified from 2 of 501 (0.4%) canine whole-blood DNA samples. A second sampletaken 6 or 7 months later from each dog tested negative in DCH qPCR. DNAextracted from 101 liver biopsies from dogs in Hong Kong or the USA, diagnosed byboard-certified pathologists as idiopathic CH (n = 47) or HCC (n = 54), testednegative for DCH DNA and also tested negative using panhepadnavirus cPCRs. Thisstudy confirms that DCH DNA can be detected in canine blood by qPCR, although at a much lower prevalence than that reported previously. We identified no evidence to support a pathogenic role for a hepadnavirus in canine idiopathic CH or HCC.

TI  - In Vitro Growth, Receptor Usage and Pathogenesis of Feline Morbillivirus in theNatural Host.
LID - 1503 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14071503 [doi]
AB  - Feline morbillivirus (FeMV) is a recently discovered virus belonging to the genusMorbillivirus of the virus family Paramyxoviridae. Often, the virus has beendetected in urine of cats with a history of urinary disease and has a worldwidedistribution. Currently, it is unclear which receptor the virus uses to enter thetarget cells. Furthermore, many aspects of FeMV biology in vivo, including tissuetropism, pathogenesis, and virus excretion in the natural host remain unclear. Inthis study we analyzed the replication of FeMV in various cell lines. Secondly,we tested if the presence of feline SLAMF1 (Signaling Lymphocytic ActivationMolecule family 1/CD150, principal entry receptor for other members of theMorbillivirus genus) improved FeMV replication efficiency in vitro. Finally, toelucidate in vivo biology in cats, as a natural host for FeMV, we experimentally infected a group of cats and monitored clinical symptoms, viremia, and excretion of the virus during the course of 56 days. Our study showed that FeMV shares somefeatures with other morbilliviruses like the use of the SLAMF1 receptor. For the first time, experimental infection of SPF cats showed that FeMV does not inducean acute clinical disease like other morbilliviruses but can induce lesions inthe kidneys, including tubulointerstitial nephritis. Further investigations areneeded to confirm the site and dynamics of replication of FeMV in the urinarytract and the longer-term impact of FeMV-induced lesions on the renal function.Whether FeMV infection can result in chronic kidney disease will require themonitoring of cats over a longer period.

LID - 10.3390/v14071412 [doi]
AB  - Feline panleukopenia (FPL), a highly contagious and frequently fatal disease ofcats, is caused by Feline parvovirus (FPV) and Canine parvovirus (CPV). Wecharacterised the diversity of these Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 variants in 18faecal samples collected from domestic cats with FPL during an outbreak, usingtargeted parvoviral DNA metagenomics to a mean depth of &gt;10,000 x coverage persite. All samples comprised FPV alone. Compared with the reference FPV genome,isolated in 1967, 44 mutations were detected. Ten of these were nonsynonymous,including 9 in nonstructural genes and one in VP1/VP2 (Val232Ile), which was the only one to exhibit interhost diversity, being present in five sequences. Therewere five other polymorphic nucleotide positions, all with synonymous mutations. Intrahost diversity at all polymorphic positions was low, with subconsensusvariant frequencies (SVF) of &lt;1% except for two positions (2108 and 3208) intwo samples with SVF of 1.1-1.3%. Intrahost nucleotide diversity was measuredacross the whole genome (0.7-1.5%) and for each gene and was highest in the NS2gene of four samples (1.2-1.9%). Overall, intrahost viral genetic diversity waslimited and most mutations observed were synonymous, indicative of a lowbackground mutation rate and strong selective constraints.

TI  - Serotype I and II Feline Coronavirus Replication and Gene Expression Patterns of Feline Cells-Building a Better Understanding of Serotype I FIPV Biology.
LID - 1356 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14071356 [doi]
AB  - Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a disease of domestic cats caused by thegenetic variant of the feline coronavirus (FCoV) and feline infectiousperitonitis virus (FIPV), currently grouped into two serotypes, I and II.Although serotype I FIPV is more prevalent in cats with FIP, serotype II has beenmore extensively studied in vitro due to the relative ease in propagating thisviral serotype in culture systems. As a result, more is known about serotype IIFIPV than the more biologically prevalent serotype I. The primary cell receptorfor serotype II has been determined, while it remains unknown for serotype I. Therecent development of a culture-adapted feline cell line that more effectivelypropagates serotype I FIPV, FCWF-4 CU, derived from FCWF-4 cells availablethrough the ATCC, offers the potential for an improved understanding of serotype I FIPV biology. To learn more about FIPV receptor biology, we determined targetedgene expression patterns in feline cells variably permissive to replication ofserotype I or II FIPV. We utilized normal feline tissues to determine theimmunohistochemical expression patterns of two known coronavirus receptors, ACE2 and DC-SIGN. Lastly, we compared the global transcriptomes of the two closelyrelated FCWF-4 cell lines and identified viral transcripts with potentialimportance for the differential replication kinetics of serotype I FIPV.

TI  - Gurltia paralysans: A Neglected Angio-Neurotropic Parasite of Domestic Cats(Felis catus) and Free-Ranging Wild Felids (Leopardus spp.) in South America.
LID - 792 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pathogens11070792 [doi]
AB  - Gurltia paralysans is a neglected and re-emerging metastrongyloidangio-neurotropic nematode causing severe chronic meningomyelitis in domesticcats (Felis catus) as well as in free-ranging small wild felids such as kodkods(Leopardus guigna), margays (Leopardus wiedii) and the northern tiger cat(Leopardus triginus) in South America. Within these definitive hosts (DH), adult males and females of G. paralysans parasitize the leptomeningeal veins of thesubarachnoid space and/or the meningeal veins of spinal cord parenchyma, inducingvascular alterations. Feline gurltiosis has been associated with progressivethrombophlebitis of the meningeal veins, resulting in ambulatory paraparesis,paraplegia, ataxia, hindlimb proprioceptive deficit, uni- or bilateralhyperactive patellar reflexes, faecal and urinary incontinence, and tailparalysis. The complete life cycle of G. paralysans has not been elucidated yet, but most probably involves gastropods as obligate intermediate hosts (IH). Interms of epidemiology, G. paralysans infections in domestic and wild felids arescattered around various South American countries, with hyperendemic areas insouthern parts of Chile. Etiological diagnosis of G. paralysans still represents a challenge for clinicians due to a lack of evidence of the excretion of eithereggs or larvae in faeces or in other body fluids. Diagnosis is based on clinical neurological signs, imaging findings through computed tomography (CT),myelography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and post mortem examination.Nonetheless, novel diagnostic tools have been developed, including semi-nestedPCR for detecting circulating G. paralysans DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid, serumand blood samples as well as in serological diagnostic kits detectingparasite-derived antigens, but these need validation for routine usage. Thehypothetical life cycle of G. paralysans is addressed in this article, including the exogenous stages (i.e., eggs, and first- (L1), second- (L2) and third-stage(L3) larvae) and obligate gastropod IH and/or paratenic hosts (PH), and wepropose possible anatomical migration routes of infective L3 that reach theleptomeningeal veins in vivo. Finally, the pro-inflammatory endothelium- andleukocyte-derived innate immune reactions of the host against G. paralysans,which most likely result in thrombophlebitis and meningomyelitis, are brieflytouched on.

TI  - Molecular Survey of Bartonella Species in Stray Cats and Dogs, Humans, andQuesting Ticks from Portugal.
LID - 749 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pathogens11070749 [doi]
AB  - Bartonella spp. comprises emergent and re-emergent fastidious Gram-negativebacteria with worldwide distribution. Cats are the main reservoir hosts forBartonella henselae and dogs represent opportunistic hosts for the bacteria. Eventhough ticks may also play a role in transmission, their competence as vectorsfor Bartonella spp. has not been totally understood. Considering only a fewstudies had a focus on screening Bartonella in animals, humans and ectoparasites in Portugal, this study aimed to address the molecular occurrence of Bartonellasp. in 123 stray cats, 25 stray dogs, 30 humans from Lisbon and 236 questingticks within the country. Using a qPCR targeting the nuoG gene, it was possibleto detect Bartonella sp. DNA on 20.32% of cat samples (25/123). From thesepositive samples, 13 sequences were characterized as B. henselae, 11 as B.clarridgeiae and 1 presented co-infection with both species. The absolutequantification of nuoGBartonella DNA in sampled cats ranged from 2.78 x 10 to1.03 x 10(5) copies/microL. The sampled dogs, humans and ticks were negative.These results showed that B. henselae and B. clarridgeiae are circulating instray cats from Lisbon. Additional and more extended studies should be conducted to determine the impact of such infections on humans, particularly those inconstant and direct contact with cats.

LID - 731 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pathogens11070731 [doi]
AB  - Norovirus (NoV) infection remains a major public health concern worldwide.Appropriate animal models are essential for the development of effective NoVvaccines. We previously established the feline NoV (FNoV)-cat model as asurrogate animal model for human NoV infection. In the present study, we analyzedthe B-cell linear epitope in the P domain of FNoV to confirm the basicimmunological features of the FNoV-cat model. B-cell linear epitopes were presentin the P2 subdomain. We compared antibody levels to peptides containing theB-cell linear epitope (P-10) in three FNoV-infected cats with time-course changesin viral load and symptom scoring. After FNoV infection, viral shedding andclinical symptoms were shown to improve by elevated levels of antibodies against P-10 in the plasma. This report provides important information for understanding NoV infections in humans and cats.

LID - 749 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jof8070749 [doi]
AB  - Feline sporotrichosis is enzootic in different regions of Brazil, especially inRio de Janeiro. This study compared the genotype profiles of Sporothrix sp.isolated from cats in Rio de Janeiro between 1998 and 2018 and evaluated theirassociation with clinical and epidemiological characteristics. One hundrednineteen Sporothrix sp. isolates from a cohort of cats with sporotrichosis seenat INI/Fiocruz were included. Clinical and epidemiological data were obtainedfrom the medical records of the animals. T3B PCR fingerprinting was used formolecular identification of the Sporothrix species. All isolates werecharacterized as Sporothrix brasiliensis, with the observation of lowintraspecific variation in 31 isolates (31.3%). The interval between lesion onsetand first medical visit at INI/Fiocruz, as well as treatment duration untilclinical cure, was longer in cats from the first decade of the epizootic. Inaddition, the frequency of the variables "good general status" and "presence oflymphadenomegaly" was higher among cats whose strains did not exhibitintraspecific variation. So far, S. brasiliensis has been the only speciesidentified in feline cases of sporotrichosis since the beginning of the epizooticin Rio de Janeiro at INI/Fiocruz.

LID - 10.3390/jof8070708 [doi]
AB  - Malassezia spp. are commensals of the skin, oral/sinonasal cavity, lowerrespiratory and gastrointestinal tract. Eighteen species have been recovered fromhumans, other mammals and birds. They can also be isolated from diverseenvironments, suggesting an evolutionary trajectory of adaption from anecological niche in plants and soil to the mucocutaneous ecosystem ofwarm-blooded vertebrates. In humans, dogs and cats, Malassezia-associateddermatological conditions share some commonalities. Otomycosis is common incompanion animals but is rare in humans. Systemic infections, which areincreasingly reported in humans, have yet to be recognized in animals. Malasseziaspecies have also been identified as pathogenetic contributors to some chronichuman diseases. While Malassezia species are host-adapted, some species arezoophilic and can cause fungemia, with outbreaks in neonatal intensive care wardsassociated with temporary colonization of healthcare worker's hands from contact with their pets. Although standardization is lacking, susceptibility testing isusually performed using a modified broth microdilution method. Antifungalsusceptibility can vary depending on Malassezia species, body location, infectiontype, disease duration, presence of co-morbidities and immunosuppression.Antifungal resistance mechanisms include biofilm formation, mutations oroverexpression of ERG11, overexpression of efflux pumps and gene rearrangementsor overexpression in chromosome 4.

TI  - Genetic Characterization of Microsporum canis Clinical Isolates in the UnitedStates.
LID - 676 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jof8070676 [doi]
AB  - Microsporum canis is the primary agent causing dermatophytosis in cats, and also infects humans, dogs, and other species. Assessment of genetic variation among M.canis isolates in the United States has not been conducted. Further, M. canismating type and assessment of disease severity associated with genotypiccharacteristics have not been rigorously evaluated. We therefore isolated M.canis from 191 domestic cats across the US and characterized genotypes byevaluation of ITS sequence, MAT locus, and microsatellite loci analysis. Thegenes SSU1 and SUB3, which are associated with keratin adhesion and digestion,were sequenced from a subset of isolates to evaluate potential geneticassociations with virulence. Analysis of microsatellite makers revealed three M. canis genetic clusters. Both clinic location and disease severity weresignificant predictors of microsatellite variants. 100% of the M. canis isolates were MAT1-1 mating gene type, indicating that MAT1-2 is very rare or extinct inthe US and that asexual reproduction is the dominant form of replication. Nogenetic variation at SSU1 and SUB3 was observed. These findings pave the way for novel testing modalities for M. canis and provide insights about transmission andecology of this ubiquitous and relatively uncharacterized agent.

TI  - A Survey on the Rationale Usage of Antimicrobial Agents in Small Animal Clinicsand Farms in Trinidad and Jamaica.
LID - 885 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antibiotics11070885 [doi]
AB  - The extensive and indiscriminate use of antibiotics is known to contribute toantimicrobial resistance. Unfortunately, there are no public records ofantimicrobial use (frequency or dosage) administered to animals in two majorCARICOM (Caribbean Community) countries: Trinidad and Tobago, and Jamaica.Surveillance would promote amendments and discussion on a Caribbeanantimicrobial-use protocol. In this study, an online survey was conducted usingcross-sectional qualitative interviews via email, targeting veterinary cliniciansworking in clinics and farms in Trinidad and Jamaica, to identify howantimicrobials are used in the two countries. Out of the thirty-two (32)clinicians interviewed in Trinidad, 22 (68.75%) were small animal practitioners, and 10 (45.45%) were mixed practitioners. While in Jamaica, a total of Twenty six(26) clinicians responded, of which 17 of them (65.38%) were small animalpractitioners and nine (34.62%) were mixed practitioners. A total of 95.2% ofclinics and farms in Jamaica and 87.1% in Trinidad did not use standardantimicrobial protocols, which could be due to the limited availability ofresources. The broad-spectrum antibiotic, amoxicillin, and amoxicillin/clavulanicacid were the most commonly used drugs in small animal practices in bothcountries (71.9% and 53.8% in dogs), (78.1% and 65.9% in cats); amoxicillin isalso used frequently in mixed animal practice in Jamaica (44.4% in goats, 33.3%in cattle and 22.2% in sheep and pigs), while procaine penicillin andstreptomycin was the most frequently used in mixed practice in Trinidad (60% incattle and goats, 50% in sheep), which could explain the potentially increasedrisk of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  - Hematological Parameters from the Feline Blood Donor to the Blood Unit: WhatChanges Are to Be Expected?
LID - 1819 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12141819 [doi]
AB  - Feline blood donation requires sedation to allow for good blood collection,avoiding venous damage and unnecessary donor stress. In the present study, wedescribe the variation of hematological parameters in a population of 74 healthy blood-donor cats that underwent the same sedation protocol, includingmedetomidine, alfaxalone, and butorphanol. Changes in hematological parameterswere evaluated in blood samples collected from conscious cats (group A), sedated cats (group B), and feline whole-blood units (FBUs) (group C). Significantdifferences were observed between unsedated and sedated cats: the mean RBC count,HGB, HCT, and RDW were significantly lower in sedated cats than in consciousones, with a difference of 17.95%, 18.42%, 28.21%, and 10.00%, respectively. Inaccordance with previously reported data, our results confirm that sedation is a critical procedure in cats that can affect most of the hematological parameters. The second finding of our study is that no significant differences for the mainhematological parameters were observed between sedated cats and FBUs, thussuggesting that the dilution with the conservative-anticoagulant solution exertnegligible effects on these parameters with respect to samples of sedatedanimals. This hematological change must be taken into consideration since suchparameters are important to define the quality of FBUs.

LID - 10.3390/ani12141782 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to identify the potential peptide candidates and expectedproteins associated with MYBPC3-A74T gene mutations in Bengal cats and determine if peptidome profiles differ between healthy controls and cats with MYBPC3-A74Tgene mutations. All animals were evaluated using echocardiography. DNA wasisolated and followed by the screening test of MYBPC3 gene mutation. TheMALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was conducted for analyzing the targeted peptide and protein patterns. The expected protein candidates were searched for within theNCBI database. Our results demonstrated that the MYBPC3-A74T gene mutation wasdominant in Bengal cats but not in domestic shorthair cats. Correlations between baseline characteristics and echocardiographic parameters were discovered inBengal cats. Mass spectrometry profiles of the candidate proteins were suspected to accompany the cat with the MYBPC3-A74T gene mutation, involving integralprotein-membrane, organization of nucleus, DNA replication, and ATP-bindingprotein. Therefore, MYBPC3-A74T gene mutations occur frequently in Bengal catpopulations. The high incidence of homozygotes for the mutation supports thecausal nature of the MYBPC3-A74T mutation. In addition, peptidomics analysis was established for the first time under this condition to promise a complementarytechnique for the future clinical diagnosis of the MYBPC3-A74T mutationassociated with physiological variables and cardiac morphology in cats.

LID - 10.3390/ani12141774 [doi]
AB  - Obesity is a common problem in horses. The associations between obesity andequine metabolic syndrome (EMS) and between EMS and laminitis are known. However,there is a lack of data on whether obesity itself can affect hoof lamellae.Forelimbs and blood from 12 draft horses (six obese and six lean) from aslaughterhouse were acquired. To exclude laminitis and EMS horses, insulinconcentration was measured, and hooves were radiographed. Histological evaluationwas performed. The shape of the primary and secondary epidermal lamellae (PEL andSEL) was evaluated, and the length of the keratinized and total primary epidermallamellae was measured (KPEL and TEL). All horses showed pathological changes inlamellae. In the lean group, the changes were longer SELs, more proliferated and separated PDLs, and less standard PDLs. In the obese group, the changes were alower number of club-shaped and standard SELs and significantly more taperedSELs. No difference in the shape of PELs and the length of KPELs was noticed. Theresearch did not confirm the effects of obesity on lamellar failure. Themeasurements taken indicate that the lamellae are much longer compared to otherresearch studies; this could indicate that the length of the PEL depends on thehoof size.

AB  - We studied the roaming patterns of companion cats in Denmark. The movements of 97cats with outdoor access were traced for about seven days using GPS tracking.Data on the cats were gathered from their owners. The median time cats spent awayfrom their homes was 5 h per day (IQR: 2.5 to 8.8 h), median daily distance movedwas 2.4 km (IQR: 1.3 to 3.7 km), and median for 95% BBKDE home range was 5 ha(IQR: 2.9 to 8.5 ha). Cats above seven years of age spent less time away fromhome, were less active and had a smaller home range than younger cats. Cats with access to nature areas spent more time away from home, were more active and hadlarger home ranges. Intact male cats spent more time away from home than neuteredcats and had larger home ranges as well. Finally, rainfall had an impact on thedistance moved by cats: on days without rainfall the cats moved 3.6 km on average(95% CI: 2.8; 4.5 km); and on days with heavy rainfall the cats moved 2.4 km onaverage (95% CI: 1.6; 3.5 km).

TI  - Blood Taurine Dynamics in Captive Lions: Relationship with Feed and Bile AcidComposition.
PG  - 215-223
LID - 10.1007/978-3-030-93337-1_21 [doi]
AB  - Taurine is an essential nutrient for felines including lions. Various severesymptoms induced by taurine deficiency have been reported for domestic andcaptive felines. Particularly for captive lions in zoos, little informationrelated to taurine requirements is available. Therefore, this study evaluated therelationship between blood taurine concentration and taurine content in prey feedgiven at zoos, as well as the composition, types, and conjugation properties ofbile acids (BAs) in blood collected repeatedly from four lions housed at threezoos. Blood taurine concentrations in four lions were within the normal range,although individual differences and variations were found. Taurine was abundantin feed supplied at the zoos. A positive correlation between blood taurineconcentration and feed amount was observed in lions housed at the same zoo.Approximately 70-80% of the total BA pool was cholic acid, with 50-70% beingtaurine-conjugated. Individual differences and variations were found. Nocorrelation was found between blood taurine concentration and the compositions ofBAs in the blood. Results showed that supply of taurine was sufficient for alllions fed the prey feed. Future studies must be conducted to clarify influenceson individual differences, as well as individual variations in blood taurineconcentration and blood BA composition.

TI  - Impaired Bile Acid Synthesis in a Taurine-Deficient Cat Model.
PG  - 195-203
LID - 10.1007/978-3-030-93337-1_19 [doi]
AB  - Deficiency of the functional amino acid-like compound taurine induced in cats by taurine-depleted food was previously shown to significantly decrease the levelsof taurine-conjugated bile acids (BAs) and significantly increase the levels ofunconjugated BAs, with a significant decrease in total BA concentration in thebile. Because the ratios of primary BAs (cholic acid [CA] and chenodeoxycholicacids [CDCA]) have also been shown to be altered in the bile, taurine has beensuggested to play an important role in BA synthesis in the liver. The presentstudy showed that in the liver of taurine-deficient cats, CYP7A1 proteinexpression and its metabolites (7alpha-hydroxycholesterol andalpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one) were significantly increased and, therefore, theratio of the CA product in this pathway was decreased. On the other hand, theexpression of the mitochondrial CYP27A1 protein and its metabolite27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC) were significantly decreased in thetaurine-deficient liver. Thus, a significantly decreased ratio of CDCA, which is the main product of 27HC, was found. The decreased activity of the CDCA-producingpathway might be related to mitochondrial dysfunction induced by taurinedeficiency. In addition, a significant decrease in cholesterol levels in theliver was induced by a decrease in intestinal cholesterol absorption because ofdecreased hepatic-intestinal circulation of taurine-conjugated BAs. The resultsof this study showed that taurine deficiency alters both the quality and quantityof BAs through inactivity of the mitochondrial CDCA production pathway caused by impaired mitochondrial function and inhibited the absorption of cholesterol inthe intestine.

TI  - 2022 Update of the Consensus on the Rational Use of Antithrombotics andThrombolytics in Veterinary Critical Care (CURATIVE) Domain 6: Defining rational use of thrombolytics.
PG  - 446-470
LID - 10.1111/vec.13227 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To systematically review available evidence and establish guidelines related to the use of thrombolytics for the management of small animals withsuspected or confirmed thrombosis. DESIGN: PICO (Population, Intervention,Control, and Outcome) questions were formulated, and worksheets completed as partof a standardized and systematic literature evaluation. The population ofinterest included dogs and cats (considered separately) and arterial and venousthrombosis. The interventions assessed were the use of thrombolytics, compared tono thrombolytics, with or without anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents. Specificprotocols for recombinant tissue plasminogen activator were also evaluated.Outcomes assessed included efficacy and safety. Relevant articles werecategorized according to level of evidence, quality, and as to whether theysupported, were neutral to, or opposed the PICO questions. Conclusions from thePICO worksheets were used to draft guidelines, which were subsequently refinedvia Delphi surveys undertaken by the Consensus on the Rational Use ofAntithrombotics and Thrombolytics in Veterinary Critical Care (CURATIVE) working group. RESULTS: Fourteen PICO questions were developed, generating 14 guidelines.The majority of the literature addressing the PICO questions in dogs isexperimental studies (level of evidence 3), thus providing insufficient evidence to determine if thrombolysis improves patient-centered outcomes. In cats,literature was more limited and often neutral to the PICO questions, precludingstrong evidence-based recommendations for thrombolytic use. Rather, for bothspecies, suggestions are made regarding considerations for when thrombolyticdrugs may be considered, the combination of thrombolytics with anticoagulant orantiplatelet drugs, and the choice of thrombolytic agent. CONCLUSIONS:Substantial additional research is needed to address the role of thrombolyticsfor the treatment of arterial and venous thrombosis in dogs and cats. Clinicaltrials with patient-centered outcomes will be most valuable for addressingknowledge gaps in the field.

TI  - Cardiorespiratory nematodes and co-infections with gastrointestinal parasites in new arrivals at dog and cat shelters in north-western Spain.
LID - 10.1111/tbed.14670 [doi]
AB  - Metastrongyloid and trichuroid cardiorespiratory nematodes of dogs and cats areconsidered emergent in several European countries, and an increase in the number and extent of endemic foci has been described. Since data on their prevalence is limited in this continent, faecal samples from new arrivals (365 dogs and 65cats) at two animal shelters in North-western Spain were analysed using bothfloatation and Baermann techniques. In order to confirm the microscopicidentification of Metastrongylidae first stage larvae, molecular characterizationbased on the sequence of the ITS-2 was performed. The possible influence of some variables such as the species, sex and age of the animals and the co-infectionwith other gastrointestinal parasites on the prevalence of cardiorespiratorynematodes was analysed. The most prevalent metastrongylid was Aelurostrongylusabstrusus (15.4%) followed by Angiostrongylus vasorum (4.1%) and Crenosoma vulpis(1.1%). Regarding trichuroids, Eucoleus aerophilus and/or Eucoleus boehmi eggswere detected in 28 dogs (7.7%) and four cats (6.2%). Almost all animals positiveto cardiorespiratory nematodes (86.8%) were co-infected with gastrointestinalparasites. The prevalence of Metastrongylidae and respiratory trichuroids wassignificantly higher in dogs co-infected with Taenia spp. and Toxocara canis orGiardia duodenalis and Sarcocystis spp., respectively. In cats, a significanthigher prevalence of Metastrongylidae nematodes was found in animals co-infected with Toxocara cati. Our results reveal that cardiorespiratory nematodes arecommon in companion animals from north-western Spain, showing higher prevalences than those previously reported from this country. This investigation representsthe first report of C. vulpis, E. aerophilus and E. boehmi in dogs from Spain.The identification of a number of zoonotic parasites is of public health concern.Our results indicate that these nematodes should be included in the differential diagnosis of dogs and cats from north-western Spain showing respiratory orcardiac clinical signs.

LID - 10.1016/j.isci.2022.104455 [doi]
AB  - Catnip (Nepeta cataria) and silver vine (Actinidia polygama) produce iridoidswith arthropod-repellent effects. Cats rub and roll against these plants,transferring iridoids to their fur that repels mosquitoes. Cats also lick andchew plant leaves during this response, although the benefit of this additionalbehavior has remained unknown. Here, we show that feline leaf damagesubstantially increases iridoid emission from both plants while also diversifyingiridoids in silver vine. Cats show an equivalent duration of response to thecomplex cocktail of iridoids in damaged silver vine and to the much higher level of a single iridoid produced by damaged catnip. The more complex iridoid cocktailproduced when silver vine is licked and chewed by cats increases mosquitorepellency at low concentration. In conclusion, feline leaf damage contributes byreleasing more mosquito-repellent iridoids. Feline olfactory and behavioralsensitivity is fine-tuned to plant-specific iridoid production for maximizing themosquito repellency gained.

AB  - The concentration of calprotectin in feces (fCal) is a clinically useful markerof chronic gastrointestinal inflammation in humans and dogs. No commercial assay is widely available to measure fCal in small animal medicine, to date. Thus, weverified the immunoturbidimetric fCAL turbo assay (Buhlmann) of fCal for canineand feline fecal extracts by determining linearity, spiking and recovery, andintra-assay and inter-assay variability. We determined RIs, temporal variationover 3 mo, and effect of vaccination and NSAID treatment. Observed:expected (O:E)ratios (x +/- SD) for serial dilutions of feces were 89-131% (106 +/- 9%) in dogsand 77-122% (100 +/- 12%) in cats. For spiking and recovery, the O:E ratios were 90-118% (102 +/- 11%) in dogs and 83-235% (129 +/- 42%) in cats. Intra- andinter-assay CVs for canine samples were </=19% and </=7%, and for feline samples </=22% and </=21%. Single-sample RIs were <41 mug/g for dogs and <64 mug/g forcats. With low reciprocal individuality indices, using population-based fCal RIs is appropriate, and moderate fCal changes between measurements (dogs 44.0%; cats:43.2%) are considered relevant. Cats had significant (but unlikely relevant) fCalincreases post-vaccination. Despite individual fCal spikes, no differences wereseen during NSAID treatment. The fCAL turbidimetric assay is linear, precise,reproducible, and sufficiently accurate for measuring fCal in dogs and cats.Careful interpretation of fCal concentrations is warranted in both species duringthe peri-vaccination period and for some patients receiving NSAID treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of DX and HA on hearing preservation andtissue response with cochlear implantation in a cat mode. METHODS: 11 cats werebilaterally implanted with Nurotron electrode. According to the differenttreatment, 22 ears were subdivided into four following groups: Electrode (E)only, Electrode +HA (E+H), Electrode + DX (E+DX), and Electrode +HA +DX (E+H+DX).Auditory brainstem responses (ABR) thresholds were recorded before and 3 monthsafter surgery. After 3 months of cochlear implantation histopathologicalassessment of all cochleae were performed . RESULTS: At low frequencies, the meanABR thresholds shift in animals treated with E+H+DX demonstrated a statistically significant difference. The proportion of cochleae showing fibrous tissue and newbone formation was 50% in E+H+DX group, 66.7% in E+DX group, 83.3% in E+H groupand 100% in E group. CONCLUSION: United HA and DX local delivery could providebetter protection against hearing loss at low-frequency threshold and could more effectively reduce the trauma related to electrode insertion and the fibroustissue formation around the electrode.

TI  - Effects of mechanical washing and drying on the removal of pet allergens.
LID - 10.2500/aap.2022.43.220029 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Korea, the number of households with indoor pets is rapidlyincreasing in parallel with changes in culturallifestyles. The sensitization rateof pet allergens is also increasing in Korea. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated theeffectiveness of washing machines to remove dog and cat hair and their allergens.In addition, thisstudy aimed to investigate whether only a mechanical dryerwithout mechanical washing could be used for pet allergen removal. METHOD: Webrushed cats and dogs, and thereafter collected their hair and used a residentialvacuum cleaner to obtain dust and other particulate matter from a household. The contents of the vacuum bag were sifted through a 300-mm sieve filter. Some of thecontents were placed in phosphate-buffered saline solution with 0.5% Tween 20 to make a liquid extract. Hair, dust, and liquid extract-contaminated fabric samplesafter mechanical washing or after drying without mechanical washing were analyzedfor pet allergens (Fel d l [cat], Can f 1 [dog]) by using a two-siteenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We assessed the remaining allergens in thecontaminated fabrics after mechanical drying and washing. RESULTS: The mean Fel dl and mean Can f 1 removal ratios after mechanical washing with detergent were > 99.99% for the dust, hair, and liquid extract. The removal ratios aftermechanical washing without a detergent were lower for both Fel d 1 and Can f 1,for hair, dust, and their respective liquid extracts (p < 0.05). Mechanicaldrying was just as effective as mechanical washing with detergent for removingCan f 1 but was less effective for Fel d 1 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Mechanicalwashing with detergent is important to remove pet allergens from contaminatedfabrics. If washing is difficult, then using just a dryer without washing can be an alternative method to remove allergens from contaminatedbedding or clothing.

TI  - Characterization of the Expression of Angiogenic Factors in Cutaneous SquamousCell Carcinoma of Domestic Cats.

LID - 10.3390/vetsci9070375 [doi]
AB  - Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) is a common malignant skin cancer with asignificant impact on health, and it is important to determine the degree ofreliance of CSCC on angiogenesis for growth and metastasis. Major regulators ofangiogenesis are the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family and theirassociated receptors. Alternative pre-mRNA splicing produces multiple isoforms ofVEGF-A and PLGF with distinct biological properties. Several studies highlightthe function of VEGF-A in CSCC, but there are no studies of the differentisoforms of VEGF-A and PLGF for this neoplasm. We characterized the expression ofthree isoforms of VEGF-A, two isoforms of PLGF, and their receptors in cat CSCCbiopsies compared to normal haired skin (NHS). Although our results revealed nosignificant changes in transcript levels of panVEGF-A or their isoforms, the mRNAlevels of PLGF I and the receptors Flt-1 and KDR were downregulated in CSCCcompared to NHS. Differences were observed in ligand:receptor mRNA expressionratio, with the expression of VEGF-A relative to its receptor KDR higher in CSCC,which is consistent with our hypothesis and prior human SCC studies.Immunolocalization in tissue showed increased expression of all measured factors and receptors in tumor cells compared to NHS and surrounding vasculature. Weconclude that the factors measured may play a pivotal role in CSCC growth,although further studies are needed to clarify the role of angiogenic factors in feline CSCC.

LID - 10.3390/vetsci9070369 [doi]
AB  - The restrictive measures implemented to stem the spread of COVID-19 abruptlychanged the lives of many cats and their owners. This study explored whether the lockdown in Italy affected the cat-owner relationship, as well as cat behaviourand welfare. A survey that included questions on owner and cat's demographics,living environment, cat behaviour and a modified version of the Cat/DogRelationship Scale (C/DORS) was distributed online during the lockdown and wascompleted by 548 cat owners, mainly women (81.6%). With regard to the C/DORSsubscales, both emotional closeness and cat-owner interactions increased duringconfinement, as opposed to a reduction in perceived costs. The effect of the typeof job, family role and owner's age on the C/DORS scores suggests that therelationship improved for those owners that, due to the lockdown, increased thetime spent with their cats. For 58.8% of respondents, their cat's generalbehaviour did not change, but when changes occurred, they were mostly positive(20.4%). Attention-seeking and demanding behaviours were the most increasedduring lockdown (25.7%). Cats with pre-existing problematic behaviours tended to either remain stable or improve during confinement. The overall positive effects of lockdown-related environmental changes on a cat's behaviour suggest that some aspects of commonly implemented cat management practices should be revised toimprove cat welfare in normal circumstances.

LID - 10.3390/vetsci9070363 [doi]
AB  - The close contact between humans and domestic cats raises concerns about thepotential risks of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Thus, this study aims to investigate anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in client-owned cats from Portugal and evaluatethe infection risk of cats that maintain contact with human COVID-19 cases. Atotal of 176 cats, belonging to 94 households, were sampled. Cat owners answered an online questionnaire, and cats were screened for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2using a commercial ELISA. Twenty (21.3%) households reported at least oneconfirmed human COVID-19 case. Forty cats (22.7%) belonged to a COVID-19-positiveand 136 (77.3%) to a COVID-19-negative household. The seroprevalences of catsfrom COVID-19-positive and -negative households were 5.0% (2/40) and 0.7%(1/136). The two SARS-CoV-2-seropositive cats from COVID-19-positive householdshad an indoor lifestyle, and their owners stated that they maintained a close andfrequent contact with them, even after being diagnosed with COVID-19, pointingtowards human-to-cat transmission. The SARS-CoV-2-seropositive cat from theCOVID-19-negative household had a mixed indoor/outdoor lifestyle and chronicdiseases. Owners of the three SARS-CoV-2-seropositive cats did not noticeclinical signs or behavior changes. This study highlights the low risk ofSARS-CoV-2 transmission from COVID-19-positive human household members todomestic cats, even in a context of close and frequent human-animal contact.

LID - 10.3390/vetsci9070337 [doi]
AB  - Bartonellosis and haemoplasmosis are vector-borne diseases with global impact on the health of domestic cats and of zoonotic importance. The aim of this study wasto describe the epidemiological aspects of various populations of cats infectedwith Bartonella spp. or haemoplasma species. The populations evaluated includedclient-owned cats, stray cats and cats that live in breeding catteries in Greece.A total of 452 cats were prospectively enrolled into the study. A commerciallyavailable indirect immunofluorescence antibody testkit was used for the detectionof Bartonella henselae IgG antibodies in serum. PCRs for the detection ofBartonella spp. and haemoplasma species DNA in the blood were also performed in asubgroup of 242 of the 452 cats. Risk factors for B. henselae seropositivity and infection with the haemoplasma species were determined using multivariableanalysis. Overall, 160 (35.4%) of the 452 cats were seropositive for B. henselae.Seven (2.9%) and 46 (19%) of the 242 cats were PCR-positive for Bartonella spp.and haemoplasma species, respectively. The factors associated with B. henselaeseropositivity, based on multivariate analysis, included older age, outdooraccess, living region and flea infestation. Non-administration ofectoparasiticides was associated with haemoplasma species infection. This studyshows a high prevalence of seropositivity for B. henselae and a relatively highprevalence of infection with haemoplasma species. Therefore, it is necessary toestablish optimal strategies for the prevention of Bartonella spp. andhaemoplasma species infections, considering the high-risk groups of catsidentified in this study.

TI  - Successful Treatment of Vertebral Osteosarcoma in a Cat Using Marginal SurgicalExcision and Chemotherapy.
LID - 315 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vetsci9070315 [doi]
AB  - A three-year-old male neutered Norwegian Forest cat was referred for bilateralambulatory paraparesis and spinal pain. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), amass involving the right epaxial muscles with vertebral canal invasion andcausing marked extradural spinal cord compression was identified. At surgery, themass was debulked and a right hemilaminectomy was performed. Histopathology wasdiagnostic of fibroblastic osteosarcoma. Residual osteolytic lesions of theosteosarcoma were present at the level of the spinous process of the secondlumbar vertebra. Four cycles of adjuvant doxorubicin chemotherapy wereadministered followed by oral toceranib phosphate. Neurological signs improvedgradually over weeks to months and the lesion in the spinous process was nolonger visible on radiographs. At one year from diagnosis, an MRI of the T3-L3(3rd thoracic vertebra to the 3rd lumbar vertebra) spinal region and a whole-bodycomputer tomography (CT) scan found no evidence of the osteosarcoma in the spine or of any metastasis. All medications were stopped and, at the time of writing 16months later, the patient is neurologically normal with no signs of cancerrecurrence. This is the first case report documenting the complete resolution of vertebral osteosarcoma lesions after treatment with doxorubicin followed bytoceranib phosphate. The treatment also prevented tumor recurrence and wasassociated with an exceptionally long-term survival time.

TI  - Influence of Gallic Acid-Containing Mouth Spray on Dental Health and OralMicrobiota of Healthy Cats-A Pilot Study.
LID - 313 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vetsci9070313 [doi]
AB  - This pilot study aimed to investigate the effects of gallic acid-containing mouthspray on oral microbiota in healthy cat subjects. Forty healthy cats wererecruited and randomly allocated to the control (G1; n = 20) and treatment groups(G2; n = 20). The cats were treated with mouth spray twice daily for 42 days. Thechanges in the gingival index (GI) and plaque index (PI) were measured atbaseline (day 0) and end of the study (42nd day). The changes in the oralmicrobial composition of representative animals (control, n = 9; and treatment, n= 8) were also evaluated at baseline and end of the study. Oral microbialcomposition was assessed by amplifying the V1-V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene fromsupragingival dental plaque DNA extracts. The sequences were annotated using the QIIME 2.0. The GI and PI were significantly reduced after 42 days of treatment.The deep sequencing revealed that mouth spray influenced the cats' oralmicrobiome and was significantly diverse. About 20 phyla and 59 species wereobserved after 42 days of mouth spray usage in cats' oral microbiota. The number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of post-treatment samples (PoTS) of G2 was greatly reduced compared to other samples. Further analysis revealed that mouthspray acts substantially against Desulfomicrobium orale, one of the knownpathogens in periodontal disease. The mouth spray efficiently reduced the growth of 22 species and uprooted 17 species. Moreover, the mouth spray supported thegrowth of normal oral microbiota, including Moraxella and Neisseria species. The preliminary study suggested that the gallic acids-containing mouth spray could bean essential oral product to improve the oral hygiene of the cats. Moreover,further studies are needed to confirm the beneficial effect of mouth spray oncats.

TI  - Piroplasmid infection is not associated with clinicopathological and laboratoryabnormalities in cats from Midwestern Brazil.
LID - 10.1007/s00436-022-07602-8 [doi]
AB  - Feline piroplasmids include the genera Babesia spp., Cytauxzoon spp., andTheileria spp. In Brazil, there are few reports regarding these hemoprotozoans;however, clinicopathological and molecular data are scarce. This study aimed tocharacterize the clinical relevance of these parasites through hematological,biochemical, and molecular approaches. For this purpose, 166 cats from Brasilia, Federal District, Midwestern Brazil, were screened using a quantitativepolymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for piroplasmids based on the LSU4 mitochondrialgene, which resulted in an overall prevalence of 36/166 (21.7%). Twelve of 166samples (7.2%) were positive for C. felis, while 19/166 (11.4%) were positive forBabesia vogeli. No samples tested positive for Theileria spp. Babesia vogeli and Cytauxzoon spp. LSU4 sequences showed identities of 97-100% and 99.3%,respectively, to US isolates. The hematological and biochemical findings did not differ significantly between the cats that tested positive and negative forpiroplasmids. Although the lack of abnormalities in clinical and laboratoryparameters does not eliminate the possibility that these cats were sick andrecovered, it may suggest that the Brazilian strain of Cytauxzoon spp. is not as pathogenic as that from the USA, despite the high molecular identity with NorthAmerican isolates.

TI  - Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) Are Copurified with Feline Calicivirus, yetEV-Enriched Fractions Remain Infectious.

AB  - Feline calicivirus (FCV) is a major cause of upper respiratory disease in catsand is often used as a model for human norovirus, making it of great veterinaryand human medical importance. However, questions remain regarding the route ofentry of FCV in vivo. Increasing work has shown that extracellular vesicles (EVs)can be active in viral infectivity, yet there is no work examining the role ofEVs in FCV infection. Here, we begin to address this knowledge gap bycharacterizing EVs produced by a feline mammary epithelial cell line (FMEC). Wehave confirmed that EVs are produced by infected and mock-infected FMECs and thatboth virions and EVs are coisolated with standard methods of virus purification. We also show that they can be enriched differentially by continuous iodixanoldensity gradient. EVs were enriched at a density of 1.10 g/mL confirmed bytetraspanin expression, size profile, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).Maximum enrichment of FCV at a density of 1.18 g/mL was confirmed by titration,quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (q-RT PCR), and TEM. However, infectiousvirus was recovered from nearly all samples. When used to infect in vitroepithelium, both EV-rich and virus-rich fractions had the same levels ofinfectiousness as determined by percentage of wells infected or titer achievedpostinfection. These findings highlight the importance of coisolates during viralpurification, showing that EVs may represent a parallel route of entry that haspreviously been overlooked. Additional experiments are necessary to explore therole of EVs in FCV infection. IMPORTANCE Feline calicivirus (FCV) is a commoncause of upper respiratory infection in cats. Both healthy and infected cellsproduce small particles called extracellular vesicles (EVs), which arenanoparticles that act as messengers between cells and can be hijacked duringviral infection. Historically, the role of EVs in viral infection has beenoverlooked, and subsequently no group has studied the role of EVs in FCVinfection. We hypothesized that EVs may play a role in FCV infection. Here, weshow that EVs are copurified with FCV when collecting virus. To study theirindividual effects, we successfully enrich for viral particles and EVs separatelyby taking advantage of their different densities. Our initial studies show thatEV-enriched versus virus-enriched fractions are equally able to infect cells inculture. These findings highlight the need to both consider the purity of virusafter purification and to further study EVs' role in natural FCV infection.

AB  - Small-scale evolution or microevolution concerns evolution at the intra-specific level or between closely related species. At the intra-specific level, it allows the analysis of the evolutionary forces at work: mutation, genetic drift,migration and selection. Moreover, because of the short evolutionary time, it is easier to identify the genetic basis of observed phenotypic differences. Moststudies focus on current populations but more and more analyses are performed on ancient DNA. This provides important information for tracing the history ofpopulations and also allows the reconstruction of phenotypes of individuals that disappeared several thousand years ago. In this short review, I present studiesshowing how pre-zygotic or post-zygotic barriers involved in species formationare set up using the example of the geographical barrier due to the formation of the Isthmus of Panama and that of the heterochromatin divergence inDrosophilidae. I also describe the different approaches that have been used toidentify the genetic basis of well known phenotypic variations: candidate geneapproach (about melanism in felines), QTL mapping (variation in the number oflateral bone plates in sticklebacks), association study (pigmentation in theAsian ladybird). Finally, I illustrate the key impact of natural selection withthe iconic example of the evolution of the beak of Galapagos finches, and therole of certain developmental genes in its morphological diversification.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate owners' chronic medication adherence for management offeline cardiovascular disease in the small animal referral setting. ANIMALS,MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire-based study of owners at fivemulti-specialty, small animal referral centers was conducted. Owners completed a written survey evaluating demographics, degree of medication adherence, anddifficulties encountered for medication adherence. Owners were free to declineparticipation in the study. RESULTS: Fifty-four questionnaires were available forreview. The most common diagnosis was hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (n = 31,57.4%). Clopidogrel was the most cited medication that was difficult toadminister consistently (n = 13, 24.0%), although 20 owners (37.0%) reported nodifficulty consistently administering medications. "Taste of medication" (n = 14,25.9%) was the most reported reason for difficulty medicating their cat, and mostowners (n = 36, 66.7%) stated twice daily was the highest frequency of heartmedications they feel they can consistently administer. Fifty owners (92.6%) met the criteria for medication adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic medication adherence in this study population was high. Clopidogrel was the most difficult medication to consistently administer, and twice a day dosing was the highest frequency ofmedication administration most owners could achieve. Cardiologists should beaware of these factors when determining optimal treatment protocols for themanagement of cardiovascular disease in cats.

AB  - Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is a zoonotic intracellular protozoan parasite thatcan invade, replicate and survive in almost all cells of warm-blooded animals. T.gondii infection threatens the life of the fetus or can cause morbidity in theinfant. As the only definitive host of T. gondii, felids spread the pathogenmainly by forming oocysts in the small intestines and discharging the oocystsinto the ambient environment, consequently polluting water, vegetables, and meat products. In this study, we used untargeted metabolomics technology to study the changes in metabolites that occurred during the early stage of oocyst formationin the cat small intestine following T. gondii infection and attempted toidentify metabolic biomarkers that could potentially be used as diagnosticmolecular markers in the future. Domestic cats (Felis catus) were infected withT. gondii Pru tissue cysts, and samples of their small intestinal epithelium werecollected at 2 and 4 days post-infection (DPI) for metabolic analysis. LC-MS/MSand multivariate statistical analysis were employed to detect metabolomicsignatures that discriminated between the infected and control groups. A total of1673 ions and 1201 ions were obtained in the positive and negative modes,respectively. Of these ions, 175 were up-regulated and 127 were down-regulated inthe positive ion mode; whereas, 123 were up-regulated and 81 were down-regulated in the negative ion mode. Three commonly altered ions (0.74_313.0414 m/z,8.82_615.2621 m/z and 8.16_325.2362 m/z) were determined to have potentialresearch value. Seventy common metabolic pathways were enriched at two timepoints, with arginine biosynthesis, pyrimidine metabolism, pantothenate and CoAbiosynthesis being the three most significant pathways related to T. gondii. The area under the curve (AUC) of differential metabolites combined with relevantliterature analysis showed that N-Methylpelletierine and3,3-Difluoro-17-methyl-5alpha-androstan-17beta-ol have higher predictability and better potential application value than other metabolites. Our analysis ofmetabolic markers during the early stage of T. gondii oocyst formation in thesmall intestine of the definitive host (cat) provided novel insight forunderstanding oocyst development and a theoretical basis for the application ofpotential biomarkers.

TI  - Naturally acquired feline bocavirus type 1 and 3 infections in cats withneurologic deficits.
LID - 10.1111/tbed.14664 [doi]
AB  - Feline bocaviruses (FBoVs) have been recognized as novel feline pathogensassociated with gastrointestinal diseases. Although bocavirus infections inhumans and animals present a broad range of clinical symptoms includingneurologic diseases, the neuropathology caused by FBoV infection in cats isunknown. This study aims to investigate the presence of bocavirus in the brainsamples of 78 cats showing neurologic deficits and 41 healthy cats usingpolymerase chain reaction (PCR) and to present the pathological findings of FBoV infection in brain tissues. Only five (6.41%, five out of 78) cats withneurological deficit were FBoV positive on PCR screening and were characterizedas FBoV-1 (four out of five) and FBoV-3 (one out of five) by sequencing. AmongFBoV-positive cases, viral DNA were detected by PCR in the cerebrum and brainstem of all FBoV-positive cases and rarely detected in the cerebellum of somecases. Histologically, all FBoV-positive cases revealed a variety of inflammatoryresponses. Among these, 80% (four out of five cases) showed multifocal neuronalvacuolation, mainly found in the cerebrum and brain stem. Eosinophilicinclusion-like materials were found within the nuclei of glial cells in theFBoV-3-positive case. In situ hybridization revealed FBoV DNA in oligodendroglia and vacuolated neurons detected using dual labelling with Olig-2 and NeuNimmunohistochemistry, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy confirmedthe presence of FBoV-3 virions in the nuclei of glial cells. Apart fromlocalization in brain tissues, the FBoV DNA were also detected in multiple lymph nodes (five out of five) and some intestines (two out of five) of such positivecases, suggesting both parenteral and enteral infections. Complete genomesequence analysis revealed genetic diversity of detected FBoV-1, which wereclosely related to the strains found in China and Hong Kong, while the detectedFBoV-3 presented distant monophyletic clade to previously detected FBoV-3sequences. The FBoVs, together, should be considered a neurotropic virus and apossible cause for neuronal vacuolation in cats with neurologic deficits.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Data on sensorineural deafness (CSD) in purebred white client-ownedcats is limited as most of the information on this disease entity is assured frommixed-breed experimental colonies. It is known that cats with blue irises aremore predisposed to CSD having been described as a condition in which manystructures in the inner ear are damaged resulting in hearing loss. Cats with CSD are born deaf or lose their hearing irreversibly within the first 4-5 weeks oflife. It is important to diagnose cats with this hereditary condition in order toeliminate affected individuals from breeding. The objectives of this study wereto ensure data on prevalence of CSD in a population of 72 client-owned purebredwhite cats in Poland according to the color of the irises and to determine ifthere are any predispositions with regard to CSD among different breeds of catsin which the dominant W gene is present. RESULTS: Conducted study included 72purebred white cats from six different breeds. The prevalence of CSD in theconducted study was 16.7%, CI95 [8.9%; 23.3%]. Unilateral deafness (11.1%, CI95[4.9%; 20.7%]) was more common than bilateral CSD (5.6%, CI95 [1.5%; 13.6%]). Thestudies did not show any association between sex and CSD, p = .46. No associationbetween the blue color of irises and deafness in the studied population could be found, p = .91. When compared to the rest of the examined population, noassociation was found between CSD and a particular breed. CONCLUSIONS: Overallprevalence of CSD regarding the examined population of purebred client-owned catswas reported as lower when compared to previous studies concerning purebred cats.Cats with blue irises are more likely to be deaf in accordance to the currentstate of knowledge, however in the conducted study, no significant associationbetween the presence of blue irises and deafness in white purebred cats could be identified. In order to eliminate CSD from the population, it is necessary toconduct examinations and diagnose CSD in white cats with blue irises as well aswith irises of color other than blue. Association between particular breed andCSD wasn't identified.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Oral medication of small animals, particularly cats, is oftenchallenging. The transdermal route may provide an easier option for owners toadminister chronic treatment. Tramadol is an analgesic mainly used in humans; it is also commonly used in dogs, despite some controversy over its clinicalefficacy. Recent studies have suggested that tramadol is efficacious for painmanagement in cats. In cats, the inner pinna is the most commonly used site fortransdermal drug therapy; the use of this site has been validated in experimentalstudies of methimazole and mirtazapine treatment. This ex vivo study aimed tocharacterise the percutaneous absorption pharmacokinetics of a formulation oftramadol in Pentravan through feline inner pinna skin. METHODS: High-performance liquid chromatography was used to assess the stability of the tramadolformulation (100 mg/ml in Pentravan) over three months at room temperature.Forced degradation was also assessed in neutral, acidic, alkaline, and oxidative conditions. A Franz cell system was employed to evaluate percutaneous absorption of a finite dose of tramadol. RESULTS: The tramadol formulation was stable forthree months at room temperature. Tramadol penetrated through ex vivo felineinner pinna skin, but considerable intra- and inter-individual variability inkinetics was observed. Comparison with another vehicle, Lipoderm, revealed nosignificant difference in the percutaneous absorption of tramadol. CONCLUSIONSAND RELEVANCE: The Pentravan formulation assessed in this study supportedtramadol absorption across the feline inner ear skin. In vivo studies arenecessary to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of this formulation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Biological sex differences in cancer are increasingly acknowledged.Here, we examined these differences in clinicopathological characteristics andsurvival in microsatellite instability (MSI)-high and microsatellite stable (MSS)gastric cancer (GC). DESIGN: We analysed MSI status by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or mismatch repair (MMR) status by immunohistochemistry in a pooledanalysis of individual patient data from one retrospective cohort from Cologne,and the randomised phase III clinical trials D1/D2 and CRITICS. All patients had resectable adenocarcinoma of the stomach and/or gastro-oesophageal junction.Patients were treated with either surgery only or perioperativechemo(radio)therapy. RESULTS: MSI and/or MMR analyses on 1307 tumours resulted in1192 (91.2%) MSS and/or MMR proficient (MMRP) [median age, 65 years; 759 males(63.7%); 619 treated with surgery only (51.9%)], and 115 (8.8%) MSI-high [median age, 69 years; 67 males (58.3%); 76 treated with surgery only (66.1%)] GC cases. Males had shorter overall survival (OS) than female MSI-high GC (5-year OS 34.7% vs. 69.7%; hazard ratio (HR) 2.68, 95%CI 1.60 to 4.49; p < 0.001). Females withMSI-high had longer OS than those with MSS/MMRP GC (HR 0.61, 95%CI 0.41 to 0.92; p = 0.02). Males with MSI-high did not have longer OS than those with MSS/MMRP GC(HR 1.26, 95%CI 0.94 to 1.69; p = 0.12). CONCLUSIONS: MSI-high GC males had asignificantly worse prognosis compared to their female counterparts in threeindependent cohorts. In addition, the favourable prognostic value of MSI was onlyseen in females and not in males. These observations emphasise the need toconsider sex differences in prognosis and treatment effects in oncology. CLINICALTRIAL REGISTRATION: The CRITICS trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, numberNCT00407186; EudraCT, number 2006-004130-32; and CKTO, 2006-02.

LID - 10.24425/pjvs.2022.141819 [doi]
AB  - Basic lung and heart ultrasound examination combined with chest X-ray (TUSX) iscurrently considered to be very useful for differentiation of asthma, chronicbronchitis and laryngeal paralysis from other diseases with dyspnea/coughing.Among 252 client-owned animals with persistent dyspnea/cough/noisy breathing, in 197 of them: pulmonary edema, pneumonia, lung cancer, free pleural fluid,pneumothorax, lung contusion or heart disease were diagnosed. The remaining 55animals (42 dogs and 13 cats) were diagnosed with asthma (in 13 cats), chronicbronchitis (in 37 dogs) and laryngeal paralysis (in 5 dogs) using TUSX. Theseanimals were qualified for inhaled fluticasone treatment using 3 types of spacers- two commercial and a home- -made mask. 36 animals (65.5%) completed the trail. In 26 of them (72.2%) the owners observed complete, long lasting relief of thesymptoms, and the owners of 7 animals (19.5%) declared a considerable clinicalimprovement, regardless of the type of spacer used. The owners of 3 animals(8.3%) did not see any improvement. The proposed diagnostic and therapeuticmanagement improved long-term clinical status of the vast majority (91.7%) ofanimals. Therefore, it seems justified to include the TUSX diagnostic protocol indaily veterinary practice and to encourage owners to prepare home-made face masksfor inhaled fluticasone treatment.

LID - 10.1111/vsu.13862 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility of laparoscopic vertical sleevegastrectomy (LVSG) in feline cadavers using endoscopic stapling equipment andreport clinical outcomes in two live feline subjects. STUDY DESIGN: Cadavericstudy and experimental case series. ANIMALS: Ten feline cadavers; two felinesubjects. METHODS: LVSG technique was refined on feline cadavers and includedretraction of the liver, dissection of the stomach, assessment of proper locationfor gastrectomy via stapling, and leak testing. Appropriateness of gastrectomy,gastrectomy %, surgical times and complications were recorded. The procedure was performed on two live feline subjects, and they were followed for 4 months toreport surgical complications. RESULTS: LVSG was completed in 9/10 cadavers andboth live patients. Stenosis at the incisura was recorded in 2/9 cadavers. Noobvious leaks were seen in the 8 cadavers that were tested or either livepatient. The mean surgical time for all cadaver procedures and live patients was 110.4 and 115 minutes, respectively. Mean weight of resected cadaver stomach was 10 g and the mean % of the total stomach weight resected was 27.6%. No intra- or postoperative surgical complications occurred in the live subjects. CONCLUSION:LVSG technique appears feasible and safe for use in live patients. CLINICALRELEVANCE: This LVSG technique may be safely used for partial gastric resectionin cats. Further studies are necessary to determine if it is effective atreversing the effects of obesity and diabetes in this population.

TI  - Surgical Treatment and Outcome of Acquired Midline Palate Defects in Cats.
PG  - 922047
LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.922047 [doi]
AB  - Acquired midline palate defects (PDE) affect the hard palate and/or soft palate, and result from trauma, commonly falling from a height or being hit by a motorvehicle. Additional life-threating injuries and costs associated with thetreatment may delay the surgical treatment. This retrospective study describessignalment, cause, and extent of the PDE, and treatment in 25 cats. In addition, the outcome of the surgical repair is described in 19 (76%) cats. All defectswere repaired within 5 days of the injury. Twenty (80%) cats were 4 years of age or younger. The most common rostral extent of the PDE was to the level of thethird premolar tooth (n = 8; 32%), incisor teeth (n = 7; 28%), and fourthpremolar tooth (n = 5; 20%). The soft palate laceration was present in all cases.Surgical therapy was successful in all cases with follow-up. The most commontechniques used for the closure of the hard palate defect were bilateral pedicle flaps with lateral releasing incisions (n = 8; 32%), direct apposition of theoral mucosa (n = 7; 28%), bilateral pedicle flaps with lateral releasingincisions and interquadrant splinting (n = 5; 20%), and unilateral pedicle flapwith one lateral releasing incision (n = 4; 16%). A tension-free closure bydirect apposition of the edges was possible for the soft palate laceration. Nooronasal fistulae were identified at follow-up. The only complication wasmalocclusion. The interquadrant splinting was most often used for PDE extendingto the rostral portion of the hard palate (p < 0.05). The cats that sufferedpostoperative malocclusion were significantly more likely to have sustainedtemporomandibular joint injury, underwent CT scan, or had a feeding tube placedbefore discharge. The results of this retrospective study indicate that the earlytreatment (within 5 days) of the acquired longitudinal defects in the midline of the hard and soft palates is highly successful.

TI  - Effect of Dietary Methylsulfonylmethane Supplementation on Growth Performance,Hair Quality, Fecal Microbiota, and Metabolome in Ragdoll Kittens.
PG  - 838164
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.838164 [doi]
AB  - Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) is a natural sulfur-containing organic substance thathas many biological functions, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, skinnourishing, and hair growth-promoting effects. This study was conducted todetermine the effect of MSM supplementation on growth performance, antioxidantcapacity, and hair quality in kittens. A total of 21 Ragdoll kittens wereassigned to three diets by initial body weight and gender: basal dietsupplemented with 0%, 0.2%, and 0.4% MSM (CON, LMSM, and HMSM groups) for 65days. During the whole period, the food intake of kittens in the MSM-treatedgroups tended to be higher (P < 0.10) compared with the CON group, and theaverage daily gain (ADG) had no significant difference when compared to thekittens in the CON group (P > 0.05). Antioxidant capacity had no significantdifference (P > 0.05) among the groups. The scale thickness of hair tended to be smaller in the LMSM group compared to the CON group (P < 0.10) and decreasedsignificantly (P < 0.05) over time from d 0 to d 65 in the LMSM group, indicatingthe improvement of hair quality. Besides, supplementation with LMSM increasedbacterial diversity. Kittens fed MSM had no significant differences in fecalgenus at the end of the study. No significant differences in fecal short-chainfatty acids were observed among groups. Fecal metabolomics analysis furtherrevealed that MSM hardly affected the metabolites. Overall, dietarysupplementation with 0.2% MSM can improve the hair quality of kittens.Furthermore, 0.2 approximately 0.4% of MSM had no detrimental effects on serumbiochemistry, growth performance, gut microbiota, and metabolome, which supports the safety inclusion of MSM to a certain degree in feline diets. To the best ofour knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the effects of MSMsupplementation in cats.

AB  - The aim of this study was to characterize Leishmania spp. from canine and feline samples using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)- Restriction Fragment LengthPolymorphism (RFLP). It was conducted in the southern region of Brazil, locatedat border crossings to Argentina and Uruguay. Samples were collected from 116dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) and 89 cats (Felis catus). The PCR was performed toscreen for an LT1 fragment from kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) target gene, and positive samples were subjected to a second PCR for an internal transcribed spacers (ITS1)region from ribosomal DNA (rDNA) target. RFLP was performed using the Haemophilusaegyptius (HAE III) restriction endonuclease (Fermentas (R)). Positive samples byPCR ITS1 were sequenced and deposited in NCBI GenBank, and a phylogeneticanalysis was developed. We found that 12.9% (15/116) of the samples from dogswere positive. All the 89 cat samples were negative. Positive samples were testedagainst Leishmania reference strains presenting different patterns in PCR-RFLP,and these samples showed bands denoting similarity to the standard species ofLeishmania infantum, proven through sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. TheRFLP technique, alone, was shown to be feasible for practical application andconfirmation of the involved Leishmania spp.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0270067 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at thepost-transcriptional level. miRNAs have been found in urine and have showndiagnostic potential in human nephropathies. Here, we aimed to characterize, for the first time, the feline urinary miRNAome and explore the use of urinary miRNA profiles as non-invasive biomarkers for feline pyelonephritis (PN). Thirty-eight cats were included in a prospective case-control study and classified in fivegroups: healthy Control cats (n = 11), cats with PN (n = 10), cats withsubclinical bacteriuria or cystitis (SB/C, n = 5), cats with ureteral obstruction(n = 7) and cats with chronic kidney disease (n = 5). By small RNA sequencing we identified 212 miRNAs in cat urine, including annotated (n = 137) and putativenovel (n = 75) miRNAs. The 15 most highly abundant urinary miRNAs accounted fornearly 71% of all detected miRNAs, most of which were previously identified infeline kidney. Ninety-nine differentially abundant (DA) miRNAs were identifiedwhen comparing Control cats to cats with urological conditions and 102 DA miRNAs when comparing PN to other urological conditions. Tissue clustering analysisrevealed that the majority of urine samples clustered close to kidney, whichconfirm the likely cellular origin of the secreted urinary miRNAs. Relevant DAmiRNAs were verified by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Eighteen miRNAsdiscriminated Control cats from cats with a urological condition. Of those, sevenmiRNAs were DA by both RNAseq and qPCR methods between Control and PN cats(miR-125b-5p, miR-27a-3p, miR-21-5p, miR-27b-3p, miR-125a-5p, miR-17-5p andmiR-23a-3p) or DA between Control and SB/C cats (miR-125b-5p). Six additionalmiRNAs (miR-30b-5p, miR-30c, miR-30e-5p, miR-27a-3p, miR-27b-39 and miR-222)relevant for discriminating PN from other urological conditions were identifiedby qPCR alone (n = 4) or by both methods (n = 2) (P<0.05). This panel of 13miRNAs has potential as non-invasive urinary biomarkers for diagnostic of PN and other urological conditions in cats.

PG  - e51
LID - 10.1017/S0022149X22000451 [doi]
AB  - The influence of climate on parasite distribution has been demonstrated indifferent regions worldwide. Despite its small size, Gran Canaria (CanaryIslands, Spain) constitutes a 'biodiversity laboratory' due to the huge climatic differences between municipalities. Feral cats may represent a threat tobiodiversity due to their predatory behaviour. In addition, they may be a source of pathogens zoonotic to humans. To study the climatic/seasonal influence andprevalence of feral cat parasites throughout the island, a total of 290 stoolsamples from 29 feral cat colonies were analysed following standard concentrationprotocols (sodium chloride, formol-ether and zinc sulphate). In total, 13 feline parasitic taxa were found, with the most common species being Ancylostoma spp.,which, together with Toxocara spp., Toxoplasma gondii and Giardia spp., areconsidered a concern for human health. Nematodes were the most common parasitesin all areas. Nematodes and protozoans were significantly more prevalent intemperate mild (75.0% and 30.0%) than in dry desert areas (29.3% and 18.7%). Incontrast, cestodes were significantly more prevalent in dry desert than intemperate mild areas (26.0% and 13.3%). Only protozoans exhibited statisticallysignificant seasonal patterns, mostly in the wet season. Data reported in thisstudy endorse the usage of small and diverse islands such as Gran Canaria tostudy the climatic influence on parasitic communities in wild/feral animals. Cat colonies require better management to reduce their threat to endemic wildlife,domestic animals and public health, being invasive species that harbour zoonotic parasites.

AB  - Introduction: awareness and knowledge of toxoplasmosis are particularlyimportant, as an intervention point for the management of the disease. The aim ofthis study was to evaluate the awareness and knowledge regarding toxoplasmosis ina sample of postpartum Moroccan women. Methods: this was a cross-sectionaldescriptive survey carried out among 320 parturient at the National ReferenceCenter for Neonatology and Nutrition at the Children's Hospital of Rabat.Results: of 320 parturient women responding to the survey, 227 (71%) had neverheard about toxoplasmosis. While 18.1% of parturient stated knowing thetransmission routes for toxoplasmosis. Regarding the transmission route, 53(16.6%) women pointed at a domestic cat and 31 (9.7%) at eating raw orundercooked meat. Out of all participants, 60 (18.8%) women said they hadreceived prevention advice during their pregnancy. The great majority (90%) ofparticipants were unaware of the severity of the congenital infection. None ofthe participants showed a high level of knowledge about transmission routes,measures of prevention, and severity of CT. Conclusion: according to our survey, we observed that the majority of participants had never heard any informationabout toxoplasmosis. It is, therefore, necessary to educate women of childbearingage and pregnant women about the disease, especially concerning the transmission route and the prevention of infection and primary infection in non-immune women.

TI  - Generalized and fatal felid alphaherpesvirus-1 natural infection with liverinvolvement in a feline leukaemia virus-positive adult cat: a case report.
LID - 10.1007/s11259-022-09977-6 [doi]
AB  - Generalized and fatal felid alphaherpesvirus-1 (FeHV-1) natural infection withliver involvement is rarely reported in cats, and the occurrence of herpesvirusviraemia with internal organ histologic lesions in adult cats is unknown. A1.5-year-old cat, female, mixed breed, positive for feline leukaemia virus (FeLV)presented in a veterinary teaching hospital with sneezing, nasal discharge,anorexia, and diarrhoea after two weeks, evolving to inspiratory dyspnoea.Complete blood count and serum biochemistry analysis showed marked leukopenia andthrombocytopenia. After clinical worsening and lack of treatment response, thecat was euthanized. Pathological findings included hepatic necrosis,fibrinonecrotic tracheitis, and bronchointerstitial pneumonia. Marked amounts of coccobacillary bacteria were observed covering the necrotic tracheal andbronchial mucosa, at the cytoplasm of alveolar macrophages, and free in alveolilumen, mimicking a primary bacterial tracheitis and pneumonia. Both lung andtracheal bacteria exhibited marked immunolabeling in anti-Escherichia coliimmunohistochemistry. In addition, rare epithelial cells of bronchi containedround, eosinophilic, intranuclear viral inclusion bodies (4-7 microm) thatmarginate the chromatin, characteristic of FeHV-1 infection. Strong multifocalanti-FeHV-1 immunolabeling was observed in necrotic epithelial cells of theliver, trachea, and lungs. Generalized herpesvirus infection with the occurrence of acute hepatic necrosis and severe respiratory illness is a potentialdifferential diagnosis in FeLV-positive cats with respiratory signs. Theimmunodepression in these cats probably favours a FeHV-1 viraemia in addition to the development of opportunistic bacterial infections, such as Escherichia coli, and it is associated with a poor outcome.

AB  - This study investigated the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility ofenterococci isolated from dogs and cats with urinary tract infections innorthwestern Croatia. During this study, the laboratory received 787 urinesamples, 651 from dogs and 136 from cats. A total of 260 urine samples (211 from dogs and 49 from cats) were bacteriologically positive. Of these, 29 isolatesbelonged to Enterococcus spp.; 22 from dogs and seven from cats. Enterococciisolates were identified by PCR method, 12 of which were Enterococcus faecium and17 were Enterococcus faecalis species. In dogs, 16 E. faecalis and six E. faeciumstrains were identified, whereas in cats, six E. faecium and only one E. faecalisstrain were identified. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by theKirby-Bauer disk diffusion method for nine antimicrobials: penicillin,ampicillin, vancomycin, nitrofurantoin, rifampicin, tetracycline,chloramphenicol, enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin. The isolates were tested forhigh-level resistance to streptomycin and gentamicin. The highest resistance ofEnterococcus spp. was observed to rifampicin (86%) and enrofloxacin (83%),followed by tetracycline and ciprofloxacin (69%). Resistance to vancomycin was28%, and the lowest resistance was to chloramphenicol (17%). Multidrug resistancewas found in 76% of enterococci isolates. High-level streptomycin resistance was detected in 17% and high-level gentamicin resistance in 10% of the isolatedenterococci. When comparing species susceptibility, E. faecium isolates weresignificantly more resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, nitrofurantoin, andciprofloxacin (p < 0.05). Eleven E. faecium isolates (92%) and 12 E. faecalisisolates (76%) were multidrug resistant.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cysticercosis and Neurocysticercosis (NCC) can be studied usingseveral animal species in experimental models which contributes to theunderstanding of the human form of the disease. Experimental infections of Taeniaspp. are vital in explaining the modes of transmission of the parasite and helps the understanding of transmission of the parasite in humans and thus may beuseful in designing therapeutic and immune-prophylactic studies to combat thedisease. Thus, this systematic review aims to explore the existing experimentalanimal models to the understanding of cysticercosis in both humans and animalsand elucidate the risk factors of cysticercosis and identify the Taenia spp. usedin these models. METHODOLOGY: We systematically identified all publications from the Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Pubmed regarding experimental animalmodels using Taenia spp. that cause cysticercosis in both humans and animals. 58 studies were identified for eligibility. Of these, only 48 studies met theinclusion criteria from which data extraction was done and presenteddescriptively. RESULTS: Pigs, cattle, gerbils, mice, rats, voles, monkeys, cats, dogs, and goats were used in which T. solium, T. saginata, T. saginata asiatica, T. crassiceps and T. asiatica were studied. The routes used to induce diseasewere; oral, intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal,intraarterial, intracranial, intraduodenal, and surgical routes using eggs,oncospheres, and proglottids. Besides, the establishment of infection using eggs and oncospheres was affected by the route used to induce infection in theexperimental animals. The cysticerci recovery rate in all the experimentalstudies was low and the number of animals used in these experiments varied from 1to 84. Although not analysed statistically, sex, age, and breed of animalsinfluenced the cysticerci recovery rate. Additionally, the cysticerci recoveryrate and antibody-antigen levels were shown to increase with an increase in thedose of oncospheres and eggs inoculated in the animals. Contrasting results were reported in which the cysticerci recovery rate decreased with an increase in the dose of eggs inoculated. CONCLUSION: This review describes the various animalexperiments using Taenia species that cause cysticercosis highlighting theanimals used, age and their breed, the routes of infection used to induce diseaseand the sample size used, and the cysticerci recovery rate in these animalmodels.

AB  - Rabies remains a public health problem in the Philippines despite the widespread provision of rabies vaccines and rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) as post-exposureprophylaxis (PEP). Detailed descriptions of recent human rabies cases in thePhilippines are scarce. This study aimed to describe the clinical,epidemiological, and spatial features of human rabies cases between January 1,2006, and December 31, 2015. We conducted a retrospective hospital-based caserecord review of all patients admitted to one referral hospital in Manila whoreceived a clinical diagnosis of rabies. During the 10-year study period therewere 575 patients (average 57.5 cases per year, range 57 to 119) with a finaldiagnosis of rabies. Most patients were male (n = 404, 70.3%) and aged >/= 20years (n = 433, 75.3%). Patients mostly came from the National Capital Region (n = 160, 28.0%) and the adjacent Regions III (n = 197, 34.4%) and IV-A (n = 168,29.4%). Case mapping and heatmaps showed that human rabies cases werecontinuously observed in similar areas throughout the study period. Most patientshad hydrophobia (n = 444, 95.5%) and/or aerophobia (n = 432, 93.3%). The leading causative animals were dogs (n = 421, 96.3%) and cats (n = 16, 3.7%). Among 437patients with animal exposure history, only 42 (9.6%) had been administered atleast one rabies vaccine. Two patients (0.5%), young children bitten on theirface, had received and a full course of rabies vaccine. Human rabies patientswere continuously admitted to the hospital, with no notable decline over thestudy period. The geographical area in which human rabies cases commonly occurredalso did not change. Few patients received PEP and there were two suspected casesof PEP failure. The retrospective design of this study was a limitation; thus,prospective studies are required.

TI  - Retrospective evaluation of jugular venous blood variables and mortality incritically ill hospitalized cats.
LID - 10.1111/vec.13232 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinicopathological variables associated with hospitalmortality in critically ill cats with compromised hemodynamics and tissuehypoperfusion. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: Privatereferral center. ANIMALS: Fifty-seven critically ill cats with compromisedhemodynamics or tissue hypoperfusion. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The electronic medical records were searched for all cats admitted from June 2014 to November 2020. Cats were included in the study if the medicalrecords clearly identified the presence of compromised hemodynamics and tissuehypoperfusion. Blood samples were obtained by percutaneous puncture of theexternal jugular vein, and blood gases, electrolytes, L-lactate concentration,and glucose were measured by a point-of-care analyzer. A predictive logisticregression model for mortality was performed. A total of 57 cats were ultimately included in the study. Thirty-five cats died. Eighteen of them were euthanizedbecause of the severity of illness, and 17 died naturally. Twenty-two cats weredischarged alive from the hospital. After adjusting for the Acute PatientPhysiologic and Laboratory Evaluation (APPLE) fast score and disease category,jugular venous partial pressure of oxygen (Pvjo2 ) and HCT at admission wereindependent predictors of hospital mortality (HCT: odds ratio [OR], 0.763, 95%confidence interval [CI]: 0.625-0.930; P = 0.008; Pjvo2 : OR, 0.858; 95% CI:0.749-0.984; P = 0.029). The association of these variables with mortality wasmaintained after conducting a sensitivity analysis and excluding cats that diedby euthanasia. CONCLUSIONS: In cats with hemodynamic instability and tissuehypoperfusion, HCT and Pvjo2 behaved as independent predictors of mortality. Bothvariables seem to reflect the magnitude of oxygen debt and tissue hypoperfusion.

TI  - V1-origin Bidirectional Plasticity in Visual Thalamo-ventral Pathway and ItsContribution to Saliency Detection of Dynamic Visual Inputs.

LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0539-22.2022 [doi]
AB  - Visual neural plasticity and V1 saliency-detection are vital for efficient-codingof dynamically changing visual inputs. However, how does neural plasticitycontribute to saliency-detection of temporal-statistically distributed visualstream remains unclear. Therefore, we adopted randomly presented but unevenlydistributed stimuli with multiple orientations, and examined the single-unitresponses evoked by this biased orientation-adaptation protocol, by single-unitrecordings in the visual thalamo-ventral pathway of cats (of either sex). Wefound neuronal responses potentiated when the probability of biased orientationwas slightly higher than other non-biased ones, and suppressed when theprobability became much higher. This single-neuronal short-termbidirectional-plasticity is selectively induced by optimal stimuli, butinter-ocularly transferable. It is inducible in LGN, Area 17 and Area 21a withdistinct and hierarchically progressive patterns. With the results oflatency-analysis, receptive-field structural test, cortical lesion andsimulations, we suggest this bidirectional-plasticity may principally originatefrom the adaptation-competition between excitatory and inhibitory components ofV1 neuronal receptive-field. In our simulation, above bidirectional-plasticitycould achieve saliency-detection of dynamic visual inputs. These findingsdemonstrate a rapid probability-dependant plasticity on the neural coding ofvisual stream, and suggest its functional role in the efficient-coding andsaliency-detection of dynamic environment.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTNovel elementswithin a dynamic visual stream can "pop-up" from the context, vital for rapidresponse to dynamically changing world. "Saliency-detection" is a promisingbottom-up mechanism contributing to efficient selection of visual inputs, whereinvisual adaptation also plays a significant role. However, the saliency-detection of dynamic visual stream is poorly understood. Here we found a novel form ofvisual short-term bidirectional-plasticity in multi-stages of visual system that contributes to saliency-detection of dynamic visual inputs. Thisbidirectional-plasticity may principally originate from the local balance ofexcitation-inhibition in primary visual cortex, and propagates to lower andhigher visual areas with progressive pattern-change. Our findings suggest theexcitation-inhibition balance within visual system contributing to visualefficient-coding.

AB  - Cats exhibit high susceptibility to urinary organ-related diseases. Weinvestigated the healthy ureter morphologies and compared these with ureters thatwere surgically resected distal to a urolithiasis obstruction in cats. Healthyureters (total length 9.88 +/- 0.38 cm) developed adventitia composed of collagenfibers (ADCF), containing a longitudinal muscular layer, toward the distalsegment. The healthy ureter was the smallest in the middle segment (4.71-6.90 cm from the urinary bladder) with significantly decreased luminal and submucosalareas compared to those in the proximal segment. Diseased cats exhibited a highincidence of calcium oxalate urolithiasis with renal dysfunction, regardless ofage, sex, and body size. Diseased ureters showed increased perimeters,inflammation, and decreased nerves in ADCF. Collagen fibers were increased in thesubmucosal area, intermuscular spaces, and ADCF, particularly near the obstructedlesion. The mean resected ureter length was 5.66 +/- 0.49 cm, suggesting a highobstruction risk in the middle segment. The middle segment also increased thecross-sectional area of the ureter and ADCF, regardless of the distance from the obstructed lesion. The ureters in several cases either lacked the transitionalepithelium, or exhibited transitional epithelial hyperplasia, and some of theseformed the mucosal folds. In conclusion, we demonstrated the followingcharacteristics and histopathological features of cat ureters: decreases in theureter size, lumen area, and submucosa area from proximal to middle segment inhealthy; ADCF changes in urolithiasis, including increased connective tissueswith inflammation and decreased nerves. These data are important to understandthe pathogenesis of feline ureteral obstruction.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe the endoscopic appearance ofgastroduodenal ulcers (GDUs), and to assess the clinical, ultrasonographic andhistological data, as well as long-term follow-up, in cats. METHODS: The medical record databases of five veterinary endoscopists were evaluated between January2016 and 2020, in a retrospective study. Cats with at least one gastric orduodenal ulcer detected by endoscopic examination were included. All the medical records of the selected cats were reviewed and information was collectedregarding breed, age, sex, neuter status, medical history, clinical signs, andultrasonographic, endoscopic and histological findings. The cats were evaluatedat 6, 12 and 18 months. RESULTS: Sixty-one cats with a median age of 9.0 years(range 2.0-16.0) were included in the study. The most common complaints werevomiting (n = 55; 90%) and hyporexia (n = 40; 66%); haematemesis was reported in 12 (20%) cats. Endoscopy showed GDUs in the following locations: gastric body in 28 cats (46%), antropyloric area in 34 cats (56%), fundus in 13 cats (21%) andduodenum in eight cats (13%). A single GDU was found in 42 cats (69%) andmultiple GDUs were seen in 19 cats (31%). Histopathological evaluation revealedbenign lesions in 33 (54%) cats and malignant lesions in 28 (46%; 24 high-gradelymphoma, one low-grade lymphoma and three carcinoma). High-grade lymphoma wasdetected only in the stomach. Cats diagnosed with malignant GDUs (median 10.5,range 4-16) were significantly older than cats with benign lesions (P = 0.002).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: GDUs are common and were detected in 5.1% of catsundergoing an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The risk of a malignant ulcerincreases proportionally with each year of increasing age. GDU location, numberand morphological appearance do not provide any indication of the nature of theulcer; however, duodenal ulcers are frequently benign. Endoscopic examinationfacilitates the early and minimally invasive detection of GDUs in cats.

AB  - Pet food has recently been in the spotlight as an auxiliary approach to manageoral health, since it helps dogs or cats to take relatively simple care of their mouths at home. Especially, dental hygiene chew is crucial to remove teethaccumulation or plaque by chemical or mechanical methods. This study applied 3Dprinting to dental chews, which should be tailored to dogs' individual toothstructure and preferences. The optimum methods for making dental hygiene chewsbased on corn starch with glycerin for extrusion-based 3D printing weredeveloped. The viscoelasticity of dental chews increased with increasing glycerincontent. According to the infill level (40%, 60%, or 80%) and glycerin content,texture and plaque removal efficacy were investigated using a texture analyzerand dog dentures. A 60% infill level with 10% and 20% glycerin content had thebest plaque removal efficacy in both canines and premolars. A lattice structuredesign with square holes was more effective for canines, whereas a crumblytexture was more effective for premolars.

PG  - e9105
LID - 10.1002/ece3.9105 [doi]
AB  - Invasive mesopredators are responsible for the decline of many species of native mammals worldwide. Feral cats have been causally linked to multiple extinctionsof Australian mammals since European colonization. While feral cats are foundthroughout Australia, most research has been undertaken in arid habitats, thusthere is a limited understanding of feral cat distribution, abundance, andecology in Australian tropical rainforests. We carried out camera-trappingsurveys at 108 locations across seven study sites, spanning 200 km in theAustralian Wet Tropics. Single-species occupancy analysis was implemented toinvestigate how environmental factors influence feral cat distribution. Feralcats were detected at a rate of 5.09 photographs/100 days, 11 times higher thanpreviously recorded in the Australian Wet Tropics. The main environmental factorsinfluencing feral cat occupancy were a positive association with terrainruggedness, a negative association with elevation, and a higher affinity forrainforest than eucalypt forest. These findings were consistent with otherstudies on feral cat ecology but differed from similar surveys in Australia.Increasingly harsh and consistently wet weather conditions at higher elevations, and improved shelter in topographically complex habitats may drive cat preferencefor lowland rainforest. Feral cats were positively associated with roads,supporting the theory that roads facilitate access and colonization of feral catswithin more remote parts of the rainforest. Higher elevation rainforests with no roads could act as refugia for native prey species within the critical weightrange. Regular monitoring of existing roads should be implemented to monitorferal cats, and new linear infrastructure should be limited to preventencroachment into these areas. This is pertinent as climate change modelingsuggests that habitats at higher elevations will become similar to lowerelevations, potentially making the environment more suitable for feral catpopulations.

AB  - Humans' individual differences including their demographics, personality,attitudes and experiences are often associated with important outcomes for theanimals they interact with. This is pertinent to companion animals such as catsand dogs, given their social and emotional importance to humans and degree ofintegration into human society. However, the mechanistic underpinnings and causalrelationships that characterise links between human individual differences andcompanion animal behaviour and wellbeing are not well understood. In thisexploratory investigation, we firstly quantified the underlying structure of, andvariation in, human's styles of behaviour during typical human-cat interactions(HCI), focusing on aspects of handling and interaction known to be preferred bycats (i.e. 'best practice'), and their variation. We then explored the potential significance of various human individual differences as predictors of these HCIstyles. Seven separate HCI styles were identified via Principal ComponentAnalysis (PCA) from averaged observations for 119 participants, interacting with sociable domestic cats within a rehoming context. Using General Linear Models(GLMs) and an Information Theoretic (IT) approach, we found these HCI PCcomponents were weakly to strongly predicted by factors including cat-ownershiphistory, participant personality (measured via the Big Five Inventory, or BFI),age, work experience with animals and participants' subjective ratings of theircat behaviour knowledge. Paradoxically, greater cat ownership experiences andself-assessed cat knowledge were not positively associated with 'best practice'styles of HCI, but were instead generally predictive of HCI styles known to beless preferred by cats, as was greater participant age and Neuroticism. Thesefindings have important implications regarding the quality of human-companionanimal relationships and dyadic compatibility, in addition to the role ofeducational interventions and their targeting for optimal efficacy. In thecontext of animal adoption, these results strengthen the (limited) evidence base for decision making associated with cat-adopter screening and matching. Inparticular, our results suggest that greater cat ownership experiences andself-reports of cat knowledge might not necessarily convey advantages for cats inthe context of HCI.

AB  - The domestic cat is the most susceptible host to Sporothrix infection, developingsevere clinical forms. Few effective antifungal agents are available for treatingfeline sporotrichosis, and cases of treatment failure are common. Treatmentsuccess depends on cat health status, therapy-related factors, as well associal/economic issues, but it is mainly contingent upon the host-fungusinteraction. The owner's adherence is critical and should be reinforcedthroughout the treatment to increase the chances of a successful outcome. Theantifungal agents described for feline sporotrichosis are most often used inmonotherapy regimens. Due to cases in which the treatment with itraconazolefailed, the use of antifungal agents in combination should be considered toachieve synergy. The combination of itraconazole and potassium iodide represents an important option for the treatment of naive cats presenting multiple cutaneouslesions, nasal mucosal lesions and/or respiratory signs, as well as forrefractory cases. However, the therapeutic options for unsuccessfully treatedcases are scarce. Therefore new options are needed, even more taking into accountthat there are many in vitro potential molecules not available for use in catsyet. More studies are necessary to correlate in vitro antifungal susceptibilitytests results and the outcome of cats treated due to sporotrichosis. This review will briefly discuss both the antifungal drugs and treatment protocols used incats with sporotrichosis, as well as the determinants of treatment failure.

AB  - Green tea cream, the precipitate formed in cooled green tea infusion, appears anegative effect on flavor. To explain the mechanism of green tea cream,complexations between four catechins (CATs) and caffeine (CAF) were engineeredand characterized. Dynamic light scattering, high performance liquidchromatography, scanning electron microscopy, fourier-transform infraredspectroscopy, UV-visible absorption spectrum, and x-ray diffraction were used to reveal the differences between ester catechins and non-ester catechins in thedynamic complexation process, particle shape, and precipitate mechanism withcaffeine. The results indicated that CATs and CAF affected each other'smicroenvironment in aqueous solution and Guanidine hydrochloride (GH) weakenedthe effect both in solution and precipitate. In addition, the 1:1 complexstructure of EGC-CAF was first proved, the hydrogen bond, CH...pi and pi...piinteraction were the forces of CAT-CAF complexes by XRD. These results provided anew perspective to the mechanism analysis of green tea cream.

TI  - Outcome of surgical treatment of perineal hernia in cats: 36 cases (2013-2019).
LID - 10.1111/jsap.13534 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To report the clinical presentation, complications, and long-termoutcomes of cats treated for perineal hernia with modified internal obturatormuscle transposition. METHODS: The medical records of cats surgically treated forperineal hernia between 2013 and 2019 were reviewed and an owner questionnairewas conducted to determine long-term outcome. RESULTS: Thirty-six cats wereincluded in the study: 34 had bilateral and two unilateral hernias. Of these 36, 24 (67%) were male neutered with a median age of 10 (range: 1 to 18) years. Thecomplication rate was low, however, one cat experienced a major postoperativecomplication: rectal prolapse requiring revision surgery 48 hours postsurgery.Short-term outcomes were available for 32 of 36 (89%) cats. Of the 32, 23 wereexamined 6 weeks postoperatively, and a telephonic consultation was performed foran additional nine of 32. Of the 23 cats examined directly, none had recurrence. Overall 12 of 32 experienced short-term postoperative tenesmus which resolved in nine of 12 (75%). Long-term outcomes were available for 31 of 36 cats (86%), witha median of 18.5 (6 to 89) months follow-up. A good outcome was achieved in 23 of31 (74%) whereas three of 31 (10%) had fair outcomes and five of 31 (16%) had apoor outcome. Of the five cats with a poor outcome, two required subtotalcolectomy to manage clinical signs related to megacolon, two were euthanisedfollowing a return of clinical signs, and one developed unilateral recurrence.CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Perineal hernia should be considered in cats presentingwith tenesmus or recurrent obstipation. Surgical treatment of perineal hernias incats can result in good owner-assessed long-term outcome.

TI  - Surface Display of Peptides Corresponding to the Heptad Repeat 2 Domain of theFeline Enteric Coronavirus Spike Protein on Bacillus subtilis Spores ElicitsProtective Immune Responses Against Homologous Infection in a FelineAminopeptidase-N-Transduced Mouse Model.
PG  - 925922
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.925922 [doi]
AB  - Although feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection is extremely common in cats, thereare currently few effective treatments. A peptide derived from the heptad repeat 2 (HR2) domain of the coronavirus (CoV) spike protein has shown effective forinhibition of various human and animal CoVs in vitro, but further use of FCoV-HR2in vivo has been limited by lack of practical delivery vectors and small animalinfection model. To overcome these technical challenges, we first constructed arecombinant Bacillus subtilis (rBS(CotB-HR2P)) expressing spore coat protein B(CotB) fused to an HR2-derived peptide (HR2P) from a serotype II feline entericCoV (FECV). Immunogenic capacity was evaluated in mice after intragastric orintranasal administration, showing that recombinant spores could trigger strongspecific cellular and humoral immune responses. Furthermore, we developed a novelmouse model for FECV infection by transduction with its primary receptor (feline aminopeptidase N) using an E1/E3-deleted adenovirus type 5 vector. This model canbe used to study the antiviral immune response and evaluate vaccines or drugs,and is an applicable choice to replace cats for the study of FECV. Oraladministration of rBS(CotB-HR2P) in this mouse model effectively protectedagainst FECV challenge and significantly reduced pathology in the digestivetract. Owing to its safety, low cost, and probiotic features, rBS(CotB-HR2P) is apromising oral vaccine candidate for use against FECV/FCoV infection in cats.

PG  - 854468
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2022.854468 [doi]
AB  - Toxocariasis, a neglected parasitic zoonosis with worldwide distribution, hasbeen reportedly associated to different risk factors in several epidemiologicaland meta-analysis studies. However, dog and cat contact (environmental and animalexposure) as isolated associated risk factor for children and adults remains tobe fully established. Accordingly, the present meta-analysis has aimed todirectly assess dog and cat contact for toxocariasis seropositivity in under-18and adult persons, using a survey strategy of PubMed/Medline, Embase, Scopus and Scielo Databases, from January 2009 to December 2021. A meta-analysis model ofrandom effects was applied to estimate odds ratio (OR) with 95% ConfidenceInterval (CI). The statistical heterogeneity was evaluated by the Cochran Q-Test and I (2) values. A total of 41 transversal studies (n = 20.515 individuals) fromdifferent geographic regions (classified by the World Health Organization) wereincluded herein. In overall, 1,882/13,496 (13.95%; 95% IC = 13.4-14.5) youngersand 513/7.019 (7.3%; 95% CI = 6.7-7.9) adults in contact with dogs or cats wereserologically reagent for anti-Toxocara antibodies. Association of dog and catcontact was observed only in youngers, with both dogs (OR = 1.53; p < 0.0001) andcats (OR = 1.64; p = 0.0001). In addition, association of dog and contact andserology was statistically significant in populations of Americas (OR = 1.37; 95%CI = 1.1-1.7), Middle East (OR = 2.9; 95% CI = 1.6-5.1) and West Pacific (OR =1.6; 95% IC = 1.3-1.9). In conclusion, contact with dogs and cats, particularlyby younger individuals and in regions such as Americas, Middle East, and WestPacific, should be always a public health concern for toxocariasis. Moreover,dogs and cats should be periodically dewormed, washed and hair cleaned prior tocontact with youngers. Finally, robust statistical results herein may serve asbasis for future strategies and preventive measures for safer dog and catcontact.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Feline injection-site sarcomas (FISSs) are malignant mesenchymaltumors of different histotypes. The pathogenesis of FISS has been correlated withchronic inflammation, resulting in neoplastic transformation. Activation of theJanus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) have beendemonstrated to play a critical role in tumor development by regulating signalingpathways involved in cell proliferation, survival, metastasis, and angiogenesisin human medicine. To characterize the role of STAT3 in FISS, we first detectedSTAT3 and phosphorylated STAT3 in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE)FISS tissues using immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: STAT3 was detected in88.9% (40/45) of FISS cases, and phosphorylated STAT3 was detected in 53.3%(24/45) of cases. However, the expression levels of both forms of STAT3 were not correlated with tumor grade. To study the role of STAT3 in tumor survival, twoprimary cells derived from FISSs of two cats exhibiting consistentimmunophenotypes with their parental FFPE tissues were established. Adose-dependent inhibitory effect on cell proliferation was observed in bothprimary FISS cells treated with the STAT3 inhibitor,5-hydroxy-9,10-dioxo-9,10-dihydroanthracene-1-sulfonamide. CONCLUSIONS: The STAT 3 may play an important role in the tumorigenesis of FISS and be a potentialmolecular therapeutic target for FISS.

TI  - Prevalence of bacteriuria in cats with neurogenic bladder.
LID - 10.1007/s11259-022-09973-w [doi]
AB  - Urinary tract infections are defined as the adherence, multiplication, andpersistence of an infectious agent within the urogenital system, causing anassociated inflammatory response and clinical signs; instead, the presence ofbacteria in urine as determined by positive bacterial culture (PUC) from aproperly collected urine specimen, in the absence of clinical signs, is definedsubclinical bacteriuria. Limited information on the prevalence of PUC in spinalcord injury cats affected by neurogenic bladder (NB) is available. On contrary,in NB dogs and humans the prevalence of bacteriuria is well documented. Moreover,while in humans information about bacteriemia associated with NB is alreadyavailable, this aspect has never been studied in NB cats. The aim of thisprospective study was to determine the prevalence of PUC in cats with NB,compared to animals affected by chronic kidney disease (CKD) and healthy cats.Furthermore, the prevalence of bacteriemia in cats with NB was evaluated.Fifty-one cats met the inclusion criteria: 12 cats were affected by NB, 22 hadCKD and 17 were healthy. The prevalence of PUC was 58.33% and 18% in NB and CKDcat populations, respectively. All blood cultures were negative. The incompletebladder emptying and the decreased resistance in the bladder wall could beconsidered predisposing elements to PUC in the NB feline population. The results of this study highlight, for the first time, an high prevalence of PUC in catsaffected by NB, which was not found to be associated with bacteriemia.

AB  - Studies in cats and dogs have proven the usefulness of anti-Mullerian hormone(AMH) as a diagnostic tool to determine the castration status or to diagnoseovarian remnant syndrome. Yet the secretion pattern of AMH over the estrous cyclein queens has not been investigated so far. Seven healthy sexually intact female cats were examined daily for signs of estrous behavior over a trial period of 4months. Five queens showed regular estrous behavior, 1 queen was mated in herfirst heat and 1 queen never showed any signs of heat. To distinguish betweeninter-estrus and metestrus progesterone levels were determined. Serum samples forAMH and progesterone measurement were collected from the regular cycling queensin late anestrus, at several times during heat, inter-estrus and metestrus, from the mated queen during her first heat and during pregnancy, and in the acyclingqueen at various times during the trial period. The measured AMH values inanestrus were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than in heat (P < 0.001), metestrus(P = 0.12) and inter-estrus (P = 0.449). In anestrus the median AMH levels were10.26 ng/ml (range 4.96 to 22.90 ng/ml), in heat 5.97 ng/ml (range 3.32- 22.96ng/ml), in inter-estrus 10.47 (range 3.35-22.96 ng/ml) and in metestrus 6.38ng/ml (range 4.50-10.75 ng/ml. The pregnant cat showed median AMH concentrations of 6.47 ng/ml (range 5.60-9.80 ng/ml) during her pregnancy. The acycling queenhad solely low AMH values with a median concentration of 0.39 ng/ml. Inconclusion there were high variations of the AMH levels among and within theindividual cats and between heat cycles in the single cat. Remarkable high AMHconcentrations were measured in the younger queens of the study in their firstestrous cycles and also in anestrus, when less ovarian activity is expected.Further studies are necessary to emphasize the reasons for these high AMHconcentrations especially in young queens.

AB  - Meningioangiomatosis (MA) is a rare proliferative meningovascular entity that hasbeen described mainly in humans and dogs. Here we describe MA in a 13-y-oldspayed female domestic shorthaired cat that died 5 d after acute change inbehavior, open-mouth breathing, seizures, hyperthermia, and inability to walk. OnMRI, the lesion appeared predominantly as extraparenchymal hemorrhage. Autopsychanges consisted of a dark-red, hemorrhagic plaque that expanded theleptomeninges and outer neuroparenchyma of the right piriform and temporaltelencephalic lobes, chalky white nodules in the peripancreatic fat, and yellowfluid in the abdomen. Histologically, the lesion in the brain consisted ofleptomeningeal thickening by spindle cells that effaced the subarachnoid spacesand extended perivascularly into the underlying cerebral cortex. Spindle cellswere arranged as streams or whorls around blood vessels, and had slendereosinophilic cytoplasm and elongated nuclei with coarsely stippled chromatin and 1 or 2 distinct nucleoli. There was extensive hemorrhage, clusters ofhemosiderin-laden macrophages, and mineralization throughout. Spindle cells hadpositive immunolabeling for vimentin. A striking MRI and gross feature in ourcase was the extensive hemorrhage associated with the MA lesion. Additionalfindings included suppurative pancreatitis with peritonitis and supraspinatusmyonecrosis.

AB  - Marine mammals, regarded as sentinels of aquatic ecosystem health, are exposed todifferent pathogens and parasites under natural conditions. We surveyed liveSouth American fur seals Arctocephalus australis and South American sea lionsOtaria flavescens in Uruguay for Leptospira spp., canine distemper virus (CDV),Mycobacterium spp., Toxoplasma gondii, and Neospora caninum. Samples werecollected from 2007 to 2013. The seroprevalence of Leptospira spp. was 37.6%positive, 50.9% negative, and 11.5% suspect for A. australis (n = 61) while forO. flavescens (n = 12) it was 67% positive, 25% negative, and 8% suspect. CDV RNAwas not detected in any of the analyzed samples. Most animals tested seropositiveto tuberculosis antigens by WiZo ELISA (A. australis: 29/30; O. flavescens:20/20); reactivity varied with a novel ELISA test (antigens MPB70, MPB83, ESAT6and MPB59). Seroprevalence against N. caninum and T. gondii was 6.7 and 13.3%positive for O. flavescens and 0 and 2.2% positive for A. australis respectively.To evaluate possible sources of infection for pinnipeds, wild rats Rattus rattus and semi-feral cats Felis catus were also tested for Leptospira spp. and T.gondii respectively. Water samples tested for Leptospira revealed saprofitic L.bioflexa. Pathogenic Leptospira were detected in the kidneys of 2 rats, and cats tested positive for T. gondii (100%). These results represent a substantialcontribution to the study of the health status of wild pinnipeds in Uruguay.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to describe diseases, complications andoutcomes associated with the use of feeding tubes in a population of sick catswith appetite disturbance managed at an internal medicine referral service.METHODS: Clinicopathological data from cats receiving nasoenteral (NE) oroesophagostomy (O) tubes were studied. Cats were categorised according to theirunderlying disease and divided into subgroups (NE or O tube). The followingfactors associated with survival were analysed: disease category, type of tubeand return to appetite. RESULTS: Included in the study were 112 cats,representing 118 cases. Of the 118 cases, 98 (83%) and 20 (17%) received NE or O tubes, respectively. The most common underlying conditions were digestive(13.5%), hepatobiliary (11%) and upper urinary tract (11%) disorders.Hepatobiliary (50%) and upper respiratory tract (30%) conditions were predominantin the O tube group. Digestive (15%) and upper urinary tract (12%) diseases were more common in the NE tube group. Complications following tube placement occurredin 22/118 cases (18.6%). The global survival rate was 73% and did not differbetween NE (71.4%) and O tube (80%) groups (P = 1.00) or disease categories (P = 0.61). Return of appetite before feeding tube removal occurred in 56 cases (47%),within a median of 3 days (range 1-30) and was not associated with mirtazapineadministration (P = 1.00). Appetite returned earlier for cats with NE tubes (3days, range 1-17) than for those with O tubes (33 days, range 5-60; P <0.05).Voluntary food intake was positively associated with survival (odds ratio 15.17).After discharge and feeding tube retrieval, return of appetite was observed in67% of cases. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Feeding tubes were predominantly placed for the management of appetite disturbance in cats with digestive, hepatobiliary and upper urinary tract diseases. While complications were frequent, they weremostly mild, easily managed and did not preclude feeding tube use. Return toappetite occurred in a large proportion of cats during or after assisted enteral feeding and was associated with survival.

AB  - Case series summary The objective of this case series was to describe thepresentation, surgical treatment and outcome of a congenital intrahepaticportosystemic shunt (IHPSS) in 12 cats. A retrospective case series of catsundergoing surgical treatment for an IHPSS was undertaken. Signalment, clinicalsigns, imaging, surgical treatment, complications and short-term outcome (<30days) were obtained using medical records. Long-term outcome (>1 year after firstsurgery) was obtained, where possible, using a health-related quality of lifeowner questionnaire. Seven cats were diagnosed with a left divisional shunt,three with a central divisional shunt and two with a right divisional shunt usingintraoperative mesenteric portovenography. Three cats tolerated complete acutesuture attenuation, eight cats underwent partial suture attenuation, four ofwhich received complete suture ligation at a second surgery, and one catunderwent partial attenuation with a thin film band. Six cats (50%) developedpost-attenuation neurological signs (PANS) after first surgery and two cats (17%)died or were euthanased due to severe PANS. Long-term outcome was available foreight cats (67%), with a median follow-up time of 1743 days (range 364-2228), andwas described as excellent in five cats (63%), fair in two cats (25%) and poor inone cat (12%).Relevance and novel information Few papers exist that describe the presentation, intraoperative imaging, treatment and outcome of IHPSSs in cats.This is the first to describe surgical attenuation with a thin film band in a catwith an IHPSS. This case series reports excellent long-term outcomes in amajority of surgically treated cats with IHPSS.

TI  - Update of the Epidemiology of the Sporotrichosis Epidemic in the state of RioGrande do Sul, Brazil.
LID - 10.1111/myc.13497 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sporotrichosis is a disease not requiring jurisdictional notificationand consequently is underreported in Brazil. Therefore, the epidemiologicalpicture even in hyperendemic states is unknown. Thus, we evaluated the occurrenceof sporotrichosis throughout the territory of the southern state of Brazil, RioGrande do Sul (RS). METHODS: We update the epidemiological situation ofsporotrichosis in the southern region of this state and describe the emergence ofthis disease in the Metropolitan region. We engaged professionals from RSenrolled in animal health care in answering a questionnaire regardingsporotrichosis. RESULTS: The occurrence of local cases of feline sporotrichosiswas reported by 83% of the participants from 40 cities, distributed through theseven health districts of RS. Human sporotrichosis cases, transmitted by cats,were also reported by professionals from four regions of the state. The frequencyof the disease in both the South and Metropolitan regions showed a markedincrease in recent years. CONCLUSION: Feline and cat-transmitted humansporotrichosis is an underreported mycosis in RS, widely distributed in theterritory of this state and increasing. Aggressive public health policies areurgently necessary to control the geographical expansion of this spreadingmycosis.

TI  - Outcome and Prognostic Factors in Cats Undergoing Resection of IntestinalAdenocarcinomas: 58 Cases (2008-2020).
PG  - 911666
LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.911666 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this multi-institutional retrospective study was to expand theavailable data pertaining to pre-operative clinical findings, progression-freeand overall survival times, and potential prognostic factors for cats undergoing surgery for intestinal adenocarcinomas. Fifty-eight cats treated over a 12-yearperiod were included in the study. Progression-free and overall survival timeswere estimated using Kaplan-Meier analyses. Potential prognostic variables wereevaluated for associations with progression-free and overall survival usingunivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. Prior to surgery, theintestinal mass was identified using ultrasonography in 89% of cats in which itwas applied; however, imaging findings suggestive of intrathoracic metastaseswere observed in only 9% of cats. Among 22 cats undergoing ultrasound-guided fineneedle aspiration cytology, the results agreed with the results of histopathologyin only 10 cats. Discordant results were most commonly related to the presence ofmarked inflammation in cytology samples, which may have obscured the presence of neoplastic cells. Diffuse intestinal small cell lymphoma was identified as acomorbidity in 5 cats. Resection of the tumor with the objective of obtainingwide surgical margins was performed in each cat. On histopathology, 20 tumorswere classified as mucinous adenocarcinoma and 28 were adenocarcinoma nototherwise specified. Intestinal transection site margins were complete in 94% of cats; however, complete mural margins were present in only 15% of cats. Locallymph node metastases were identified in 52% of cats and carcinomatosis wasdiagnosed in 81% of cats. Disease progression was documented in 32 of the 58 cats(55%). Of these 32 cats, 14 (43%) had local recurrence of the primary intestinal tumor. Median progression-free survival was 203 days (95% CI 130-299 days), andmedian overall survival time was 284 days (95% CI 200-363 days). Mitotic countwas inversely associated with progression-free survival (HR 1.04; 95% CI1.01-1.07, P = 0.005); however, none of the remaining potential prognosticfactors, including administration of adjuvant chemotherapy, were significantlyassociated with progression-free or overall survival. Feline intestinaladenocarcinoma remains an aggressive and highly fatal disease. Large, randomized controlled clinical trials will be needed to improve the survival prospects foraffected cats.

TI  - International Delphi consensus guidelines for follow-up after prophylactic total gastrectomy: the Life after Prophylactic Total Gastrectomy (LAP-TG) study.
LID - 10.1007/s10120-022-01318-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prophylactic total gastrectomy (PTG) remains the only means ofpreventing gastric cancer for people with genetic mutations predisposing toHereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer (HDGC), mainly in the CDH1 gene. The small but growing cohort of people undergoing PTG at a young age are expected to have alife-expectancy close to the general population, however, knowledge of thelong-term effects of, and monitoring requirements after, PTG is limited. Thisstudy aims to define the standard of care for follow-up after PTG. METHODS:Through a combination of literature review and two-round Delphi consensus ofmajor HDGC/PTG units and physicians, and patient advocates, we produced a set of recommendations for follow-up after PTG. RESULTS: There were 42 first round, and 62 second round, responses from clinicians, allied health professionals andpatient advocates. The guidelines include recommendations for timing ofassessments and specialties involved in providing follow-up, micronutrientsupplementation and monitoring, bone health and the provision of writteninformation. CONCLUSION: While the evidence supporting the guidelines is limited,expert consensus provides a framework to best manage people following PTG, andcould support the collection of information on the long-term effects of PTG.

TI  - Exploring the effect of implementing affordable socially assistive pet robots in eight care homes before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: a stratified clusterrandomised controlled trial and mixed-method study.
LID - 10.2196/38864 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Robot pets may assist towards challenges of supporting an agingpopulation with growing dementia prevalence. Prior work focused on impacts ofrobot seal Paro on older adult wellbeing, but recent studies suggest goodacceptability and implementation feasibility of more affordable devices (Joy for All (JfA) cats and dogs). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to respond to limited effectivenessresearch. METHODS: We conducted an eight-month, stratified, cluster randomisedcontrolled trial, in eight care homes in Cornwall, UK. Over four months, fourcare homes each received two JfA devices (one cat and dog), and four homesreceived care as usual (intervention and control group). Psychometrics werecollected pre and post intervention, to compare change from baseline to follow-upin the intervention vs control group. In the final four months, all eight carehomes had devices, but only qualitative data was collected, due to Covid-19 andreduced capacity. The primary outcome was neuropsychiatric symptoms(Neuropsychiatric Inventory - Nursing Home version (NPI)). Care provider burdenwas a secondary outcome (occupational disruptiveness NPI subscale), alongside theChallenging Behaviour scale, Holden Communication scale, Campaign to EndLoneliness questionnaire and medication use. Qualitative data was collectedthrough care staff observation calendars and end-of-study interviews tounderstand use, experience and impact. We also collected demographic data andassessed dementia severity. In total, 253 residents had robot interactionopportunities, and 83 were consented for direct data collection. RESULTS: Therewas a significant difference in total change from baseline to follow-up for NPI(p=.000) and occupational disruptiveness (p=.031) scores between the interventionand control group. Neuropsychiatric symptoms increased in the control group,while decreasing in the intervention group. No significant difference was seenfor communication issues or challenging behaviour. On NPI sub-domains, there was a significant difference from baseline to follow-up for delusions (p=.034),depression (p=.010), anxiety (p=.001), elation (p=.023) and apathy (p=.009), all of which decreased in the intervention group and increased slightly in thecontrol group. The summative impact results suggested most residents whointeracted with robots received a positive impact (85%, 46/54). Those whointeracted had significantly higher dementia severity scores (p=.001) than those who did not interact. The qualitative results suggested good adoption andacceptability, suitability for subjectively lonely individuals, lack of noveltyeffect through sustained use and demonstrated 'reasons for use' of robots wereentertainment, anxiety and agitation. CONCLUSIONS: Affordable robot pets holdpotential in improving wellbeing for care home residents and people withdementia, including reduced neuropsychiatric symptoms and occupationaldisruptiveness. This work suggests no novelty effect, and contributes towardsunderstanding robot pet suitability, finding interactions were more common among residents with more moderate/severe dementia and potentially those subjectivelylonely. CLINICALTRIAL: This trial was pre-registered on Clinicaltrials.gov(https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04168463), and is reported following the CONSORT 2010 statement: extension to cluster randomised trials.

TI  - Laryngeal and swallow dysregulation following acute cervical spinal cord injury.
LID - 10.1152/jn.00469.2021 [doi]
AB  - Laryngeal function is vital to airway protection. While swallow is mediated bythe brainstem, mechanisms underlying increased risk of dysphagia after cervicalspinal cord injury (SCI) are unknown. We hypothesized that loss of descendingphrenic drive affects swallow and breathing differently, and loss of ascendingspinal afferent information alters swallow regulation. We recordedelectromyograms from upper airway and chest wall muscles in freely breathingpentobarbital-anesthetized cats and rats. Inspiratory laryngeal activityincreased ~two-fold following C2 lateral-hemisection. Ipsilateral to the injury, crural diaphragm EMG amplitude was reduced during breathing (62 +/- 25% changepost-injury), but no animal had complete termination of activity; 75% of animals increased contralateral diaphragm recruitment, but this did not reachsignificance. During swallow, laryngeal adductor and pharyngeal constrictormuscles increased activity, and diaphragm activity was bilaterally suppressed.This was unexpected because of the ipsilateral-specific response duringbreathing. Swallow-breathing coordination was also disrupted and more swallowsoccurred during early expiration. Finally, to determine if the chest wall is amajor source of feedback for laryngeal regulation, we performed T1 totaltransections in rats. As in the C2 lateral-hemisection, inspiratory laryngealrecruitment was the first feature noted. In contrast to the C2lateral-hemisection, diaphragmatic drive increased after T1 transection. Overall,we found that SCI alters laryngeal drive during swallow and breathing, andreduced swallow-related diaphragm activity. Our results show behavior-specificeffects, suggesting SCI affects swallow more than breathing, and emphasizes theneed for additional studies on the effects of ascending afferents from the spinalcord on laryngeal function.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the most common practices of Diplomates of the AmericanCollege of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care (DACVECCs) as they relate tothe recognition and treatment of hypotension in dogs and cats, particularlyconcerning the use of vasopressors in vasodilatory shock states. DESIGN: A surveyregarding vasopressor use was sent to all active DACVECCs using the VeterinaryInformation Network. Questions focused on respondent characteristics, method ofrecognition of hypotension, triggers for initiation of vasopressor therapy,first- and second-line vasopressor choice, and methods of determining response totherapy. SUBJECTS: A total of 734 DACVECCs were invited to participate, and 203Diplomates (27.7%) completed the survey. RESULTS: For both dogs and cats, themost common first-line vasopressor was norepinephrine (87.9% in dogs and 83.1% incats). The most common second-choice vasopressor was vasopressin (44.2% in dogsand 39.0% in cats). Cutoff values for initiating vasopressor therapy variedbetween species and modality used for blood pressure measurement. In general,most DACVECCs chose to initiate vasopressor therapy at a Doppler blood pressure<90 mm Hg or a mean arterial pressure of <60 or <65 mm Hg when usingoscillometric or direct arterial blood pressure measurements in dogs and cats.CONCLUSIONS: Most DACVECCs adhere to published human guidelines when choosing afirst-line vasopressor. However, there is significant variability in bloodpressure measurement technique, cutoffs for initiation of vasopressor use, andchoice of second-line vasopressors.

AB  - Elderly cats develop age-related behavioral and neuropathological changes thatultimately lead to cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS). These neuropathologiesshare similarities to those seen in the brains of humans with Alzheimer's disease(AD), including the extracellular accumulation of ss-amyloid (Abeta) andintraneuronal deposits of hyperphosphorylated tau, which are considered to be thetwo major hallmarks of AD. The present study assessed the presence anddistribution of Abeta and tau hyperphosphorylation within the cat brain (n = 55cats), and how the distribution of these proteins changes with age and thepresence of CDS. For this, immunohistochemistry was performed on seven brainregions from cats of various ages, with and without CDS (n = 10 with CDS). Catsaccumulate both intracytoplasmic and extracellular deposits of Abeta, as well as intranuclear and intracytoplasmic hyperphosphorylated tau deposits. Largeextracellular aggregates of Abeta were found in elderly cats, mainly in thecortical brain areas, with occasional hippocampal aggregates. This may suggestthat these aggregates start in cortical areas and later progress to thehippocampus. While Abeta senile plaques in people with AD have a dense core,extracellular Abeta deposits in cats exhibited a diffuse pattern, similar to the early stages of plaque pathogenesis. Intraneuronal Abeta deposits were alsoobserved, occurring predominantly in cortical brain regions of younger cats,while older cats had few to no intraneuronal Abeta deposits, especially whenextracellular aggregates were abundant. Intracytoplasmic hyperphosphorylated tau was found within neurons in the brains of elderly cats, particularly in thosewith CDS. Due to their ultrastructural features, these deposits are considered tobe pre-tangles, which are an early stage of the neurofibrillary tangles seen inAD. The largest numbers of pre-tangles are found mainly in the cerebral cortex ofelderly cats, whereas lower numbers were found in other regions (i.e., entorhinalcortex and hippocampus). For the first time, intranuclear tau was found in bothphosphorylated and non-phosphorylated states within neurons in the cat brain. Thehighest numbers of intranuclear deposits were found in the cortex of youngercats, and this tended to decrease with age. In contrast, elderly cats withpre-tangles had only occasional or no nuclear labelling.

TI  - Adjustment of multi-leaf collimator parameters in 4-MV and 6-MV IMRT: A study of veterinary clinical cases.
PG  - 407-413
LID - 10.5455/OVJ.2022.v12.i3.15 [doi]
AB  - Background: For optimal treatment, it is important to maintain optimal multi-leafcollimator (MLC) transmission in intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).However, adjustment of transmissions has not been reported in veterinarymedicine. Aim: To demonstrate that appropriate MLC parameter adjustment for IMRT using 4- and 6-MV energy can reduce the need for quality assurance revalidationin real companion animal clinical cases. Methods: The MLC parameters (leaftransmission and leaf offset) of the treatment planning system were adjusted byevaluating seven plans (10 x 10 cm, 3ABUT, DMLC, 7segA, FOURL, HDMLC, and HIMRT) and 20 preclinical cases (10 cases each in 4- and 6-MV groups). Subsequently, 101IMRT plans of 88 cases (77 dogs and 11 cats) were evaluated for absolute dose of plan target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OAR) and were analyzed for therelative dose distribution by gamma analysis (3%/3 mm, >10%) using EBT3 film.Results: After adjustment of the MLC parameters (leaf transmission and leafoffset, 4 MV: 0.008 and 0, 6 MV: 0.005 and 0, respectively), the data from 101plans (4 MV: 64 plans and 6 MV: 37 plans) treated with IMRT showed PTV <3%, OAR<5%, and gamma analysis pass rates >/=95% in all cases. Conclusion: Clinicallymeaningful dose distributions can be created even with a limited validationdevice if the treatment parameters are adjusted appropriately, even for tumors incanines and felines, where the irradiation field is small, the target is adjacentto the OAR, and the target is often superficial.

LID - 10.5455/OVJ.2022.v12.i3.2 [doi]
AB  - Background: Feline large granular lymphocyte lymphoma (LGLL) is a graveprognosis. However, the effectiveness of concurrent treatment with chemotherapyand activated lymphocyte therapy for feline LGLL has not been evaluated. CaseDescription: A 7-year-old, castrated male, domestic cat presented withgastrointestinal symptoms and an abdominal mass. A Tru-Cut biopsy of the massrevealed LGLL. The cat responded well to chemotherapy regimens ofcyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone, and L-asparaginase. Furthermore,activated lymphocyte therapy was added as an adjuvant treatment. The cat survived982 days from the first presentation and experienced few adverse events. Necropsywas performed and immunohistochemistry revealed that the neoplastic lymphocyteswere CD3(-)/CD20(-) cells. The final diagnosis was non-T/B LGLL. Conclusion:Minimal physical burden and a good initial response to chemotherapy might havecontributed to long-term survival in the present case. Moreover, activatedlymphocyte therapy could be performed safely and may be a feasible treatment for feline non-T/B LGLL.

TI  - Cutaneous epitheliotropic T-cell lymphoma in a donkey - a case report.
PG  - 267
LID - 10.1186/s12917-022-03365-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cutaneous epitheliotropic T-cell lymphoma is a malignant tumour ofthe skin already reported in humans, dogs, cats, horses, and other species, butnot previously in donkeys. The standard diagnosis is based on clinical,morphological and immunophenotypic data. Differentiation of malignant versusbenign proliferation of lymphocytes is crucial; in ambiguous cases T-cellreceptor gamma (TRG) molecular clonality should be tested. In the present paper, we report a case of mycosis fungoides diagnosed in a donkey whose diagnosis wasbased on clinical, histological and immunohistochemical aspects and a positiveTRG clonality test. CASE PRESENTATION: A twenty-five-year-old donkey gelding was referred with a mildly pruritic, generalised and severe exfoliative dermatosis.Otherwise, the animal was clinically healthy, though mildly underweight.Dermatological examination revealed severe generalised alopecic and exfoliativedermatitis, occasionally eroded, with high number of large, thin, greyish scales.All mucocutaneous junctions except the hoofs were affected. Ectoparasites anddermatophytes were ruled out. The complete blood count and blood smear evaluationrevealed mild normocytic normochromic anemia. The biochemistry panel showed mild hyperproteinemia with albumin within the normal range. Protein electrophoresisshowed moderate polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. Histological findings werecharacterised by interface dermatitis with massive exocytosis in the epidermis ofa homogenous population of lymphoid cells showing atypia. Clusters of neoplastic cells were present within the epidermis forming Pautrier "microabscesses". These findings are consistent with cutaneous epitheliotropic lymphoma.Immunohistochemical staining revealed uniform labelling of the neoplastic cellsfor CD3, and lack of expression of CD20 (a B cell lineage associated marker).Molecular clonality PCR (PARR) was performed using equine TRG primers; thisrevealed a clonal rearrangement in a heavy polyclonal background. Transmissionelectronic microscopy showed multiple lymphocytes with convoluted or cerebriform nuclei. CONCLUSIONS: This case report provides the first evidence of clinical,histopathological, immunophenotypic features, electron microscopy findings andmolecular analysis of a cutaneous epitheliotropic T-cell lymphoma (mycosisfungoides) in a donkey. Our observations suggest that cutaneous T-cell lymphomashould be included in the differential diagnoses of exfoliative dermatitis, even those progressing in a chronic pattern and/or with few or no pruritus.

AB  - PURPOSE: Fluoroquinolone toxicity studies in animals (cats, rabbits and mice)showed that acute retinal degenerations appear clinically related tophototoxicity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the administration of oral fluoroquinolone and the onset of clinically orsubclinically detectable acute retinal degeneration in humans. MATERIAL ANDMETHODS: This study included patients that received oral fluoroquinolonetreatment (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) for variable systemicdiseases diagnosed by the Department of Urology and Infectious Diseases (studygroup, n=76), and age and sex matched otherwise healthy subjects (control group, n=50). All the subjects underwent a detailed ophthalmologic examination includingtests for visual acuity, intraocular pressures, color vision, photostressrecovery time and contrast sensitivity measurements, central foveal thickness,subfoveal choroidal thickness, ganglion cell complex thickness and 10/2 Humphrey visual field test. Color fundus and fundus autofluorescence photographs were alsoobtained. Examinations and tests were repeated at 1st week and 1st month in thestudy group. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference amongvisual acuity, intraocular pressure, photostress recovery time, color vision,contrast sensitivity measurements, central foveal thickness, subfoveal choroidal thickness, average ganglion cell complex thickness, superior ganglion cellcomplex thickness, inferior ganglion cell complex thickness, focal loss volume,global loss volume, mean deviation, pattern standard deviation values intreatment group at baseline, 1st week and 1st month (p > 0.05, for the comparisonof each parameters). There was not any alteration among color fundus and fundusautofluorescence photographs obtained at baseline, 1st week and 1st month intreatment group. All parameters within the study and control groups were similar throughout the study period (p > 0.05, for the comparison of each parameter).CONCLUSION: This study evaluated the association between the administration oforal fluoroquinolone and the onset of acute retinal degeneration. Preliminaryresults of this study showed that use of oral fluoroquinolone had no detectableimpact on retinal degeneration at acute phase.

TI  - Molecular and serological detection of Toxoplasma gondii infection in mammals in the Taipei Zoo.
LID - 10.1111/zph.12987 [doi]
AB  - Toxoplasmosis caused by Toxoplasma gondii affects both conservation and publichealth efforts. In the Taipei Zoo, toxoplasmosis was diagnosed in ring-tailedlemurs and a meerkat in 2019 while a freeze-thaw meat strategy had been appliedto carnivores before the event. To investigate the possible risk factorsassociated with T. gondii infection in the Taipei Zoo, 179 veterinary visitingmammals from 2019-2021 and six stray cats were included to detect anti-T. gondii IgG and IgM in their serum via ELISA, and T. gondii in their faeces and blood viaPCR. Although the overall T. gondii IgG seroprevalence was 33.5% and PCRpositivity was 16.2% in the zoo mammals, the correlation between T. gondii PCRand systemic IgG results was low. An omnivorous diet (adjusted OR = 0.4; 95% CI: 0.2-1.0), a herbivorous diet (adjusted OR = 3.2; 95% CI: 1.1-9.6), and animals inthe Conservation Area where stray cats appeared (adjusted OR = 18.3; 95% CI:3.9-85.9) were independent risk factors for T. gondii infection. The low T.gondii-specific IgM positivity (0.6%) suggests that most animals did not haveacute T. gondii infection. In conclusion, our findings indirectly support thatfeeding frozen meat to carnivores, cleaning fresh food, and restricting access tostray cats to prevent faecal contaminants could prevent animals from T. gondiiexposure.

TI  - Seroprevalence of toxocariasis among allergic patients in Kuwait and itsassociation with eosinophilia.
PG  - e00260
LID - 10.1016/j.parepi.2022.e00260 [doi]
AB  - Toxocariasis is a worldwide helminthic infection which is transmitted frominfected dogs and cats and has been associated with peripheral bloodeosinophilia. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) placedtoxocariasis among the top 6 parasitic diseases in the USA which are prioritized for public health action. To our knowledge, there are no reports on humantoxocariasis in Kuwait or in the other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. This study aims at investigating the seroprevalence of toxocariasis amongallergic patients in Kuwait and its association with eosinophilia, age, gender,nationality, and history of direct contact with dogs or cats. From September toDecember 2021, the laboratory records of allergic patients referred to Al-Rashed Allergy Hospital, Kuwait were reviewed and a total of 400 serum samples wereselected: 200 samples from patients with normal eosinophil count (< 500cells/mul) and 200 samples from patients with eosinophilia (> 500 cells/mul). Thesera were screened for anti-Toxocara canis IgG antibodies via antibodyenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Ab-ELISA). The seropositive patients wereasked about their history of direct contact with dogs or cats. Statisticalanalyses were performed using Microsoft Excel(R) Analysis ToolPak software.Toxocariasis seropositivity was detected in 10 out of 400 (2.5%) allergicpatients. Five patients had eosinophilia while 5 had normal eosinophil count.There was no difference in mean age or gender between Toxocara-seropositive andseronegative patients (p > 0.05). The seroprevalence rate was lower-than-expectedamong Kuwaiti patients (2/307, 0.7%) in comparison with non-Kuwaiti patients(8/57, 14.0%) (chi2 = 33.603, df = 1, p < 0.001) who originated from endemicSouth/Southeast Asian countries. Seven out of 8 (87.5%) seropositive patients hada history of direct contact with cats, dogs, or both. The seroprevalence rate of toxocariasis among allergic patients in Kuwait was 2.5%. Raising awareness andearly deworming treatment/prophylaxis for juvenile dogs and cats remain crucialfor toxocariasis prevention.

TI  - Standardized allergen extracts for allergen immunotherapy.
PG  - 327-332
LID - 10.2500/aap.2022.43.220015 [doi]
AB  - Nineteen U.S. allergen extracts were standardized by the U.S. Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) between 1987 and 1998, including of two house-dust mites,short ragweed, cat hair and cat pelt, seven temperate and one southern grass, andsix Hymenoptera venom preparations. Relevant literature was reviewed. For eachallergen, a "representative" extract was established; the potency of eachrepresentative extract was determined by measurement of the total protein content(Hymenoptera venom), radial diffusion measurement of the dominant allergen (shortragweed and cat), or, if there was no dominant allergen, then by quantitativeskin testing by using the ID50EAL (intradermal dilution for 50 mm sum of erythemadetermines the bioequivalent allergy units) method. In vitro tests were developedto allow the manufacturer to demonstrate that each lot of its extract wasstatistically identical, within defined limits, to the FDA reference extract.These tests included radial immunodiffusion, competitive enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay, and isoelectric focusing. The standardized extracts offerthe advantage of consistent potency from lot to lot for each manufacturer andalso from manufacturer to manufacturer, and assure the presence of recognizedsignificant allergens within the extract. Therefore, standardized extracts offer improved safety and efficacy over their nonstandardized predecessors.

TI  - Review and statistical analysis of clinical management of feline leishmaniosiscaused by Leishmania infantum.
PG  - 253
LID - 10.1186/s13071-022-05369-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is limited information about feline leishmaniosis (FeL)management in clinical practice. Leishmania infantum is the species of Leishmaniamost frequently reported in both dogs and cats in countries of the Mediterranean region (henceforth 'Mediterranean countries'), Central and South America, andIran. This study was conducted to provide veterinary clinicians with an updatedoverview of evidence-based information on leishmaniosis in cats. METHODS: Areview was performed using PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar and Web ofScience. Case reports of FeL caused by L. infantum were sought for the period1912 to 1 June 2021. RESULTS: Sixty-three case reports are included in thisreview. Fifty-nine out of the 63 cats were from Europe, mostly from Mediterraneancountries (88.9%). Most of them were domestic short-haired cats (90%) with a meanage of 7.9 years, and had access to the outdoors (77.3%). Sixty-six percent ofthe cats had comorbidities, of which feline immunodeficiency virus infection was the most frequent (37.7%). Dermatological lesions (69.8%) was the most frequentclinical sign, and hyperproteinemia (46.3%) the most frequent clinicopathologicalabnormality. Serology was the most performed diagnostic method (76.2%) and waspositive for 93.7% of cats. Medical treatment was applied in 71.4% of cats, andallopurinol was the most used drug (74.4%). Survival time was greater for treatedcats (520 days; 71.4% of cats) than non-treated cats (210 days; 25.4%).CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the cats had comorbidities, of which felineimmunodeficiency virus was the most frequent. Dermatological lesions werefrequently reported, and systemic clinical signs and clinicopathologicalabnormalities were also common. Serology may be useful for the diagnosis of FeLin clinical practice, and a positive titer of >/= 1/40 may be a useful cut-offfor sick cats. The reported treatments and dosages varied, but there was a goodclinical response and longer survival in most of the cats treated withallopurinol monotherapy.

AB  - Pythiosis is an endemic disease in northeastern Brazil and we now report theepidemiological, clinical and pathological findings in a retrospective study ofnaturally occurring cases in domestic animals. From January 1985 to December2020, the Laboratory of Animal Pathology of the Federal University of CampinaGrande examined 13,542 tissue samples from necropsies and biopsies. Among thesesamples, 306 were diagnosed as pythiosis: 195 cases in horses, 75 in sheep, 19 indogs, six in mules, four in cattle, three in cats, two in goats, one in a donkey and one in an ostrich. Affected equids had lesions in the skin, mammary glandsand nasal cavities. Affected sheep had cutaneous, nasal and digestive lesionswhile cattle and goats had cutaneous lesions. Carnivores developed lesions,mainly in the alimentary tract, of sufficient severity to cause death or resultin euthanasia. The single affected bird had lesions in the alimentary tract andsurgical excision resulted in remission. The disease had a long andlife-threatening clinical course in most affected species but resolvedspontaneously in cattle. Clinical signs were directly related to the location of the lesions, which were invariably characterized by chronic inflammationassociated with intralesional hyphae. Veterinary clinicians and pathologistsshould be familiar with the clinicopathological features of pythiosis and thewide range of susceptible animal species.

TI  - Pet ownership, loneliness, and social isolation: a systematic review.
LID - 10.1007/s00127-022-02332-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Several publications explored a relationship between pet ownership andlower levels of loneliness and social isolation. However, to the best of ourknowledge, no systematic review has yet synthesized the evidence on theseassociations. Thus, this systematic review aims to evaluate the findingsregarding the relations between pet ownership, loneliness, and social isolation. METHODS: PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycInfo were searched in January 2022.Observational studies relying on appropriate instruments to assess the exposureand the outcome variables were included. Two reviewers independently executedstudy selection, data extraction, and quality assessment. RESULTS: n = 24 studieswere included. Among adult samples, the studies examining the relationshipbetween pet ownership and social isolation found that owning a pet was associatedwith lower levels of social isolation. Concerning loneliness, studies that wereconducted after the outbreak of COVID-19 mostly showed that pet ownership cancontribute to lower levels of loneliness, but did not reveal an overallsignificant association until then. In turn, the studies that examined child and adolescent samples suggest that pet ownership was related to reduced lonelinessbefore COVID-19. Furthermore, most of the studies did not reveal any differences between dogs, cats, and other kinds of pets regarding their relationship toloneliness and social isolation. CONCLUSION: All in all, only a part of thestudies detected a significant association between pet ownership, loneliness and social isolation. However, the COVID-19 pandemic seemed to strengthen thisrelationship, so that future research is required to assess the longevity of thispotential effect.

TI  - Googling for a veterinary diagnosis: A replication study using Google as adiagnostic aid.
PG  - 1466-1470
LID - 10.1111/jvim.16484 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to replicate in the veterinary context a BMJ study using Google to assist in diagnosis of complex cases.HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To assess percentage of diagnoses identified using Google as a diagnostic aid in veterinary medicine. ANIMALS: None; 13 cases in cats and17 in dogs published in JAVMA. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey of Google results from searches using keywords generated independently by a generalist and aspecialist veterinarian who reviewed the published case history and diagnosticcomponents while blind to the diagnosis. They offered diagnoses and generated up to 5 search strategies for each case. The top 30 Google results for each searchwere reviewed by the generalist to inform a final Google-aided diagnosis. Bothveterinarians' initial diagnoses and the Google-aided diagnoses were comparedwith the published diagnoses. RESULTS: Google searching led to 52 diagnoses outof 60 possible. Twenty-two (42%, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 29%-55%)Google-aided diagnoses matched the JAVMA diagnosis. This accuracy rate does notdiffer significantly from 58% (n = 15/26, 95% CI 38%-77%) identified in the BMJstudy. Google-aided results were not statistically different from those achieved unaided by each veterinarian (33%, 95% CI 16%-50%). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICALIMPORTANCE: Published information found searching Google using keywords relatedto complicated or unusual cases could assist veterinarians to reinforce theirinitial diagnosis or consider other differential diagnoses. Search strategiesusing words representing either signs or the preliminary diagnoses can yieldresults useful to confirming a correct diagnosis.

TI  - Sublingual papillomas of cheetahs in southern Africa.
PG  - 3009858221109610
LID - 10.1177/03009858221109610 [doi]
AB  - Nine distinct papillomaviruses (Lambdapapillomavirus) have been described indomestic and nondomestic cats, but not in cheetahs. These viruses have beenassociated with cutaneous papillomas or plaques, bowenoid in situ carcinomas,feline cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), feline sarcoids, and oral (oftensublingual) papillomas. Fourteen cheetahs from the AfriCat foundation (Namibia)and one from the Ann van Dyk Cheetah center (South Africa) presented withsublingual lesions reminiscent of sublingual papillomas. Two animals werebiopsied and the histopathology revealed benign proliferative epithelial lesions with prominent thickening of the overlying squamous epithelium. Throughout thesquamous epithelial layers were cells with nuclear enlargement, irregularity ofthe nuclear membranes and cell contours, focal hyperchromasia of the nuclei, and perinuclear halos, reminiscent of a virus-associated process as seen inpapillomavirus infections. Thirteen more cheetahs were sampled and the tissuesnap frozen for molecular characterization. Amplification and sequencing of thepapillomavirus L1, E6, E7, and E1 gene regions was achieved with modifiedprimers. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses revealed all 15 cheetahpapilloma samples were 99.99% genetically similar and closely related to, butgenetically distinct from any known felinepapillomaviruses. All cheetahs were FIVand FeLV negative. The results suggest the samples identified in this study canbe considered a previously undescribed or novel feline papillomavirus and theauthors propose "Acinonyx jubatus papillomavirus type 1" (AjPV-1), within theLambdapapillomavirus 1 genus (Family: Papillomaviridae).

PG  - 1454-1459
LID - 10.1111/jvim.16471 [doi]
AB  - CASE DESCRIPTION: A 10-month-old castrated male domestic longhair cat wasevaluated for increasing frequency of episodic limb rigidity. CLINICAL FINDINGS: The cat presented for falling over and lying recumbent with its limbs inextension for several seconds when startled or excited. Upon examination, the cathad hypertrophied musculature, episodes of facial spasm, and a short-strided,stiff gait. DIAGNOSTICS: Electromyography (EMG) identified spontaneous dischargesthat waxed and waned in amplitude and frequency, consistent with myotonicdischarges. A high impact 8-base pair (bp) deletion across the end of exon 3 and intron 3 of the chloride voltage-gated channel 1 (CLCN1) gene was identifiedusing whole genome sequencing. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: Phenytoin treatment wasinitiated at 3 mg/kg po q24 h and resulted in long-term improvement. CLINICALRELEVANCE: This novel mutation within the CLCN1 gene is a cause of myotoniacongenita in cats and we report for the first time its successful treatment.

TI  - 3D printed cannulas for use in laparoscopic surgery in feline patients: Acadaveric study and case series.
LID - 10.1111/vsu.13849 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate custom 3D printed laparoscopic cannulas (3DPC) in a felinecadaveric abdominal surgery model and report their use in two live felinesubjects. STUDY DESIGN: Experimental cadaver study, live subject case series.ANIMALS: Ten feline cadavers; two feline subjects. METHODS: Custom 3DPCs wereinitially modeled in a PLA filament material and then created in an autoclavable dental resin for use in live patients. The surgery time, number of surgicalcollisions and cannula complications were recorded during cadaver proceduresbefore and after use of 3DPCs. Cannula complications were recorded during liveprocedures and patients were followed to suture removal to record any incisional complications. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in mean surgical time(125.6 vs. 95.2 min, p = 0.03), mean number of instrument collisions (6.8 vs.2.6, p = 0.03), and mean number of cannula complications (10 vs. 2.2, p = 0.03)with the use of only 3DPCs during the procedure. During the live procedures theuse of the 3DPCs was successful and no postoperative complications occurred atthe incision sites. CONCLUSION: The use of customized 3DPCs may improve surgical dexterity and decrease complications in advanced procedures and was notassociated with any clinical complications in two cats. The use of 3DPCs inveterinary medicine may allow for wider practice of laparoscopic techniques insmall animals.

AB  - Pasteurella multocida is a small facultative anaerobic Gram-negativecoccobacillus. Bites or scratches from cats or dogs are common transmission routecausing zoonotic infections in humans. The pathogen rarely cause prosthetic jointinfection. We report the first case, to our knowledge, of a prosthetic jointinfection in a patient underwent liver transplantation caused by this pathogen.Pasteurella multocida is a high pace growing pathogen. Physician should raiseawareness with related history especially in patients with immunosuppressivestatus. Management with the proper antibiotics administration in conjunction withtimely surgical intervention could prevent devastating complications and preservethe artificial joint.

PG  - 938154
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.938154 [doi]
AB  - Hepatitis B is an infectious hepatocellular disease of global concern caused byhepatitis B virus (HBV), which belongs to Hepadnaviridae. Recently, a novelHBV-like virus, domestic cat hepadnavirus (DCH), was detected from animmunocompromised cat with a hepatic disease in Australia. Subsequent molecularinvestigation by independent research groups revealed that its prevalence rateswere 6.5% in Australia, 10.8% in Italy, 12.4% in Thailand, 12.3% in Malaysia,3.08% in the United Kingdom, and 0.78% in Japan. Although the correlation betweenDCH infection and hepatic diseases remains to be elucidated, understanding thediversity of circulating DCH will contribute to its prevention and control indomestic cats. Herein, we summarize the current epidemiological data of DCH inthese countries.

AB  - Feline idiopathic cystitis is a widespread disease in small animal clinics, whichmainly presents with urinary signs like dysuria, stranguria, hematuria,pollakiuria, and periuria. The etiopathogenesis of the disease may involveinteractions between the environmental stressors, neuroendocrine system andbladder of affected cats. Diagnostic biomarkers have not been tested in clinical studies though they are theoretically feasible, and since the clinical signs ofthe disease assemble those of other feline lower urinary diseases, its diagnosis is a procedure of exclusion. The primary treatment of the disease is long-termmultimodal environmental modification (or enrichment) while anti-anxiety drugsand nutritional supplements are recommended for chronic recurrent cases. Still,many medicines need to be evaluated for their efficacy and safety. This reviewaims to provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of feline idiopathiccystitis by summarizing and updating studies concerning the prevalence, riskfactors, etiological hypotheses, diagnostic procedures, possible treatments, and prognosis of the disease.

TI  - Prevalence and Molecular Characterization of Toxoplasma gondii and Toxocara cati Among Stray and Household Cats and Cat Owners in Tehran, Iran.

AB  - Toxoplasma gondii and Toxocara spp. are the most critical parasites commonbetween humans and cats. The close association of cats with humans in urban areaspersuaded us to investigate the prevalence of these parasites in stray andhousehold cats and their possible role in the owners' infection. Herein, 132 and 33 fecal samples of stray and household cats, respectively, and 33 blood samples of their owners were collected in Tehran, Iran. The prevalence of T. gondii wasdetermined by targeting the B1 gene in the feces of stray and household cats and the blood of cat owners. Furthermore, genotypes of T. gondii were identifiedbased on the multilocus genotyping of BTUB, GRA6, SAG3, and APICO loci. Toxocara spp. were detected by targeting the second internal transcribed spacer (ITS-2) ofthe ribosomal DNA of these parasites in the cats' feces and the humans' blood.Also, Toxocara IgG was assessed in the human serum samples. The B1 geneamplification showed that 15.2% of stray cats, 18.2% of household cats, and 51.5%of cat owners were infected with T. gondii. The multilocus sequence analysisrevealed the predominance of genotype I of T. gondii in stray cats and genotypeII of T. gondii in household cats and cat owners. The amplifying of ITS-2revealed a high prevalence of T. cati infection (47.0%) in stray cats, whereas noinfection was found in the feces of household cats or the serum of cat owners.Likewise, Toxocara IgG was not detected in the serum of humans. The lowerprevalence of T. gondii in stray/household cats than in the cat owners indicates the limited impact of close contact with infected cats in human toxoplasmosis.However, the high prevalence of T. cati infection in stray cats can causecontamination of the environment by excreting eggs that may lead to infectinghumans through soil or water. Therefore, public health education in urbanmanagement planning is necessary for routine urban cat deworming programs and fortraining the healthcare workers to prevent, control, and treat these infections.

TI  - The Impact of Incorporating Multiple Best Practices on Live Outcomes for aMunicipal Animal Shelter in Memphis, TN.
PG  - 786866
LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.786866 [doi]
AB  - Modern animal shelters are encouraged to adopt "best practices" intended topromote life-saving for the animals that enter their systems. While these bestpractices have been defined and widely promoted within the profession, fewstudies have tracked how making the recommended changes affects live releaserates (LRR) and other shelter metrics. In 2017, the municipal animal shelter inMemphis, TN (Memphis Animal Services) implemented five new strategies andanalyzed their resultant life-saving data. The interventions included managedstrategic shelter intake, pet owner safety net, community cat return to field,transition of field services from punitive to assistive, and streamlined adoptionand transfer protocols. The median LRR for cats prior to 2017 was 35% (IQR 22,36). After the intervention, the LRR increased to a median of 92% (IQR 92, 94).The correlation between intake and euthanasia for cats prior to the intervention was significant (P < 0.001) and very strong (r = 0.982), while after there was norelationship (-0.165) and it was not significant (P = 0.791). The median LRR for dogs prior to 2017 was 25% (IQR 19, 48). After the intervention, the LRRincreased to a median of 87% (IQR 86, 88). The correlation between intake andeuthanasia for dogs prior to the intervention was significant (P < 0.001) andvery strong (r = 0.991), while after there was a moderate relationship (-0.643)that was not significant (P = 0.242). The median LRR for kittens prior to 2017was 34% (IQR 23, 38), which increased (P = 0.001) to 92% (IQR 91, 92) afterintervention. The percent of kittens entering the shelter with an outcome ofeuthanasia decreased (P < 0.001), from a median of 59% (IQR 54, 73) to a medianof 3% (IQR 1, 3). The median return to owner (RTO) rate for dogs increased (P =0.007) from 10% (IQR 9, 11) to 13% (IQR 13, 13). Implementation of these bestpractices accelerated Memphis Animal Services' progress toward a live releaserate of at least 90%, particularly for cats, dramatically decreased kitteneuthanasia, increased the RTO rate for dogs and severed the historicalcorrelation between euthanasia and intake.

LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.887163 [doi]
AB  - Biomarker discovery using biobank samples collected from veterinary clinics woulddeliver insights into the diverse population of pets and accelerate diagnosticdevelopment. The acquisition, preparation, processing, and storage of biofluidsamples in sufficient volumes and at a quality suitable for later analysis withmost suitable discovery methods remain challenging. Metabolomics analysis is avaluable approach to detect health/disease phenotypes. Pre-processing changesduring preparation of plasma/serum samples may induce variability that may beovercome using dried blood spots (DBSs). We report a proof of principle study by metabolite fingerprinting applying UHPLC-MS of plasma and DBSs acquired fromhealthy adult dogs and cats (age range 1-9 years), representing each of 4 dogbreeds (Labrador retriever, Beagle, Petit Basset Griffon Vendeen, and Norfolkterrier) and the British domestic shorthair cat (n = 10 per group). Blood samples(20 and 40 muL) for DBSs were loaded onto filter paper, air-dried at roomtemperature (3 h), and sealed and stored (4 degrees C for ~72 h) prior to storageat -80 degrees C. Plasma from the same blood draw (250 muL) was prepared andstored at -80 degrees C within 1 h of sampling. Metabolite fingerprinting of the DBSs and plasma produced similar numbers of metabolite features that had similar abilities to discriminate between biological classes and correctly assign blindedsamples. These provide evidence that DBSs, sampled in a manner amenable toapplication in in-clinic/in-field processing, are a suitable sample for biomarkerdiscovery using UHPLC-MS metabolomics. Further, given appropriate owner consent, the volumes tested (20-40 muL) make the acquisition of remnant blood from bloodsamples drawn for other reasons available for biobanking and other researchactivities. Together, this makes possible large-scale biobanking of veterinarysamples, gaining sufficient material sooner and enabling quicker identificationof biomarkers of interest.

AB  - Inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy (IMPN) is one of the causes of sudden onsetof neuromuscular signs such as para-/tetraparesis in young cats. Even though mostcases have a favorable outcome, persistent deficits, relapses, and progressivecourses are occasionally seen. As clinical presentation does not always appear topredict outcome and risk of recurrence, this study was initiated to screen forprognostic biopsy findings in a large cohort of histologically confirmed IMPNcases with clinical follow-up. In total, nerve and muscle specimens of 107 catswith biopsy diagnosis of presumed autoreactive inflammatory polyneuropathy and 22control cases were reviewed by two blinded raters for a set of 36 histologicalparameters. To identify patterns and subtypes of IMPN, hierarchical k-meansclustering of 33 histologic variables was performed. Then, the impact ofhistological parameters on IMPN outcome was evaluated via an univariate analysis to identify variables for the final multivariate model. The data on immediateoutcome and follow-up were collected from submitting neurologists using apurpose-designed questionnaire. Hierarchical k-means clustering sorted thetissues into 4 main categories: cluster 1 (44/129) represents a purelyinflammatory IMPN picture, whereas cluster 2 (47/129) was accompanied bydemyelinating features and cluster 3 (16/129) by Wallerian degeneration. Cluster 4 (22/129) reflects normal tissues from non-neuropathic control cats. Returnedquestionnaires provided detailed information on outcome in 63 animals. They were categorized into recovered and non-recovered. Thereby, fiber-invasive infiltratesby mononuclear cells and mild fiber loss in intramuscular nerve branchescorrelated with higher probabilities of recovery. Remyelination in semithinsections, on the other hand, is correlated with a less favorable outcome. Animalsgrouping in cluster 1 had a tendency to a higher probability of recovery comparedto other clusters. In conclusion, diagnosis of feline IMPN from nerve and muscle biopsies allowed for the identification of histologic features that werepositively or negatively correlated with outcome.

AB  - The Japanese Veterinary Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (JVARM) wasestablished for nationwide monitoring of antimicrobial-resistant bacteriaisolated from animals. Here, antimicrobial resistance of Escherichia coli andEnterococcus spp. isolates from diseased and healthy dogs and cats wasinvestigated. Isolates were collected from diseased dogs and cats and fromhealthy dogs and cats in 2018 to 2020. Minimum inhibitory concentrations weredetermined for 1873 E. coli and 1383 Enterococcus spp. isolates. E. coli isolateswere most commonly resistant to nalidixic acid [diseased dog (DD), 62.1%;diseased cat (DC), 59.9%; healthy dog (HD), 23.5%; healthy cat (HC, 24.0%] andampicillin (DD, 54.4%; DC, 64.1%; HD, 28.4%; HC, 25.2%), followed byciprofloxacin (DD, 45.0%; DC, 44.0%; HD, 12.9%; HC, 10.4%). Enterococcus spp.isolates were most resistant to tetracycline (DD, 66.9%; DC, 67.8%; HD, 47.0%;HC, 52.0%), followed by erythromycin (DD, 43.2%; DC, 46.6%; HD, 27.8%; HC, 34.0%)and ciprofloxacin (DD, 27.9%; DC, 43.7%; HD, 9.7%; HC 12.9%). Only a few E. coli isolates were resistant to colistin and none were resistant to meropenem. Also,none of the Enterococcus spp. isolates we have tested were resistant tovancomycin. The significantly higher resistance rates of E. coli and Enterococcusspp. isolates from diseased, as opposed to healthy, dogs and cats against most ofthe tested antimicrobials indicates that the use of antimicrobials could selectresistant E. coli and Enterococcus spp.

AB  - Case summary: An 11-year-old male neutered domestic shorthair cat was presentedwith a 4-week history of an intermittent cough and dyspnoea. A pleural effusionwas identified, which was confirmed as chyle. Echocardiography and CT revealed a 16 mm mass cranial to the heart, which was invading the cranial vena cava.Because of the location of the mass, it was assumed that chylothorax haddeveloped as a result of direct disruption of the thoracic duct by the tumour or secondarily to central venous hypertension. An exploratory thoracotomy wasperformed, and the mass, which originated within the wall of the cranial venacava, was excised with narrow gross margins. Histopathology andimmunohistochemistry were consistent with a chemodectoma with residual tumourcells at the surgical margin. Given the residual microscopic disease, adjuvanttreatment with toceranib phosphate was initiated. The cat remained well for theduration of treatment and was euthanased 31 months after diagnosis when CTidentified recurrent pleural effusion, a heart base mass with cranial vena cavaand azygos vein invasion. Relevance and novel information: Chemodectomas are rarein cats, with only 13 cases reported in the literature to date, and all werelocated in either the aortic or carotid body. The reported survival with partial resection and/or subtotal pericardiectomy was 13-19 months. Treatment of felinechemodectomas with toceranib phosphate has not been previously reported. To ourknowledge, this is the first description of the surgical management of a felinevena cava chemodectoma, combined with adjuvant toceranib phosphate, resulting in a prolonged survival.

TI  - Evaluation of presentation, treatment and outcome in hypertensive emergency indogs and cats: 15 cases (2003-2019).
LID - 10.1111/jsap.13530 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Hypertensive emergency is well recognised in human medicine, yetthere is limited veterinary evidence. This study aimed to determine thepresentation, treatment and outcome in dogs and cats with hypertensive emergency.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective case series of dogs and cats withhypertensive emergency identified as follows: acute history with non-invasiveDoppler systolic blood pressure greater than 180 mmHg and target organ damageincluding acute onset seizures, altered mentation with or without lateralrecumbency or blindness. Data collected included signalment, history, physicalexamination and clinicopathological findings, systolic blood pressure,antihypertensive treatment and outcome. RESULTS: Seven dogs and eight cats wereincluded presenting with seizures (n=9), blindness (n=4), altered mentation with (n=2) or without (n=2) lateral recumbency. Median age was 9 years (range 1 to 15)and duration of clinical signs before presentation was 1.5 days (range 1 to 15). Median systolic blood pressure on presentation was 230 mmHg (range 190 to 300).Amlodipine was the most common first-line agent (n=10), followed by hydralazine(n=4) and hypertonic saline (n=1). Aetiology of hypertensive emergency was acute kidney injury (n=9), idiopathic hypertension (n=3), hyperthyroidism (n=1),lymphoma (n=1) and suspected cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy (n=1).Five cats and three dogs survived to discharge with an overall survival of 53.3%.CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Hypertensive emergencies had various presenting signs inthis series. AKI was considered to be the cause of hypertension in the majorityof patients. Further evaluation of treatment for hypertensive emergencies iswarranted, considering almost half of the cases did not survive to discharge.

AB  - Studies on primate sense of smell are scarce, even though odours represent themain communicative channel for many nocturnal primates such as gray slenderlorises (Loris lydekkerianus). Here, we investigate the influence of naturalodours on communicative and social behaviours on a group of slender loriseshoused at the Frankfurt Zoo. Previously collected chemical marks from unknownconspecifics, urine from a natural predator (rusty-spotted cats) and a controlsetup were introduced in random order to the group enclosure. We recordedchemical communication behaviours, such as marking and sniffing, socialbehaviours and general activities. Using generalized linear mixed-effect models, we found that the odours did not have an effect on marking, but on sniffingbehaviours of the animals. Conspecific odours decreased the sniffing frequencies of the animals (especially shortly after introduction). When predator odours wereintroduced, sniffing increased when compared to treatments with conspecificodours, but not in comparison to control treatments. The frequency of socialbehaviours, feeding and self-grooming did not change in response to predator orconspecific odours. Despite some limitations to our study, the data show a trend that natural odours may trigger some interest in group-kept slender lorises, and further examination of other novel odours may be worth studying (e.g. forpotential chemical enrichment in zoos).

AB  - As tick-borne diseases continue to increase across North America, currentresearch strives to understand how the tick microbiome may affect pathogenacquisition, maintenance, and transmission. Prior high throughput amplicon-based microbial diversity surveys of the widespread tick Dermacentor variabilis havesuggested that life stage, sex, and geographic region may influence thecomposition of the tick microbiome. Here, adult D. variabilis ticks (n = 145)were collected from dogs and cats from 32 states with specimens originating from all four regions of the United States (West, Midwest, South, and Northeast), and the tick microbiome was examined via V4-16S rRNA gene amplification and Illumina sequencing. A total of 481,246 bacterial sequences were obtained (median 2924 persample, range 399-11,990). Fifty genera represented the majority (>80%) of thesequences detected, with the genera Allofrancisella and Francisella being themost abundant. Further, 97%, 23%, and 5.5% of the ticks contained sequencesbelonging to Francisella spp., Rickettsia spp., and Coxiella spp., respectively. No Ehrlichia spp. or Anaplasma spp. were identified. Co-occurrence analysis, byway of correlation coefficients, between the top 50 most abundant generademonstrated five strong positive and no strong negative correlationrelationships. Geographic region had a consistent effect on species richness withticks from the Northeast having a significantly greater level of richness. Alpha diversity patterns were dependent on tick sex, with males exhibiting higherlevels of diversity, and geographical region, with higher level of diversityobserved in ticks obtained from the Northeast, but not on tick host. Communitystructure, or beta diversity, of tick microbiome was impacted by tick sex andgeographic location, with microbiomes of ticks from the western US exhibiting adistinct community structure when compared to those from the other three regions (Northeast, South, and Midwest). In total, LEfSe (Linear discriminant analysisEffect Size) identified 18 specific genera driving these observed patterns ofdiversity and community structure. Collectively, these findings highlight thedifferences in bacterial diversity of D. variabilis across the US and supportsthe interpretation that tick sex and geographic region affects microbiomecomposition across a broad sampling distribution.

AB  - Cat allergy is a major trigger factor for respiratory reactions (asthma andrhinitis) in patients with immunoglobulin E (IgE) sensitization. In this study,we used a comprehensive panel of purified cat allergen molecules (rFel d 1, nFel d 2, rFel d 3, rFel d 4, rFel d 7, and rFel d 8) that were obtained byrecombinant expression in Escherichia coli or by purification as natural proteinsto study possible associations with different phenotypes of cat allergy (i.e.,rhinitis, conjunctivitis, asthma, and dermatitis) by analyzing molecular IgErecognition profiles in a representative cohort of clinically well-characterized adult cat allergic subjects (n = 84). IgE levels specific to each of the allergenmolecules and to natural cat allergen extract were quantified by ImmunoCAPmeasurements. Cumulative IgE levels specific to the cat allergen moleculescorrelated significantly with IgE levels specific to the cat allergen extract,indicating that the panel of allergen molecules resembled IgE epitopes of thenatural allergen source. rFel d 1 represented the major cat allergen, which wasrecognized by 97.2% of cat allergic patients; however, rFel d 3, rFel d 4, andrFel d 7 each showed IgE reactivity in more than 50% of cat allergic patients,indicating the importance of additional allergens in cat allergy. Patients withcat-related skin symptoms showed a trend toward higher IgE levels and/orfrequencies of sensitization to each of the tested allergen molecules comparedwith patients suffering only from rhinitis or asthma, while there were no suchdifferences between patients with rhinitis and asthma. The IgE levels specific toallergen molecules, the IgE levels specific to cat allergen extract, and the IgE levels specific to rFel d 1 were significantly higher in patients with fourdifferent symptoms compared with patients with 1-2 symptoms. This difference was more pronounced for the sum of IgE levels specific to the allergen molecules and to cat extract than for IgE levels specific for rFel d 1 alone. Our studyindicates that, in addition to rFel d 1, rFel d 3, rFel d 4, and rFel d 7 must beconsidered as important cat allergens. Furthermore, the cumulative sum of IgElevels specific to cat allergen molecules seems to be a biomarker for identifyingpatients with complex phenotypes of cat allergy. These findings are important forthe diagnosis of IgE sensitization to cats and for the design ofallergen-specific immunotherapies for the treatment and prevention of catallergy.

TI  - Is Pet Health Insurance Able to Improve Veterinary Care? Why Pet Health Insurancefor Dogs and Cats Has Limits: An Ethical Consideration on Pet Health Insurance.
LID - 1728 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12131728 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Owners often feel the cost of veterinary care is too high, as thereremains a limited understanding of the cost of health care in human andveterinary medicine alike. Pet health insurance is often seen as a universalsolution. However, especially for patient owners with few financial resources,both the bill at the vet and the monthly premium for pet health insurance canbecome a challenge. HYPOTHESIS: Pet health insurance can prevent or ease manyprice discussions at the vet, but it does not offer a solution for patient ownerswith little financial means. METHODS: In order to verify for which patient ownerspet health insurance can be a solution, four theoretical groups were formeddepending on the patient owner's willingness to pay and his/her dispensable fundsbased on a theoretical model. RESULTS: Dispensable funds are a factor that cannotbe influenced by the veterinary surgeon. However, low dispensable funds as aresult of an insufficient willingness to save (whether due to a lack of financialeducation or a lack of will) can be solved by pet health insurance. Willingnessto pay, on the other hand, can be influenced by empathetic communication from theveterinary surgeon and thus also from pet health insurance. Nevertheless,situations remain where pet health insurance is not a solution either, becauseowners can neither afford the veterinary costs nor a premium for a pet healthinsurance.

TI  - Coexistence between Humans and 'Misunderstood' Domestic Cats in the Anthropocene:Exploring Behavioural Plasticity as a Gatekeeper of Evolution.
LID - 1717 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12131717 [doi]
AB  - Welfare and management decisions for unowned free-ranging cats in urbanenvironments should no longer be based on knowledge about behavioural ecology of solitary cats living and breeding in more natural 'wild' environments. We provideevidence that urban free-ranging domestic cats in the Anthropocene have respondedto rapidly changing environments, such as abundance of food and higher populationdensities of conspecifics by adapting their behaviour (behavioural plasticity-theability of a genotype (individual) to express different behaviours according toits environment) and social organisation to living in complex social groups,especially those living in colonies. Urban free-ranging cats are now more social,as demonstrated by different breeding patterns, lower infanticide, more frequent affiliative interactions in general, and different spatial groupings. We arguethat this knowledge should be disseminated widely, and inform future research andstrategies used to manage free-ranging cats across environments. Understandingbehavioural plasticity and other recently evolved traits of domestic cats maylead to management strategies that maximise health and welfare of cats, wildlife,and humans-otherwise domestic cat behaviour may be 'misunderstood'. Importantly, interdisciplinary research using expertise from biological and social sciences,and engaging human communities, should evaluate these management strategies toensure they maintain optimal welfare of free-ranging domestic cats whilepreserving biodiversity and protecting wildcats.

TI  - Gills Just Want to Have Fun: Can Fish Play Games, Just like Us?
LID - 1684 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12131684 [doi]
AB  - It is common to observe play in dogs, cats, and birds, but have we been ignoring play in one of the most common house pets of all... fish? Aquarium fish are oftenused as meditative decoration in family households, but it could be that fishhave similarly diverse behavioral repertoires as mammals and birds. To examinethis theory, we conducted field tests at local pet stores where a range ofaquarium fish species was tested for responsiveness to laser pointer stimuli. Outof 66 species of fish tested, over 80% showed a tendency to be interested in the moving laser spots, particularly red ones. Whether this behavior constitutes playis an active topic of investigation that we examine in this work.

TI  - Feeding Fiber-Bound Polyphenol Ingredients at Different Levels Modulates Colonic Postbiotics to Improve Gut Health in Cats.
LID - 1654 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12131654 [doi]
AB  - Consumption of fiber in its different forms can result in positive healtheffects. Prior studies in dogs found that addition of a fiber bundle (composed ofpecan shells, flax seed, and powders of cranberry, citrus, and beet) to foodresulted in a shift in fecal bacterial metabolism from proteolysis tosaccharolysis. The present study evaluated the changes in fecal metabolites andmicrobiota in healthy cats following the consumption of this fiber bundle.Following a 28-day pre-feed period, 56 healthy adult cats received food with noneor one of three concentrations (0%, 1%, 2%, and 4%) of the fiber bundle for a31-day period. In cats that consumed the 4% fiber bundle, levels of ammonium and fecal branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs) decreased from baseline and comparedwith the other groups. Addition of any level of the fiber bundle resulted inincreases in beneficial metabolites: polyphenols hesperidin, hesperetin,ponciretin, secoisolariciresinol diglucoside, secoisolariciresinol, andenterodiol. Little change in fecal microbiota was observed. Since higher levelsof ammonia and BCFAs indicate putrefactive metabolism, the decreases in thesewith the 4% fiber bundle indicate a shift toward saccharolytic metabolism despitelittle change in the microbiota composition.

LID - 1599 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12131599 [doi]
AB  - Biomarkers are essential in the characterization of neoplastic lesions and aidnot only in the classification of the nature of the lesions, but also in theunderstanding of their ontogeny, development and prognosis. In cats, whilemammary carcinomas are increasingly being characterized, information on theirbenign lesions is still scarce. Indeed, a better characterization of benignlesions could have an important role in unravelling mammary oncogenesis, similar to that in human breast cancer. Thus, in this study, the expression of fivemarkers was analyzed in 47 benign mammary lesions (hyperplasia, dysplasia andbenign tumors) collected from 27 queens. Dysplastic and hyperplastic lesions werethe most common (41/47, 81.7%). Most of the lesions were classified as ERpositive (43/47, 91.5%), PR negative (30/47, 63.8%), fHER2 negative (29/47,64.4%), CK 5/6 negative (36/47, 76.6%) and with a low Ki-67 index (37/47, 78.7%).Statistical analysis revealed a correlation between younger ages and ERpositivity (p = 0.013) and between larger lesions and negative PR status (p =0.038). These results reinforce the importance of evaluating the expression ofthe ER status, prevalent in benign lesions, as a putative precursor in cancerprogression.

TI  - A review of the neural control of micturition in dogs and cats: neuroanatomy,neurophysiology and neuroplasticity.
LID - 10.1007/s11259-022-09966-9 [doi]
AB  - This article discusses the current knowledge on the role of the neurologicalstructures, especially the cerebellum and the hypothalamus, and compares theinformation with human medicine. Micturition is a complex voluntary andinvoluntarily mechanism. Its physiological completion strictly depends on thehierarchical organisation of the central nervous system pathways in theperipheral nervous system. Although the role of the peripheral nervous system andsubcortical areas, such as brainstem centres, are well established in veterinary medicine, the role of the cerebellum and hypothalamus have been poorlyinvestigated and understood. Lower urinary tract dysfunction is often associated with neurological diseases that cause neurogenic bladder (NB). Theneuroplasticity of the nervous system in the developmental changes of themechanism of micturition during the prenatal and postnatal periods is alsoanalysed.

TI  - The cannabinoid receptors system in horses: Tissue distribution and cellularidentification in skin.
PG  - 1508-1524
LID - 10.1111/jvim.16467 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is composed of cannabinoid receptorstype 1 (CBR1) and type 2 (CBR2), cannabinoid-based ligands (endogenous chemicallysynthesized phytocannabinoids), and endogenous enzymes controlling theirconcentrations. Cannabinoid receptors (CBRs) have been identified ininvertebrates and in almost all vertebrate species in the central and peripheral nervous system as well as in immune cells, where they control neuroimmunehomeostasis. In humans, rodents, dogs, and cats, CBRs expression has beenconfirmed in the skin, and their expression and tissue distribution becomedisordered in pathological conditions. Cannabinoid receptors may be a possibletherapeutic target in skin diseases. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the distributionand cellular expression of CBRs in the skin of horses under normal conditions.ANIMALS: Fifteen healthy horses. METHODS: Using full-thickness skin punch biopsy samples, skin-derived primary epidermal keratinocytes and dermal-derived cells,we performed analysis of Cnr1 and Cnr2 genes using real-time PCR and CBR1 andCBR2 protein expression by confocal microscopy and Western blotting. RESULTS:Normal equine skin, including equine epidermal keratinocytes and dermalfibroblast-like cells, all exhibited constant gene and protein expression ofCBRs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Our results represent a starting pointfor developing and translating new veterinary medicine-based pharmacotherapiesusing ECS as a possible target.

TI  - Urinary extracellular vesicles as a source of protein-based biomarkers in feline chronic kidney disease and hypertension.
LID - 10.1111/jsap.13536 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To validate a methodology for isolating feline urinary extracellular vesicles and characterise the urinary extracellular vesicle population andproteome in cats with normal renal function and cats with normotensive orhypertensive chronic kidney disease. METHODS: Feline urinary extracellularvesicles were isolated using three different methods (precipitation alone,precipitation followed by size exclusion chromatography and ultrafiltrationfollowed by size exclusion chromatography, which were compared via transmissionelectron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis. Cats with normal renalfunction (n=9), normotensive chronic kidney disease (n=10) and hypertensivechronic kidney disease (n=9) were identified and urinary extracellular vesiclesisolated from patient urine samples via ultrafiltration followed by sizeexclusion chromatography. Extracellular vesicle size and concentration weredetermined using nanoparticle tracking analysis, and subsequently underwentproteomic analysis using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry toidentify differences in protein expression between categories. RESULTS: Urinaryextracellular vesicle preparations contained particles of the expected size andmorphology, and those obtained by ultrafiltration + size exclusion chromatographyhad a significantly higher purity (highest particle: protein ratio). The urinary extracellular vesicle proteomes contained extracellular vesicle markers andproteins originating from all nephron segments. Urinary extracellular vesicleconcentration and size were unaffected by renal disease or hypertension. Therewere no differentially expressed proteins detected when comparing urinaryextracellular vesicles derived from cats in the healthy category with thecombined chronic kidney disease category, but five differentially expressedproteins were identified between the normotensive chronic kidney disease andhypertensive chronic kidney disease categories. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Felineurinary extracellular vesicles can be successfully isolated from stored urinesamples. Differentially expressed urinary extracellular vesicle proteins werediscovered in cats with hypertensive chronic kidney disease, and warrant further investigation into their utility as biomarkers or therapeutic targets.

PG  - e20210142
LID - 10.3138/jvme-2021-0142 [doi]
AB  - Successful placement of intravenous catheters (IVC) is a basic and essentialclinical skill for veterinary students. The purposes of this study were todetermine the overall success rate for IVC placement in cats and dogs whenfinal-year veterinary students are performing the procedure in a clinicalsetting, to determine if self-assessed experience level affects IVC placementsuccess rates, and to identify factors affecting student success with thisprocedure. Final-year students were asked to complete an anonymous surveyfollowing each catheter placement attempt during their 3-week core emergencymedicine rotation. The survey included self-assessed level of experience, patientspecies, indication for IVC placement, restrainer, catheter type, insertion site,use of sedation, and perceived degree of coaching. Success or failure in catheterplacement was recorded and two attempts were allowed. A Chi-square test was used to evaluate differences between insertion outcomes in dogs and cats. A univariatelogistic regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between success and all other variables. A total of 256 catheters were attempted by students,with an overall success rate of 61%. The cephalic vein was associated withsuccessful placement compared with the saphenous vein (p = .005). There was norelationship between successful catheter placement and self-assessed experience, species, indication for IVC placement, insertion site, use of sedation, catheter type, or restrainer. Final-year veterinary students do not master intravenouscatheterization in the emergency room setting, and additional studies arerequired to improve clinical instruction in this area.

TI  - First detection and molecular characterization of Dientamoeba fragilis in cattle.
LID - 10.1111/zph.12986 [doi]
AB  - Dientamoeba fragilis is a flagellated protozoan with amoeba-like morphology that inhabits the human gastrointestinal tract. It is endemic in a vast geographyaround the world, including developed countries. There are limited studies onnon-human hosts of the parasite, and suitable hosts have not been clarified. The parasite has been detected in non-human primates, pigs, cats, dogs and rats.There is no study in the literature investigating and detecting the presence ofthis parasite in cattle. In this study, stool samples taken from 163 differentcattle and calves from 11 different farms between March 2017 and May 2022 wereexamined for the detection of D. fragilis via PCR. Trichrome staining wasperformed on all PCR-positive samples. The isolates with the expected ampliconsize were sequenced using the 18S ribosomal RNA region, and their genotypes were determined by BLAST analysis. Sequences were analysed with the most similar andreference sequences in the literature, forming a phylogenetic tree. We detectedD. fragilis in 31 (19.01%) of the 163 stool samples. D. fragiliscysts/trophozoites were detected by trichrome staining method in six of 31samples. All PCR products selected for molecular analysis from positive sampleshad the same nucleotide sequence. As a result of BLAST analysis, all sequenceswere determined to belong to D. fragilis genotype 1. This study determined forthe first time that cattle are suitable hosts for D. fragilis. Furthermore, theparasite subtype we detected belongs to genotype 1, which is the most common typein humans, suggesting that the parasite may have a zoonotic character. Our resultis important in terms of the epidemiology of the parasite, as the mode oftransmission is controversial, and available data on its suitable hosts arelimited.

TI  - Validation of 3-dimensional mathematical computation of feline bladder volumeusing orthogonal ultrasonographic bladder images.
PG  - 209-217
AB  - Urine output measurement is critical for the management of hospitalized cats and their underlying conditions. Ultrasound-guided estimation of urinary bladdervolume (UBV) is a non-invasive surrogate measurement that can provide importantclinical information. The purpose of this study was to validate the accuracy of anovel 3D computation method in estimating UBV using 2D point-of-careultrasonographic images. Bladder volume estimation was performed usingcoordinates from bladder circumference tracings on paired longitudinal andtransverse ultrasonographic images (n = 359) aligned in 3D space for mathematicalalgorithmic computation. Ultrasonographic images were obtained by 2 differentobservers at 18 different time points on 10 healthy, purpose-bred male cats undergeneral anesthesia in sternal recumbency. Actual urine volumes were measured via urinary catheterization and compared to UBV estimations using Lin's concordancecorrelation coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis. Estimation of UBV using the 3Dcomputational bladder circumference tracing method showed moderatestrength-of-agreement with actual bladder volume (rhoc = 0.94 to 0.95) withclinically insignificant bias (3D computation-derived minus actual volume) of-1.96 mL (IQR = -3.89 to -0.57 mL, P < 0.001) and -2.42 mL (IQR = -4.64 to -0.66 mL, P < 0.001) for the 2 observers, respectively. Our study demonstratedacceptable accuracy of 3D computation method for UBV estimation in healthy cats. This method may provide a bridging alternative until 3D ultrasound becomes morereadily accessible.

TI  - Prevalence of protective feline panleukopenia antibody titers detected by apoint-of-care enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in cats presenting to auniversity emergency service.
PG  - 229-232
AB  - The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of protective antibodytiters against feline panleukopenia (FPL) in cats presenting to an emergencyservice. Seventy-five cats presenting for care for any injury or illness wereeligible for inclusion. Using American Association of Feline Practitionersguidelines, vaccine status - up-to-date, not up-to-date, or unconfirmed - wasrecorded. Titers against FPL were semi-quantified using a point-of-care test and were classified as protective or non-protective. Of the 75 cats enrolled, 49 had protective titers (65%), whereas 26 (35%) did not. Fifty cats (66.7%) wereconsidered up-to-date, whereas 25 cats (33.3%) were not up-to-date orunconfirmed. Not all up-to-date cats had positive titers and some cats withlapsed vaccines were still considered protected. Of the up-to-date cats, 35/50(70%) had protective titers, whereas 15 (30%) did not. Of the 25 cats that werenot up-to-date, titers were considered protective in 14 (56%) and absent in 11(44%). This study supports that even in cats considered up-to-date, it ispossible that adequate protection against FPL is not present. Care should betaken to appropriately isolate cats affected with illness attributable to FPLfrom other cats and prevent inadvertent nosocomial transmission.

TI  - Changes in glucose tolerance and insulin secretion in a cohort of cats withchronic obesity.
PG  - 181-187
AB  - Obesity, which is the most common spontaneous nutritional disorder in cats, is a known risk factor for the development of diabetes mellitus and has been linked toinsulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and altered adipose-derived hormonesecretion in cats. The objective of this study was to monitor and report changes in the results of serial intravenous glucose tolerance testing (IVGTT) and other metabolic parameters in 4 obese cats over a 4-year period. Serial IVGTT, insulin sensitivity indices, adipokine concentrations, and lipid profiles were evaluated.All cats had IVGTT changes consistent with impaired glucose tolerance and alteredinsulin secretory patterns during the 4-year study period. There was nosignificant increase in the fasting blood glucose or insulin concentrations andno changes in the insulin sensitivity indices evaluated. The mean adiponectinconcentration decreased significantly over time, but there was no significantincrease in the leptin concentration and no changes were observed in lipidprofiles. Although IVGTT can be used to document early and/or mild impairment of glucose tolerance and changes in insulin secretory pattern, this test cannot beeasily or readily carried out on client-owned cats in most clinical settings.More work needs to be done to establish reliable, convenient methods for earlier identification of cats at risk of developing clinical diabetes mellitus.

TI  - Comparison of home blood pressure and office blood pressure measurement in dogsand cats.
PG  - 203-208
AB  - The objectives of this study were to retrospectively compare blood pressuremeasurements obtained in clinic with those obtained at home from cats and dogsseen at our hospital and to investigate the potential for white-coat effect (WCE)and white-coat hypertension (WCH) in this population of 10 cats and 7 dogs.Medical records from Western College of Veterinary Medicine were searched toidentify patients with paired home and in-clinic blood pressure measurementstaken within 14 d. The results were compared with matched-pair analysis todetermine the agreement and bias. Significantly higher systolic and diastolicblood pressures were measured in the clinic compared with those from homemeasurements. A mean difference of +27.7 mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI): 17.1to 38.3 mmHg, P < 0.001] and +12.9 mmHg (95% CI: 6.4 to 19.5 mmHg, P = 0.0007)was found for systolic and diastolic pressure, respectively. The prevalence ofWCH in this population was 41%. A total of 39% of home blood pressuremeasurements by owners were free of artefacts as evaluated by waveforms onhigh-definition oscillometry (HDO) devices. The results of this study showed thatblood pressure measurements taken at home and at a clinic varied significantly,which was attributed to a high prevalence of white-coat effect and white-coathypertension in this clinical population.

AB  - The objective of the study was to analyse the prevalence of infection by N.caninum and T. gondii in breeding ewes from central western Mexico. For thispurpose, 184 blood samples were collected from sheep in the reproductive stage,which were analysed by ELISA and PCR tests, respectively, and the associationbetween seroprevalence and some management factors was estimated by means of alogistic regression analysis. For N. caninum, a seroprevalence of 15.22% wasidentified, while the DNA detection in blood was 14.13% (26/184); positiveanimals were found in 75% of the farms (6/8). The variables poor placental waste management (OR 8.4), abortion history (OR 1.5) and presence of rodents (OR 1.3)were identified as risk factors for N. caninum infection. In the case of T.gondii, a seroprevalence of 61.96% was found, and antibodies were detected ineight farms included in the study; no positive samples were identified for T.gondii by the PCR test. The main identified risk factors for T. gondii were asfollows: poor hygiene conditions (OR 12.5), presence of cats (OR 9.5), presenceof other domestic animals (OR 5.7), urban context of the farm (OR 9.5) and publicwater supply (OR 5.3). The seroprevalence of co-infection of T. gondii and N.caninum in breeding ewes was 7% (13/184; 95% CI 6.92-7.20). T. gondii has a high seroprevalence while N. caninum was of lower proportion, and both may beassociated with reproductive losses for these herds studied.

PG  - 11418
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-14993-2 [doi]
AB  - Thoracic radiograph (TR) is a complementary exam widely used in small animalmedicine which requires a sharp analysis to take full advantage of RadiographicPulmonary Pattern (RPP). Although promising advances have been made in deeplearning for veterinary imaging, the development of a Convolutional NeuralNetworks (CNN) to detect specifically RPP from feline TR images has not beeninvestigated. Here, a CNN based on ResNet50V2 and pre-trained on ImageNet isfirst fine-tuned on human Chest X-rays and then fine-tuned again on 500 annotatedTR images from the veterinary campus of VetAgro Sup (Lyon, France). The impact ofmanual segmentation of TR's intrathoracic area and enhancing contrast method onthe CNN's performances has been compared. To improve classification performances,200 networks were trained on random shuffles of training set and validation set. A voting approach over these 200 networks trained on segmented TR images producedthe best classification performances and achieved mean Accuracy, F1-Score,Specificity, Positive Predictive Value and Sensitivity of 82%, 85%, 75%, 81% and 88% respectively on the test set. Finally, the classification schemes werediscussed in the light of an ensemble method of class activation maps andconfirmed that the proposed approach is helpful for veterinarians.

LID - 10.5326/JAAHA-MS-7228 [doi]
AB  - A 7 yr old female neutered domestic shorthair was presented with a 2 mo historyof lethargy and hyporexia progressing to anorexia. Initial diagnostics indicated pancreatitis with secondary hepatic lipidosis. Supportive care, including theplacement of an esophageal feeding tube, was initiated. The feeding tube wasremoved traumatically by the cat and thus replaced. The cat acutely deteriorated while hospitalized, developing marked hypersalivation and an obtunded mentation. Radiographs were taken to confirm placement of the feeding tube in case tubedislodgement was contributing to the hypersalivation; results confirmedappropriate positioning and gastric pneumatosis. Despite intensified medicalmanagement, the patient suffered cardiopulmonary arrest 7 days after hospitaladmission. Post-mortem examination confirmed necrotizing gastritis with emphysemaalongside segmental mucosal necrosis in the jejunum, focal pancreatic necrosis,and diffuse hepatic lipidosis. Gas in the gastric wall is a rare finding inveterinary medicine and can arise due to gastric pneumatosis or emphysematousgastritis; there are scant reports of either in feline medicine. This reportdocuments a case of emphysematous gastritis in a cat with concurrent pancreatitisand hepatic lipidosis. The cat developed emphysematous gastritis withoutundergoing gastrointestinal surgery which is currently the only reported felinepredis-posing factor for development.

AB  - We evaluated the epidemiological, hematological, and pathological data ofLeishmania spp., Toxoplasma gondii, Platynosomum illiciens, felineimmunodeficiency virus (FIV), and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infections and thecoinfections in stray cats of an endemic area for leishmaniasis. The diagnosiswas performed by serological tests and necropsy. We described gross lesions andhistopathological findings. We used immunohistochemistry and chromogenic in situ hybridization for L. infantum detection. We found infection in 27 out of 50sampled cats, among them, 14 presented coinfections. A strong correlation betweensplenomegaly and lymphadenomegaly with FeLV, and an association between hepaticlesions and cachexia with parasitism due to P. illiciens were observed. Moreover,we found a significant increase in the monocyte count in the FeLV-infected and a decrease in the red blood cell count in the FIV-infected animals. Amastigoteforms of Leishmania spp. and tissue changes were detected in lymphoid organs ofan animal coinfected with P. illiciens, T. gondii, and FIV. Polyparasitismrecorded in stray cats of the Brazilian Midwest should be considered in effectivecontrol strategies for public health diseases. Moreover, stray cats of CampoGrande may be a source of infection of FIV, FeLV and P. illiciens for populationsof domiciled cats.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchiolar disorders are rarely recognized in cats. Constrictivebronchiolitis obliterans is characterized by concentric peribronchiolar fibrosis and inflammation of the bronchioles, but the underlying causes remain poorlyunderstood in current small animal medicine. CASE PRESENTATION: A 9-year-old cat presented with paroxysmal tachypnea, infrequent cough and persistent laborbreathing. Thoracic radiography showed lung hyperinflation andbronchointerstitial pattern, and pulmonary function assessment revealed flowlimitation in the late-expiratory phase and poor response to short-actingbronchodilator. Dorsally distributed subpleural ground glass opacities withdistinct margin and tree-in-bud opacities were observed on lung high-resolutioncomputed tomography. The cat underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and showedsevere neutrophilic inflammation. Feline herpesvirus was the only pathogendetected in the BAL fluid. Multiple therapeutic attempts were unsuccessful andthe cat died 8 weeks after the initial presentation. Necropsy revealed theinfiltration of inflammatory cells, obstruction of the bronchiolar lumen, andsubmucosal concentric fibrosis suggesting constrictive bronchiolitis obliterans. Combining the pre- and post-mortem findings, as well as the time from symptomonset or BAL to necropsy, constrictive bronchiolitis obliterans was possiblytriggered by a preceding feline herpesvirus infection in this case. CONCLUSIONS: The history of nonvaccinated status, lower airway neutrophilic inflammation, and presence of feline herpesvirus in the BAL fluid without coexistence of otherpathogens led to the presumption that constrictive bronchiolitis obliterans wasinduced by a preceding feline herpesvirus infection in this cat. The pathologicalchanges of bronchiolitis obliterans induced by a preceding feline herpesvirusinfection could be different from that of cats with acute herpesvirus pneumonia, such as intranuclear inclusions would disappear over time and were no longerfound 7-10 days after inoculation. The presence of patchy distribution ofsubpleural ground glass opacities on lung high-resolution computed tomographyshould raise the suspicion of peribronchiolar fibrosis. Clinical awareness ofbronchiolar disorders as a differential diagnosis is important in cats with lung hyperinflation and labored breathing who show poor reversibility tobronchodilator.

AB  - Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection affects cats worldwide. The course of FeLVinfection can change and vary over time. The complex pathogenesis, theavailability of many different testing methods, and the interpretation of testresults are often challenging for veterinarians. Cats with progressive infection (persistently p27 antigen-positive) shed FeLV mainly through saliva and aretherefore considered a source of infection for uninfected cats. Diagnosingregressive infection is often challenging, since it usually cannot be detected bycommonly used point of care-tests (p27 antigen test) and thus, it often remainsundetected. Nevertheless, cats with regressive infection are FeLV carriers(provirus-positive) and when the immune system is suppressed, reactivation of theinfection and FeLV-associated clinical signs can occur. Abortively infected cats are never viraemic, do not shed virus, and do not develop clinical signs.Abortive infection can solely be diagnosed via antibodies detection in blood. Anew point-of-care test for the identification of antibodies against FeLV p15Eantigen has recently been introduced on the European market and is currentlybeing evaluated.

LID - 10.1111/jvp.13044 [doi]
AB  - A novel transdermal buprenorphine solution (TBS) was developed for evaluation in order to make available an extended duration opioid analgesic for cats. Healthyadult cats were administered a single TBS dose of 10 mg (1.57-4.35 mg/kg), 30 mg (4.72-13.0 mg/kg), or 50 mg (7.87-21.7 mg/kg) (4 cats per group) appliedtopically to the unclipped dorsal cervical skin and plasma buprenorphineconcentrations were evaluated through 7 days. To determine the absolutebioavailability of TBS, healthy cats were administered single TBS dose of 20 mg(3.33-4.76 mg/kg) or 0.05 mg (0.008-0.011 mg/kg) IV buprenorphine (6 cats pergroup). The mean +/- standard deviation maximum plasma buprenorphineconcentrations (Cmax ) were 10.5 +/- 6.28, 18.6 +/- 8.68, and 22.5 +/- 4.47 ng/mlfollowing 10, 30, and 50 mg doses, respectively, with the time of Cmax occurrence(tmax ) typically occurring at 2-12 h post-dosing. Mean plasma buprenorphineterminal half-lives ranged between 78.3 and 91.2 h. Increasing the dose threefoldand fivefold from the 10 mg dose increased the exposure by 2.8- and 3.6-fold,respectively, indicating that plasma buprenorphine exposure increased in a lessthan proportional manner at doses >30 mg. Transient sedation, mydriasis, andeuphoria were observed within 4 h post-dosing. Mean rectal temperatures wereincreased 0.6-0.9 degrees C greater than baseline (37.4-37.8 degrees C) through168 h post-dosing. The absolute bioavailability was 16.0% (90% CI:[11.8%-21.7%]). Flip-flop pharmacokinetics were observed with a terminalelimination half-life of 0.82 +/- 0.13 and 64.9 +/- 15.0 h for IV buprenorphineand 20 mg of TBS, respectively. A single administration of TBS over a range ofdoses resulted in extended plasma buprenorphine concentrations and opioidphysiological and behavioral effects.

TI  - The history and pharmacology of buprenorphine: New advances in cats.
PG  - S1-S30
LID - 10.1111/jvp.13073 [doi]
AB  - Opiates have a long history of medical use as effective analgesics associatedwith well-described side effects, including euphoria, respiratory depression,constipation, bradycardia, and histamine release, among others. The search foropiate analogs that retain effective analgesic qualities without detrimental sideeffects has yielded numerous compounds, including buprenorphine. Early studies ofbuprenorphine demonstrated analgesic effectiveness with a favorable safetyprofile, leading to the approval of formulations for use in humans. Since then,advances in receptor theory and molecular cloning of opioid receptors have led toa deeper understanding of buprenorphine pharmacology. More recent studies ofreceptor affinity and intrinsic activity have shown that buprenorphine is a mu-and kappa-opioid receptor agonist, a nociceptin orphanin peptide agonist, and adelta-opioid receptor antagonist. Buprenorphine appears to have a primary spinal analgesic mechanism with complex supraspinal actions. It is considered a fullagonist for pain but a partial agonist for other clinical endpoints such asrespiratory depression. In feline medicine, buprenorphine is approved as low- andhigh-concentration injectable solutions, in addition to the most recentlyintroduced long-acting transdermal formulation. Several investigational andcompounded formulations have also been evaluated. There are contrastingdifferentiable features that include pharmacokinetics, onsets- anddurations-of-action, routes of administration, and formulation constituents.Available buprenorphine formulations allow clinicians to select a formulationbased on the anticipated duration of pain associated with various surgicalprocedures, and to provide interventions as needed. In light of the newlyapproved transdermal buprenorphine solution in cats and progress in buprenorphinepharmacology, the objective of this review is to examine the history andpharmacology of buprenorphine relative to full opioid agonists, whereappropriate, integrating these insights into advances within feline medicine.

LID - 10.1111/jvp.13051 [doi]
AB  - Transdermal buprenorphine solution (TBS) is approved for the control ofpostoperative pain in cats where a single preoperative dose provides 4 days ofanalgesia. It is administered as a unit dose of 8 mg to cats weighing 1.2-3 kgand 20 mg to cats weighing to >3-7.5 kg, which is equivalent to a dosage on abodyweight basis of 2.7-6.7 mg/kg. In this safety study, the 1X dose was defined as 6.7 mg/kg. Thirty-two cats (16 males and 16 females) were randomly allocatedto placebo, 1, 2, and 3X TBS administered topically to the dorsal cervical skinevery 4 days for 3 doses. Clinical observations, behavioral scores, mydriasisscore (yes/no), and physiological variables were assessed or measured prior toeach dose administration (0 h) and at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 hfollowing each treatment and prior to euthanasia on Day 12 or 13. Blood samplesfor clinical pathology were collected on Days - 1, 4, 8, and prior to euthanasia.There was little evidence of respiratory, cardiovascular, or gastrointestinaleffects. Respiratory rates were above the reference range in all groups and lowerby 10 breaths/min in the 3X group during the third dosing interval compared toplacebo. There were no differences in heart rates. Constipation was transientlyobserved in approximately equal numbers in placebo- and TBS-treated cats.Behavioral scores showed sedation or euphoria was transient in the first dosinginterval but became more prolonged with each dosing interval. Mydriasis wasprolonged in the first dosing interval and diminished by the third dosinginterval consistent with accommodation. Mean body temperatures in TBS-treatedcats were up to 0.6 degrees C (1.8 degrees F) greater than placebo-treated cats. There were no clinically relevant changes to serum chemistry, hematology, orurinalysis outcomes nor gross or microscopic observations attributable to TBS.These data demonstrate that TBS is safe and well-tolerated when administered to16-week-old cats at multiples of the approved dose and duration and supportsclinical safety in the event of delayed buprenorphine metabolism, medicationerrors, or alterations in the dosing regimen.

LID - 10.1111/jvp.13060 [doi]
AB  - A prospective, double masked, placebo-controlled, multicentered phase 3 clinical study was conducted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of transdermalbuprenorphine solution (TBS) for the control of post-operative pain in cats. Atotal of 228 cats from 12 US investigational sites met the enrollment criteria ofwhich 107 placebo- and 112 TBS-treated cats were included into the per protocolefficacy analysis. The dose of TBS was 8 mg (0.4 ml) to cats 1.2 to 3 kilogramsand 20 mg (1 ml) to cats >3 to 7.5 kilograms applied topically to the dorsalunclipped cervical skin 1-2 h prior to the undergoing elective surgicalreproductive sterilization in conjunction with forelimb onychectomy. Interactive pain assessments and physiological variables were quantified through 96 hfollowing recovery from anesthesia, and rescue analgesia was administered anytime that pain control was scored inadequate. Cats requiring rescue analgesia or experiencing an adverse event suspected to be treatment related were consideredtreatment failures. Sixty-five and 23 cats were considered treatment failures in the placebo and TBS groups, respectively, with most occurring on the day ofsurgery. The treatment success rates were 0.40 (95% confidence interval [CI]:[0.28-0.53]) and 0.81 (95% CI: [0.70-0.89]) in the placebo and TBS groups,respectively, and the difference was significant (p < .05). Adverse eventsoccurred at a similar frequency and were not clinically meaningful in eithertreatment group. The post-operative body temperatures over the duration of thestudy were on average 0.35 (95% CI: [0.20-0.50]) degrees C higher than baselinein TBS-treated cats and were not clinically meaningful, an observation typical ofopioids in cats. These results serve as substantial evidence that TBS is safe andeffective for the control of orthopedic and soft tissue post-operative pain incats when a single topical dose is applied 1-2 h prior to surgery.

AB  - A prospective, double-masked, placebo-controlled, multicentered phase 2 clinical study was conducted to select the transdermal buprenorphine solution (TBS) dosagefor the control of postoperative pain in cats. One-hundred fifteen (115) catswere randomized to a single topical dose of placebo solution, low-TBS dosage(1.91-2.07 mg/kg) or high-TBS dosage (4.27-4.88 mg/kg) prior to surgicalreproductive sterilization in conjunction with forelimb onychectomy. The low- andhigh-TBS doses were applied 2-4 and 1-2 hours prior to surgery. Interactive pain assessments and physiological variables were quantified through 96 hourspost-anesthetic recovery and rescue analgesia was administered any time thatanalgesia was considered inadequate. Cats requiring rescue analgesia wereconsidered treatment failures. The estimated overall treatment success rates fromgeneralized linear mixed effects model analysis were 0.10 (95% CI: [0.02-0.36]), 0.56 (95% CI: [0.25-0.83]), 0.71 (95% CI: [0.38-0.91]) in the placebo-, low-, andhigh-TBS dose groups, respectively. Success rates for both TBS treatment groupswere superior to placebo. Adverse events were infrequent in all treatment groups although the postoperative body temperatures over the duration of the study were on average 0.31 (95% CI: [0.08-0.55]) and 0.30 (95% CI: [0.05-0.53]) degrees Chigher in low- and high-TBS dose cats, respectively, compared to placebo. It isconcluded that both the low- and high-TBS dosages were safe and effective. Thehigh-TBS dosage resulted in a greater proportion of treatment successes over 96h, had a more acceptable preoperative application time of 1-2 h prior to surgery,and was therefore selected for further study.

LID - 10.1111/avj.13194 [doi]
AB  - Acute adverse reactions in cats administered unrefined canine paralysis tick(Ixodes holocyclus) antiserum are commonly observed by veterinarians and can leadto significant morbidity and potentially fatal. A purified antiserum canine IgGconcentrate was chromatographically prepared and aseptically formulated in singledoses containing the equivalent of 5 mL of unrefined tick antiserum (TAS). TheIgG was used for slow intravenous infusion into clinically affected cats atmultiple veterinary clinics on the eastern seaboard of Australia. Overall, 72/76 (95%) of cats survived hospital discharge, an efficacy comparable to publisheddata. A subset of 22 cats previously treated with unrefined TAS and consideredhigh risk were included in the dataset. The safety profile was excellent with0/76 acute adverse reactions although 2/76 (2.6%) developed mild facial swelling within 2 h of infusion that responded to the antihistamine. In conclusion, catsintravenously infused with purified IgG from canine TAS did not exhibit theexpected frequency of acute adverse reactions during infusion and it was bothsafe and effective for the treatment of tick paralysis in cats.

AB  - Spay/neuter identification tattoos and ear-tipping are simple and cost-effective methods to minimize the likelihood of unnecessary anesthesia and surgery incompanion animals or the misidentification of sexually intact animals. This studyassessed training of sterilization identifiers in US and Canadian veterinaryschools and practitioner compliance with guidelines for identifiers via surveysconducted in 2019. Faculty in all 34 schools responded to the survey, reportingthat curricula included sterilization identifiers in 31% of lecture-basedtraining, 75% of spay/neuter laboratory-based training, and 38% of clinicalpractice-based training. A total of 425 facilities performing spay/neuterreported frequency and technical aspects of sterilization identifiers inclient-owned and unowned (shelter, rescue, trap-neuter-return) animals.Facilities encountering large numbers of animals of unknown background,performing a high number of surgeries, or with specialized spay/neuter trainingwere significantly more likely to use identifiers. Only 5% of private practicestattooed all owned animals, and 21% tattooed all unowned animals. In contrast,80% of shelters and 72% of spay/neuter clinics tattooed all owned animals, and84% of shelters and 70% of spay/neuter clinics tattooed all unowned animals.Green was the most common tattoo color (97%); the most common placement was near or in the incision for female cats (99%), female dogs (99%), and male dogs (92%),and ventral abdomen in male cats (55%). Enhanced training and implementation ofbest practices described in professional guidelines for sterilization identifiersare needed throughout the veterinary industry to protect animals from unnecessaryprocedures and to prevent unintended litters in animals misidentified aspreviously sterilized.

TI  - Dissection Techniques and Histological Sampling of the Heart in Large AnimalModels for Cardiovascular Diseases.
LID - 10.3791/63809 [doi]
AB  - The standard gross examination and sampling are key elements in thereproducibility and success of experimental studies of cardiovascular diseasescarried out in large animals. Considering the complex anatomy of the heart,interspecies differences, and the types of compensatory and pathologicalreactions, consistent protocols are challenging to implement. The utilization of multiple dissection protocols is usually adapted to suit the prosector'sexperience, and personal preference continues to be a source of experimental and interobserver variability. Here, the aim is to present the main anatomicalfeatures and landmarks, dissection protocols, and histological sampling standardsof the heart in some commonly used species (including dogs, pigs, ruminants, and cats) as models of cardiovascular diseases. Two standard gross examinationprotocols are presented here. First, the inflow-outflow method, which follows thephysiological blood flow direction through the heart and large vessels(frequently used in dogs, ruminants, and pigs), and second, the four-chamberdissection technique (exemplified in cats). Both techniques can be adapted to anyspecies in certain experimental circumstances. The sampling protocols include allthe areas of interest (sinoatrial node, ventricles, interventricular septum,atria, valves, and aorta), and if properly carried out, improve both thereproducibility and reliability of experimental studies.

TI  - Complete vaginectomy via a ventral approach with pelvic osteotomy in a cat.
PG  - 695-700
AB  - A 6-year-old, intact female, domestic short-hair cat had a 3-month history ofobstipation. On physical examination and diagnostic imaging, megacolon secondary to a large, intrapelvic vaginal mass was diagnosed. An ovariohysterectomy and acomplete vaginectomy via a ventral midline celiotomy and bilateral pubic andischial osteotomies were performed. This approach allowed excellent exposure ofthe entire genital tract necessary to excise the large vaginal mass. The mass washistologically diagnosed as a vaginal fibrous stromal polyp. Obstipation resolved12 h after surgery. On radiographic recheck 11 d after surgery, the colon hadreturned to normal size. No major surgical complications were observed. This isthe first case report of a complete vaginectomy via the ventral approach with apelvic osteotomy in a cat. Furthermore, this report describes the differentsurgical techniques used in animals affected by a large vaginal mass and providesevidence that an aggressive surgical approach and en-bloc excision can beconsidered for the management of extensive intrapelvic vaginal masses in cats.

AB  - Arterial thromboembolism is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates incats. Definitive diagnosis requires advanced imaging modalities, such as computedtomography angiography (CTA) and contrast-enhanced (CE) magnetic resonanceangiography (MRA). However, CTA involves exposure to a large amount of ionizedradiation, and CE-MRA can cause systemic nephrogenic fibrosis.Non-contrast-enhanced (NE) MRA can help accurately diagnose vascular lesionswithout such limitations. In this study, we evaluated the ability of NE-MRA usingthree-dimensional electrocardiograph-gated fast spin-echo (3D ECG-FSE) and 3Dtime-of-flight (3D TOF) imaging to visualize the aorta and external iliacarteries in clinically healthy cats and compared the results with those obtained using CE-MRA. All 11 cats underwent 3D ECG-FSE, 3D TOF, and CE-MRA sequences.Relative signal intensity (rSI) for quantitative image analysis and image qualityscores (IQS) for qualitative image analysis were assessed; the rSI values basedon the 3D TOF evaluations were significantly lower than those obtained using 3DECG-FSE (aorta 3D TOF: 0.57 +/- 0.06, aorta 3D ECG-FSE: 0.83 +/- 0.06, P < 0.001;external iliac arteries 3D TOF: 0.45 +/- 0.06, external iliac arteries 3DECG-FSE:0.80 +/- 0.05, P < 0.001) and similar to those obtained using CE-MRA(aorta: 0.58 +/- 0.05, external iliac arteries: 0.57 +/- 0.03). Moreover, IQSobtained using 3D TOF were significantly higher than those obtained using 3DECG-FSE (aorta 3D TOF: 3.95 +/- 0.15, aorta 3D ECG-FSE: 2.32 +/- 0.60, P < 0.001;external iliac arteries 3D ECG-FSE: 3.98 +/- 0.08, external iliac arteries 3DECG-FSE: 2.23 +/- 0.56, P < 0.001) and similar to those obtained using CE-MRA(aorta: 3.61 +/- 0.41, external iliac arteries: 3.57 +/- 0.41). Thus, 3D TOF ismore suitable and produces consistent image quality for visualizing the aorta andexternal iliac arteries in clinically healthy cats and this will be of great helpin the diagnosis of FATE.

AB  - The current feline genotyping array of 63 k single nucleotide polymorphisms hasproven its utility for mapping within breeds, and its use has led to theidentification of variants associated with Mendelian traits in purebred cats.However, compared to single gene disorders, association studies of complexdiseases, especially with the inclusion of random bred cats with relatively lowlinkage disequilibrium, require a denser genotyping array and an increased samplesize to provide statistically significant associations. Here, we undertook amulti-breed study of 1,122 cats, most of which were admitted and phenotyped fornine common complex feline diseases at the Cornell University Hospital forAnimals. Using a proprietary 340 k single nucleotide polymorphism mapping array, we identified significant genome-wide associations with hyperthyroidism, diabetesmellitus, and eosinophilic keratoconjunctivitis. These results provide genomiclocations for variant discovery and candidate gene screening for these important complex feline diseases, which are relevant not only to feline health, but alsoto the development of disease models for comparative studies.

AB  - Colonic intramural hematoma is a rare condition in humans and companion animals. Its clinical presentation in cats has not previously been reported. An 8-year-oldmale American shorthair cat presented with acute onset of constipation andanorexia for 3 days. Laboratory examination indicated mild elevation of alanineaminotransferase, globulin, and total protein levels. Complete blood count wasnormal. Radiographs revealed a soft tissue opacity mass located caudodorsally to the urinary bladder, causing narrowing of the descending colonic lumen.Sonography showed a heteroechogenic intraluminal mass containing liquefiedcontent between the submucosal and muscular layers of the descending colon. Oncomputed tomographic images, the mass contained two different attenuated contentswith an interface. Colonoscopy was then performed for intestinal biopsy, and the contents observed in the intraluminal mass were drained via surgical evacuationand considered as blood clots. Supportive medical treatment, includingantibiotics and fecal softener, was administered, and the clinical signs resolveduneventfully. Mild chronic proctitis without apparent malignancy was confirmedhistopathologically, and no recurrence was observed after more than 14 months,and thus a colonic intramural hematoma was presumptively diagnosed. Theinformation provided by multimodal imaging of the mass was essential for thediagnosis and determination of the treatment in this case.

TI  - Chasing perception in domestic cats and dogs.
LID - 10.1007/s10071-022-01643-3 [doi]
AB  - Chasing motion is often used to study the perception of inanimate objects asanimate. When chasing interaction and independent motions between two agents are displayed simultaneously on a screen, we expect observers to quickly perceive andrecognise the chasing pattern (because of its familiarity) and turn theirattention to the independent motion (novelty effect). In case of isoscelestriangles as moving figures, dogs and humans both display this behaviour, butdogs initially preferred to look at the chasing pattern whereas humans started toincrease their gaze towards the independent motion earlier. Here, we comparedwhether family cats perceive moving inanimate objects as animate and whethertheir looking behaviour is similar to that of small family dogs. We displayed achasing and independent motion side by side on a screen in two consecutive trialsand assessed subjects' looking behaviour towards the motions. Similarly toprevious studies, we found that dogs eventually looked longer at the independent motion, but cats preferred to look at the independent motion at the beginning of the video display and only later shifted their attention to the chasing motion.No difference was found in the frequency of gaze alternation of the two species. Thus, although cats discriminate between the chasing and independent motions, it is not clear whether this discrimination is controlled by animate motion cues.The difference may originate from their ecological situation and/or may beexplained by specific perceptual mechanisms.

TI  - Feline obesity causes hematological and biochemical changes and oxidative stress - a pilot study.
LID - 10.1007/s11259-022-09940-5 [doi]
AB  - Obesity, an extremely important factor in feline clinical practice, is estimated to affect up to one third of the feline population. Moreover, it can triggerchronic inflammation, which could predispose to oxidative stress by increasingreactive oxygen species, thereby generating potentially irreversible cellulardamage. This study analyzed hematological, biochemical and oxidative stressprofiles at various degrees of feline obesity. Forty-five cats were selected and divided into three groups: control (n = 17), overweight (n = 13) and obese (n =15), after clinical and laboratory evaluation and body condition score.Biochemical and oxidative stress analyses were performed using a photocolorimeterand hematological analyses were performed in a veterinary cell counter. Obesecats showed increased mean corpuscular volume (MCV), red cell distribution width (RDW), HDL cholesterol and triglycerides and decreased activity of gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) than control cats, although within the reference ranges for thespecies. As for oxidative stress, obese cats showed higher total antioxidantcapacity (TAC), by the inhibition of2,2'-Azino-Bis-3-Ethylbenzthiazoline-6-Sulfonic Acid (ABTS), inhibition of ABTSassociated with horseradish peroxidase (ABTS + HRP), cupric ion reducingantioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP)methods, while overweight cats had a higher TAC-ABTS + HRP and TAC-FRAP thancontrol cats. We conclude that the conditions of natural obesity and overweightin the feline species alter its hematological, biochemical and oxidative stressparameters.

TI  - Anti-Sporothrix Antibody Detection in Domestic Cats as an Indicator of a PossibleNew Occurrence Area for Sporotrichosis in North Brazil.
PG  - 375-384
LID - 10.1007/s11046-022-00644-7 [doi]
AB  - Feline sporotrichosis has emerged as an important public health issue in somecountries, especially Brazil. Currently, zoonotic transmission of Sporothrixbrasiliensis by domestic cats is the major sporotrichosis spread form throughout this country. Sporotrichosis in Brazil is a good model for the One Health conceptapplication, which connects the environment, human and animal health. Under this thinking, the aim of this study was to investigate the seroprevalence ofsporotrichosis in cats from Rolim de Moura, Rondonia, Brazil, using antibodydetection by an ELISA test previously validated for human diagnosis. For thestandardization of this test, 30 serum samples from cats with provensporotrichosis and 11 sera from healthy cats were used. The assay showed 87%sensitivity and 100% specificity for the diagnosis of feline sporotrichosis.After the standardization, 202 serum samples from distinct cats from Rolim deMoura were evaluated. The test was positive in 63 (31.19%) cats from the studied area. A multivariate analysis revealed that living far from forest oragricultural areas as well as pure breed animals had higher odds ratios (3.157and 2.281, respectively) for the presence of detectable levels of anti-Sporothrixantibodies. These results show the applicability of this assay in the detectionof anti-Sporothrix antibodies in feline serum samples and point to a putative newoccurrence area of urban sporotrichosis dispersing to the North region of Brazil.

AB  - Feline calicivirus (FCV) is a common and important pathogen in cats, typicallyresulting in upper respiratory tract disease or ulcerative oral lesions. Althoughthere are large number of researches on FCV and vaccines against FCV have beenwidely used for years, the explanation for vaccination failure and furtherstudies on the prevalence of FCV are still necessary in China. In this study, 86 nasopharyngeal swabs from pet cats with upper respiratory symptoms from severalNanjing animal hospitals were collected in 2020. Among them, 36 (41.86%) werepositive for FCV. In addition, 13 FCV capsid genes were sequenced. Thecomparative analysis of linear B-cell epitopes of VP1 gene indicated that therewere many amino acid variations existed among FCV vaccine strains and thesestrains currently circulating in Nanjing, which may relate to the failure ofvaccination and maybe aid for future vaccine design. Besides, phylogeneticanalysis of capsid gene revealed two genotypes. Except for the F86 strain, mostof the strains were clustered with FCV I genotype, which indicated that FCV Igenotype was the most prevalent genotype currently circulating in Nanjing. Inconclusion, this study provided useful information as to the evolution andgenetic variants of FCV in Nanjing, which is urgent for the future instructionsof effective disease prevention and control strategies.

TI  - Anatomical study of arterial arrangement of the spinal cord in Syrian hamsters(Mesocricetus auratus).
LID - 10.1007/s12565-022-00678-3 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the arterial arrangement of the spinal cord inSyrian hamsters, and to identify differences and similarities to humans andexperimental animals that are mostly used as models in studies into ischemicspinal cord injuries. This observational anatomical study was conducted on 20adult Syrian hamsters using dissection and corrosion casting technique. Thegeneral anatomy of the arterial blood supply of spinal cord was obtained andnoted as follows: (1) high variability in the level of the origin of right andleft vertebral arteries, (2) the independent origin of dorsal intercostalarteries, (3) origin of lumbar arteries as a common trunk with right and leftdivisions, (4) presence of dorsal and ventral radicular branches in both sides ofthe cervical spinal cord with almost the same frequency, (5) greater presence of ventral and dorsal radicular branches in the left side of the thoracolumbarspinal cord, (6) two dorsal spinal arteries originating from the posteriorinferior cerebellar arteries and extending to the caudal end of the thoracicspinal cord, (7) continuous ventral spinal artery originating from both vertebralarteries and extending to the conus medularis, and (8) presence of the artery of Adamkiewicz in the thoracic region of the spinal cord. From comparative anatomyviewpoints, the arteries supplying the spinal cord of Syrian hamsters exhibitmany similarities with humans, laboratory rodents, and rabbits in many aspectscompared to dogs, cats, and pigs. Overall, Syrian hamsters can be used as aproposed model in experimental studies of the spinal cord ischemia.

TI  - Feline Diaphyseal Fractures: Management and treatment options.
PG  - 662-674
LID - 10.1177/1098612X221106354 [doi]
AB  - PRACTICAL RELEVANCE: Cats frequently present with diaphyseal fractures, whichrequire treatment in order to achieve a good return to function. These fractures often occur due to significant trauma; for example, as a result of road trafficaccidents, high-rise syndrome and dog bite wounds. The first priority is toensure the patient is systemically well before embarking on any specific surgicaltreatment of a fracture. CLINICAL CHALLENGES: Surgical management of diaphysealfractures can be challenging due to the surgical approach for some bones beingtechnically demanding, for example because of the presence of importantneurovascular structures, and the small size of feline bones, which limits thechoice of implant size and strength. Further, it may be difficult to visualisefracture alignment when using minimally invasive techniques, although the use of intraoperative fluoroscopy can aid with this, and malalignment can be common for some fracture repairs, particularly in cases where anatomical reconstruction isnot possible. AIMS: This review focuses on diaphyseal long bone fractures andaims to assist decision-making, with an overview of the management and treatment options available. EVIDENCE BASE: Many textbooks and original articles have been published on aspects of managing fractures in small animals. The authors alsoprovide recommendations based upon their own clinical experience.

AB  - PRACTICAL RELEVANCE: Inappetence may have many origins and, as a presenting sign or observation in the hospitalised patient, is common in feline practice.Nutritional assessment of every patient is encouraged, to identify the need for, and appropriate type of, intervention indicated. The impact of malnutrition maybe significant on the feline patient, perpetuating illness, delaying recovery,slowing wound healing and negatively impacting gut health and immunity. Delayedintervention may result in the cat's deterioration; hence prompt control ofcontributing factors such as the underlying illness, pain, nausea, ileus andstress is vital to optimise voluntary food intake. Management is multimodal,comprising reduction of stress, medications and assisted nutrition in the form oftube feeding or parenteral nutrition. Use of antiemetic, analgesic, prokineticand appetite stimulant medications may restore appetite, but placement of feedingtubes should not be delayed. Feeding tubes are generally well tolerated and allowprovision of food, water and medication with minimal stress, although clinicians must be aware of complications such as stoma site infections and refeedingsyndrome. CLINICAL CHALLENGES: Cats are vulnerable to malnutrition owing to theirunique metabolism and specific nutritional requirements. Moreover, their natureas a species means they are susceptible to stress in the hospital environment,which may result in reduced food intake; previous negative experiences maycompound the problem. In particular, an inappropriate clinic environment and/orhandling may cause or exacerbate inappetence in hospitalised patients, withnegative impacts on recovery. Postponing interventions such as feeding tubeplacement to await improvement, owing to clinician or caregiver apprehension, mayhinder recovery and worsen nutritional deficits. EVIDENCE BASE: The 2022 ISFMConsensus Guidelines on Management of the Inappetent Hospitalised Cat have beencreated by a panel of experts brought together by the International Society ofFeline Medicine (ISFM). Information is based on the available literature, expert opinion and the panel members' experience.

TI  - Feline Comorbidities: Clinical perspective on diabetes mellitus and pancreatitis.
PG  - 651-661
LID - 10.1177/1098612X221106355 [doi]
AB  - PRACTICAL RELEVANCE: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most common felineendocrine disorders. It has been shown by several studies that DM in catsfrequently coexists with pancreatitis. CLINICAL CHALLENGES: It has not beendefinitively established what the exact pathogenetic association between DM andpancreatitis is in the cat. However, the association between these two conditionsis most likely bidirectional, with DM predisposing cats to pancreatitis and vice versa. Diagnosis of pancreatitis in cats with DM is crucial because concurrentpancreatitis commonly leads to difficulties in the management of DM. Whenpancreatitis is associated with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), therapeuticmanagement is even more challenging. AIMS: This review focuses on the concurrent presence of DM or DKA and pancreatitis in cats, mainly focusing on their clinicalmanagement. EVIDENCE BASE: Information provided in this review is based onfeline-specific clinical research when available. In addition, comparative andhuman research, as well as clinical experience, has been used to enrich knowledgein areas where feline-specific research is not yet available.

LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.863990 [doi]
AB  - In this retrospective, exploratory study, intake and outcome data were compiledfrom 1,373 U.S. animal shelters for which such data were reported consistentlyacross a five-year study period (2016-2020). Linear regression analysis was used to examine the five-year trends and the impacts of the first year of the COVID-19pandemic (2020) on the overall trends in intake and outcomes in U.S. animalshelters. The results of the analysis reveal that total intake and euthanasia forboth dogs and cats significantly decreased over the study period. The adoption,return-to-owner, return-to-field, and transfer (for cats) categories as apercentage of intake all showed significant increases. Live release rates as afunction of total intakes and total outcomes for both dogs and cats showedsignificant increases over the study period. The findings from this study addressa critical gap in the field by summarizing emerging trends at the national level in how cats and dogs are being served in U.S. animal shelters.

PG  - 891603
LID - 10.3389/fpsyt.2022.891603 [doi]
AB  - Background: Psychiatric patients are at increased risk of exposure to Toxoplasma gondii infection, which may be linked to their living facilities and behaviors.Limited knowledge on the prevalence of T. gondii infection and its associatedrisk factors in psychiatric patients are available to the international medicalcommunities. Thus, the aim of the current study was to assess seroprevalence ofT. gondii and its associated risk factors in psychiatric inpatients in FarsProvince, southern Iran. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out onpsychiatric patients hospitalized in Ibn Sina Hospital affiliated to ShirazUniversity of Medical Sciences, Fars Province, southern Iran, March to July 2021.Blood samples were collected from 318 psychiatric patients and assessed for thedetection of IgG against T. gondii using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA). Moreover, structured questionnaires were completed for the participants at the time of sampling. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess possibleassociations between the latent toxoplasmosis and the variables. Results: Theoverall seroprevalence of anti-T. gondii IgG in psychiatric inpatients was 22.3% (71/318; 95% CI = 17.9-27.3). Multivariate analyses revealed that age > 30 years [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.24, 95% CI = 1.10-4.60, p = 0.03], contact withcats (AOR = 2.52, 95% CI = 1.14-5.58, p = 0.03), raw vegetable consumption (AOR =3.65, 95% CI = 1.74-7.65, p = 0.001), raw/undercooked meat consumption (AOR =4.30, 95% CI = 1.47-12.63, p = 0.008), suicide attempt (AOR = 3.77, 95% CI =1.58-8.97, p = 0.003) and cigarette smoking history (AOR = 0.38, 95% CI =0.17-0.83, p = 0.02) were independent risk factors for T. gondii infection.Conclusion: The current results demonstrated that contact with cats, rawvegetable consumption and raw/undercooked meat consumption were independent risk factors for T. gondii seropositivity. Moreover, the current study showedsignificant associations between seropositivity of T. gondii and suicide attemptsas well as negative associations between seropositivity of T. gondii andcigarette smoking in psychiatric inpatients using multivariate logisticregression.

TI  - De novo Mutations in Domestic Cat are Consistent with an Effect of ReproductiveLongevity on Both the Rate and Spectrum of Mutations.
LID - msac147 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/molbev/msac147 [doi]
AB  - The mutation rate is a fundamental evolutionary parameter with direct andappreciable effects on the health and function of individuals. Here, we examinethis important parameter in the domestic cat, a beloved companion animal as well as a valuable biomedical model. We estimate a mutation rate of 0.86 x 10-8 per bpper generation for the domestic cat (at an average parental age of 3.8 years). Wefind evidence for a significant paternal age effect, with more mutationstransmitted by older sires. Our analyses suggest that the cat and the human have accrued similar numbers of mutations in the germline before reaching sexualmaturity. The per-generation mutation rate in the cat is 28% lower than what has been observed in humans, but is consistent with the shorter generation time inthe cat. Using a model of reproductive longevity, which takes into accountdifferences in the reproductive age and time to sexual maturity, we are able toexplain much of the difference in per-generation rates between species. Wefurther apply our reproductive longevity model in a novel analysis of mutationspectra and find that the spectrum for the cat resembles the human mutationspectrum at a younger age of reproduction. Together, these results implicatechanges in life-history as a driver of mutation rate evolution between species.As the first direct observation of the paternal age effect outside of rodents andprimates, our results also suggest a phenomenon that may be universal amongmammals.

PG  - 3451-3464
LID - 10.2166/wst.2022.186 [doi]
AB  - A predictive model based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) for modelingprimary settling tanks' (PSTs) behavior in wastewater treatment plants wasdeveloped in this study. Two separate ANNs were built using input data, rawwastewater characteristics, and operating conditions. The output data from theANNs consisted of the total suspended solids (TSS) concentration and chemicaloxygen demand (COD) as predictions of PSTs' typical effluent parameters. Datafrom a large-scale wastewater treatment plant was used to illustrate theapplicability of the predictive model proposal. The ANNs model showed a highprediction accuracy during the training phase. Comparisons with availableempirical and statistical models suggested that the ANNs model provides accurate estimations. Also, the ANNs were tested using new experimental data to verifytheir reproducibility under actual operating conditions. The predicted valueswere calculated with satisfactory results, having an average absolute deviationof <20%. The model could be adapted to any large-scale wastewater plant tomonitor and control the operation of primary settling tanks, taking advantage of the ANNs' learning capacity.

AB  - Case summary: An 8.75-year-old male neutered Burmese cat was referred fortreatment of pyothorax. The cat was responsive, cardiovascularly stable andtachypnoeic (40 breaths/min) on arrival. Medical management of pyothorax wasinitiated, bilateral thoracic drains were placed and thoracic lavage usingaliquots of saline 0.9% was performed every 4 h. Regional analgesia was provided using 1 mg/kg of intrapleural bupivacaine divided equally between the left andright hemithoraxes every 6 h. On the second day of hospitalisation, the catdeveloped hypersalivation, mydriasis and tonic-clonic seizure activity 25 minsafter accidental intrapleural administration of a 10 mg/kg bupivacaine overdose. Cardiovascular compromise was also noted; the cat became bradycardic (120beats/min) and blood pressure decreased to 110 mmHg. Clinical signs resolvedafter administration of intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) as an intravenous (IV)bolus (1.5 ml/kg over 5 mins), followed by a continuous rate infusion (0.25ml/kg/min over 25 mins). Local anaesthetic intrapleural anaesthesia wasdiscontinued. There was recrudescence of clinical signs 10 h post-overdose andrepeat ILE 20% infusion was required. The cat was discharged with no ongoingcomplications. Relevance and novel information: Treatment of IV local anaestheticsystemic toxicity with ILE has been reported in cats. To our knowledge, this isthe first reported case of intrapleural bupivacaine overdose with initialresponse and resolution of clinical signs followed by recrudescence andsubsequent successful treatment using ILE.

TI  - The Emergence of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. apii Race 4 and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. coriandrii Highlights Major Obstacles Facing Agricultural Production inCoastal California in a Warming Climate: A Case Study.
PG  - 921516
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2022.921516 [doi]
AB  - Currently, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. apii (Foa) race 4 in celery and F. oxysporumf. sp. coriandrii (Foci) in coriander have the characteristics of emerginginfectious plant diseases in coastal southern California: the pathogens arespreading, yield losses can be severe, and there are currently no economicalsolutions for their control. Celery, and possibly coriander, production in these regions is are likely to have more severe disease from projected warmerconditions in the historically cool, coastal regions. Experimental evidence showsthat Foa race 4 causes much higher disease severity when temperatures exceed 21degrees C. A phylogenomic analysis indicated that Foa race 4, an older, lessvirulent, and uncommon Foa race 3, and two Foci are closely related in theirconserved genomes. These closely related genotypes are somatically compatible.Foa race 4 can also cause disease in coriander and the two organisms readily form"hetero" conidial anastomosis tubes (CAT), further increasing the likelihood ofparasexual recombination and the generation of novel pathotypes. A horizontalchromosome transfer event likely accounts for the difference in host rangebetween Foci versus Foa races 4 and 3 because they differ primarily in one or twoaccessory chromosomes. How Foa race 4 evolved its hyper-virulence is unknown.Although the accessory chromosomes of Foa races 3 and 4 are highly similar, thereis no evidence that Foa race 4 evolved directly from race 3, and races 3 and 4probably only have a common ancestor. Foa race 2, which is in a different cladewithin the Fusarium oxysporum species complex (FOSC) than the other Foa, did not contribute to the evolution of race 4, and does not form CATs with Foa race 4;consequently, while inter-isolate CAT formation is genetically less restrictivethan somatic compatibility, it might be more restricted between FOSC clades than currently known. Other relatively new F. oxysporum in coastal California include F. oxysporum f. sp. fragariae on strawberry (Fof). Curiously, Fof"yellows-fragariae" isolates also have similar core genomes to Foa races 4 and 3 and Foci, perhaps suggesting that there may be core genome factors in thislineage that favor establishment in these soils.

TI  - Feline Adipose Derived Multipotent Stromal Cell Transdifferentiation IntoFunctional Insulin Producing Cell Clusters.
PG  - 904519
LID - 10.3389/fbioe.2022.904519 [doi]
AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most prevalent feline endocrinopathies,affecting up to 1% of pet cats. De novo generation of functional insulinproducing cell (IPC) clusters via transdifferentiation of feline adipose-derived multipotent stromal cells (ASCs) may not only provide a viable, functional celltherapy for feline DM, but may also serve as a platform for developing acomparable human treatment given feline and human DM similarities. Cells wereinduced to form IPCs with a novel, three-stage culture process with stromal ordifferentiation medium under static and dynamic conditions. Clusters wereevaluated for intracellular zinc, viability, intracellular insulin, glucagon, andsomatostatin, ultrastructure, glucose stimulated insulin secretion in thepresence or absence of theophylline, and protein and gene expression. Isolatedcells were multipotent, and cell clusters cultured in both media had robust cell viability. Those cultured in differentiation medium contained zinc and mono- orpolyhormonal alpha-, beta-, and delta-like cells based on immunohistochemicallabeling and Mallory-Heidenhan Azan-Gomori's staining. Ultrastructurally, cellclusters cultured in differentiation medium contained insulin granules withinvesicles, and clusters had a concentration-dependent insulin response to glucose in the presence and absence of theophylline which increased both insulinsecretion and intracellular content. Expression of NK6.1, Pax6, Isl1, Glut2,RAB3A, glucagon, insulin, and somatostatin increased with differentiation stagefor both sexes, and expression of nestin at stages 1 and 2 and Neurod1 at stage 2was higher in cells from female donors. The cluster insulin secretion responsesand endocrine and oncogene gene expression profiles were inconsistent withinsulinoma characteristics. A total of 180 proteins were upregulated indifferentiated clusters, and the majority were associated with biologicalregulation, metabolic processes, or stimulus response. Dynamic culture of IPCclusters resulted in clusters composed of cells primarily expressing insulin thatreleased higher insulin with glucose stimulation than those in static culture.Collectively, the results of this study support generation of functional IPCclusters using feline ASCs isolated from tissues removed during routinesterilization. Further, cluster functionality is enhanced with dynamic,motion-driven shear stress. This work establishes a foundation for development ofstrategies for IPC therapy for short or long-term diabetes treatment and mayrepresent an option to study prevention and treatment of diabetes across species.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Leptospirosis is a neglected disease in Vietnam. Until now, therehas been limited knowledge about risk factors of this disease in Vietnam. Thestudy was carried out to identify agricultural and behavioral factors associated with the transmission of leptospirosis in Vietnam. METHODS: This matchedretrospective hospital-community-based case-control study was conducted from 1October 2018 to 31 October 2019. We recruited cases from 11 selected governmenthospitals in three provinces of Vietnam, while controls were selected from thesame communes of cases and matched by age (+/- 2 years) and sex. Microscopicagglutination test (MAT) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) wereapplied to determine confirmed cases, while only MAT was used to identifycontrols with a single high MAT titer < 1:100. RESULTS: 504 participants (252cases and 252 controls) were identified. Cultivating (OR 2.83, CI 1.38-5.79),animal farming (OR 8.26, CI 2.24-30.52), pig owners (OR 10.48, CI 5.05-21.73),cat owners (OR 2.62, CI 1.49-4.61) and drinking unboiled water (OR 1.72, CI 1.14 -2.59, p = 0.010) were significantly associated with human leptospirosis inVietnam. Hand washing after farming/ gardening (OR 0.57, CI 0.38-0.86, p = 0.007)and bathing after farming, gardening, contact with cattle and poultry (OR 0.33,CI 0.19-0.58, p = 0.000) were determined as protective factors for this disease. CONCLUSIONS: In short, the case-control study has revealed the risks inagricultural and animal practices and protective behavioral factors related tohuman leptospirosis in Vietnam. The findings suggested promotion of communicationand health education programs targeting health behaviors in daily life andagricultural practices. Using personal protective equipment such as gowns,gloves, and boots during agricultural practices, especially cultivating andanimal farming, is most recommended.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Toxoplasma gondii is a apicomplexan parasite of virtually allwarm-blooded species. All true cats (Felidae) can act as definitive hosts forthis parasite by shedding resistant oocysts into the environment. However, thepatterns of oocysts shedding are only partially understood in domestic cats andlargely unknown in wild felids. OBJECTIVES: We carried out molecular analysis of 82 faecal samples from wild felids collected in the Serra dos Orgaos NationalPark (Parnaso), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. METHODS: We screened samples for T.gondii DNA using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) targeting the529bp DNA fragment. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive samples weregenotyped using 15 microsatellite markers. RESULTS: Only one faecal sample from aPuma yagouaroundi was PCR-positive [cycle threshold (Ct) = 26.88]. This samplewas contaminated by a T. gondii strain of BrIII lineage, a common lineage indomestic animals from Brazil. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: This first report of T. gondii infaeces of wild South American felids in their natural environment indicatesinfrequent oocyst shedding and suggests a role of acquired immunity in limitingre-excretion as in domestic cats. The presence of a domestic strain of T. gondii in a faecal sample from a wild felid at very low concentrations (not detected by microscopy) is consistent with the hypothesis of host-parasite co-adaptationslimiting the circulation of T. gondii strains between domestic and wildenvironments.

TI  - The enteric virome of cats with feline panleukopenia differs in abundance anddiversity from healthy cats.
LID - 10.1111/tbed.14646 [doi]
AB  - Feline panleukopenia (FPL) is a severe, often fatal disease caused by felinepanleukopenia virus (FPV). How infection with FPV might impact the composition ofthe entire eukaryotic enteric virome in cats has not been characterized. We used meta-transcriptomic and viral particle enrichment metagenomic approaches tocharacterize the enteric viromes of 23 cats naturally infected with FPV(FPV-cases) and 36 age-matched healthy shelter cats (healthy controls).Sequencing reads from mammalian infecting viral families largely belonged to the Coronaviridae, Parvoviridae and Astroviridae. The most abundant viruses among thehealthy control cats were feline coronavirus, Mamastrovirus 2 and Carnivorebocaparvovirus 3 (feline bocavirus), with frequent coinfections of all three.Feline chaphamaparvovirus was only detected in healthy controls (6 out of 36,16.7%). Among the FPV-cases, in addition to FPV, the most abundant viruses wereMamastrovirus 2, feline coronavirus and C. bocaparvovirus 4 (felinebocaparvovirus 2). The latter and feline bocaparvovirus 3 were detectedsignificantly more frequently in FPV-cases than in healthy controls. Felinecalicivirus was present in a higher proportion of FPV-cases (11 out of 23, 47.8%)compared to healthy controls (5 out of 36, 13.9%, p = 0.0067). Feline kobuvirusinfections were also common among FPV-cases (9 out of 23, 39.1%) and were notdetected in any healthy controls (p < .0001). While abundant in both groups,astroviruses were more frequently present in FPV-cases (19 out of 23, 82.6%) thanin healthy controls (18 out of 36, p = .0142). The differences in eukaryoticvirome composition revealed here indicate that further investigations arewarranted to determine associations between enteric viral co-infections onclinical disease severity in cats with FPL.

TI  - Cross-modal facilitation of auditory discrimination in a frog.
PG  - 20220098
LID - 10.1098/rsbl.2022.0098 [doi]
AB  - Stimulation in one sensory modality can affect perception in a separate modality,resulting in diverse effects including illusions in humans. This can also result in cross-modal facilitation, a process where sensory performance in one modality is improved by stimulation in another modality. For instance, a simple sound can improve performance in a visual task in both humans and cats. However, the range of contexts and underlying mechanisms that evoke such facilitation effects remainpoorly understood. Here, we demonstrated cross-modal stimulation in wild-caughttungara frogs, a species with well-studied acoustic preferences in females. Wefirst identified that a combined visual and seismic cue (vocal sac movement andwater ripple) was behaviourally relevant for females choosing between twocourtship calls in a phonotaxis assay. We then found that this combinedcross-modal stimulus rescued a species-typical acoustic preference in thepresence of background noise that otherwise abolished the preference. Theseresults highlight how cross-modal stimulation can prime attention in receivers toimprove performance during decision-making. With this, we provide the foundation for future work uncovering the processes and conditions that promote cross-modal facilitation effects.

TI  - Unusual diagnosis of feline cardiac lymphoma using cardiac needle biopsy.
PG  - 251
LID - 10.1186/s12917-022-03357-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac tumors in cats are relatively rare, with lymphoma accounting for more than half of all cases. However, feline cardiac lymphoma is oftendiagnosed post-mortem, and it is difficult to diagnose while the cat is stillalive. It is the first report of a direct, rather than estimative, diagnosis withcardiac needle biopsy of a living cat with cardiac lymphoma. CASE PRESENTATION: A3-year-old domestic short-haired male cat experienced loss of energy and loss of appetite. Thoracic radiography and transthoracic echocardiography showedcardiomegaly with slight pleural effusion and cardiac tamponade due topericardial effusion, respectively. In addition, partial hyperechoic andhypertrophy of the papillary muscle and myocardium were observed. Blood testshowed an increase in cardiac troponin I levels. Pericardial fluid, removed bypericardiocentesis, was analyzed; however, the cause could not be determined.With the owner's consent, pericardiectomy performed under thoracotomy revealed a discolored myocardium. Cardiac needle biopsy was performed with a 25G needle, anda large number of large atypical lymphocytes were collected; therefore, a direct diagnosis of cardiac lymphoma was made. Pathological examination of thepericardium diagnosed at a later date revealed T-cell large cell lymphoma. Thecat underwent chemotherapy followed by temporary remission but died 60 days afterthe diagnosis. Postmortem, two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography(data when alive) revealed an abnormal left ventricular myocardial deformation,which corresponded to the site of cardiac needle biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: This rarecase demonstrates that cardiac lymphoma should be added to the differentialdiagnosis in cats with myocardial hypertrophy and that the diagnosis can be made directly by thoracotomy and cardiac needle biopsy. In addition, the measurementof cardiac troponin I levels and local deformation analysis of the myocardium by two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography may be useful in the diagnosis of cardiac tumors.

AB  - This retrospective study provides an analysis of the prevalence and detectabilityof canine distemper virus (CDV), feline leukemia virus (FeLV), and felineimmunodeficiency virus (FIV) in ocelots (Leopardus pardalis) sheltered in a wild animal recovery center in Guayaquil, Ecuador. Blood samples of 19 rescued ocelotsfrom 2019-20 were analyzed using FeLV p27 antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbentassays (ELISA) and commercial insulated isothermal reverse transcriptase PCR(iiRT-PCR) kits. Using this PCR we detected positive results for CDV (4/ 17;23.5%) and FeLV (14/16; 87.5%), but not for FIV (0/8). Three previously positive cases of CDV and two of FeLV showed negative results on retesting 6 mo later.Moreover, a third analysis was conducted and was negative for CDV. Our resultssuggest that ocelots can recover from the local CDV and FeLV strains. An ELISAfor the FeLV p27 antigen showed no capability to detect FeLV in ocelots that wereconfirmed positive by iiRT-PCR. Regional lineages, viral virulence, and hostimmune response capabilities should be addressed in further research to informmanagement and decision making for wildlife conservation.

TI  - GLEAN: Generative Latent Bank for Image Super-Resolution and Beyond.
LID - 10.1109/TPAMI.2022.3186715 [doi]
AB  - We show that pre-trained Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) such as StyleGAN and BigGAN can be used as a latent bank to improve the performance of imagesuper-resolution. While most existing perceptual-oriented approaches attempt togenerate realistic outputs through learning with adversarial loss, our method,Generative LatEnt bANk (GLEAN), goes beyond existing practices by directlyleveraging rich and diverse priors encapsulated in a pre-trained GAN. But unlike prevalent GAN inversion methods that require expensive image-specificoptimization at runtime, our approach only needs a single forward pass forrestoration. GLEAN can be easily incorporated in a simple encoder-bank-decoderarchitecture with multi-resolution skip connections. Employing priors fromdifferent generative models allows GLEAN to be applied to diverse categories(e.g., human faces, cats, buildings, and cars). We further present a lightweight version of GLEAN, named LightGLEAN, which retains only the critical components inGLEAN. Notably, LightGLEAN consists of only 21% of parameters and 35% of FLOPswhile achieving comparable image quality. We extend our method to different tasksincluding image colorization and blind image restoration, and extensiveexperiments show that our proposed models perform favorably in comparison toexisting methods.

TI  - Sedation quality of alfaxalone associated with butorphanol, methadone orpethidine in cats injected into the supraspinatus or the quadriceps muscle.
PG  - e269-e280
LID - 10.1177/1098612X221104747 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the quality of sedation withthree different anaesthetic protocols (alfaxalone combined with butorphanol,methadone or pethidine) administered intramuscularly in cats, and to evaluate theinfluence of the injection site (between supraspinatus and quadriceps muscles) onthe onset and quality of sedation. METHODS: A total of 151 cats were selected forthis study. Cats were sedated with alfaxalone (3 mg/kg) combined with eitherbutorphanol (0.3 mg/kg; n = 50), methadone (0.3 mg/kg; n = 53) or pethidine (5mg/kg; n = 48). The combination was injected intramuscularly into thesupraspinatus (n = 79) or quadriceps muscle (n = 72). The data included a scoringsystem for the quality of sedation and physiological parameters, such as heartrate (HR), respiratory rate, body temperature and occurrence of mydriasis,monitored during the first 30 mins of anaesthesia. RESULTS: The opioid associatedwith alfaxalone influenced the overall sedation score, the degree ofmyorelaxation, the occurrence of mydriasis and HR. The overall sedation score waspoorer with butorphanol than with methadone (P = 0.008), and butorphanol induced a lower degree of myorelaxation than methadone (P = 0.013). The injection intothe supraspinatus showed better qualitative results for sedation and a fasteronset time (in about 3 mins) than that into the quadriceps (P <0.001). HRdecreased from baseline (P <0.001) and over time (P <0.001), mainly in cats ofthe butorphanol-supraspinatus and pethidine-quadriceps groups (P = 0.004). Theoccurrence of mydriasis was lower after butorphanol than after methadone andpethidine (P = 0.025), while the incidence of side effects did not differ amonggroups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: All three protocols provided a good quality ofsedation and allowed performing the scheduled procedure. Moreover, the injection into the supraspinatus muscle showed superior results in all the qualitativescores of sedation and quicker onset time than that into the quadriceps muscle.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ear-tipping practices and the meaning of the ear tip intrap-neuter-return (TNR) programs have not been well documented. The purpose ofthis study was to report the frequency of common ear-tipping practices in theUSA, to identify the most effective methods and to establish a foundation forear-tipping practice standards. METHODS: An anonymous 24-question survey wasadvertised from 4 to 20 October 2021 to individuals who participate in TNRprograms that routinely perform ear tipping. RESULTS: There were 526 surveyresponses from individuals who participate in TNR programs, of whom 410 completedthe survey. For ear-tip meaning, nearly 100% of respondents indicated that an eartip meant that a cat had been sterilized. Several respondents answered that italso indicated rabies vaccination or socialization status, with 92 (22%)selecting both, 79 (19%) selecting rabies only and 50 (12%) selecting unsocialonly. The majority of respondents tipped the left ear (81%), used a visualestimate to determine the cut (92%) and described the ideal silhouette asstraight across (92%). The median percentage of cats where ear tips bled afterinitial hemostasis was 5% (interquartile range [IQR] 2-10), and the medianpercentage of negative feedback regarding the ear tip was 1% (IQR 0-5). In terms of weighted rank order, the most common feedback was that too much ear tip wasremoved (5.5), followed by a cat being ear tipped in error (4.7), persistentbleeding (4.2) and not enough ear tip being removed (4.2). Responses revealedheterogeneity regarding technique for both excision and hemostasis, as well aspersonnel performing the procedure. There were no significant associationsbetween techniques and bleeding or negative feedback. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: There is variation in the methods for performing an ear tip, as well as what anear tip signifies. Standards for this procedure would be helpful.

LID - 10.1177/1098612X221107795 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerabilityof a 4% tetrasodium EDTA (tEDTA) infusion protocol in the subcutaneous ureteralbypass (SUB) devices of cats with intraluminal obstruction at a veterinaryteaching hospital between July 2017 and April 2020. METHODS: This was aretrospective controlled study. Cats with an obstructed SUB device underwent a 4%tEDTA infusion protocol. Obstruction of the device was diagnosed based on renalpelvic dilation, dilatation of the ureter, mineralized material within the device(cystostomy or nephrostomy catheters) seen on ultrasound, the absence of visible bubbles within the renal pelvis and/or urinary bladder followingultrasound-guided flushing of the device with saline. RESULTS: A total of 16tEDTA infusion protocols were performed in 14 cats. The infusion protocol wasconsidered successful in 11/16 SUB devices (68.8%). Six devices (n = 6/11; 54.5%)had recurrence of obstruction with a median time of 87 days. One or more episodesof self-limiting pollakiuria and/or hematuria following infusion was seen ineight patients (n = 8/14; 57.1%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Infusions of 4%tEDTA successfully relieved intraluminal obstruction in patients with occludedSUB devices; however, the recurrence of obstruction was common. Additionalstudies evaluating case selection and optimal protocols are warranted.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were two-fold: (1) to determine if afeeder system providing individualized food access and automatic dispensing ofmeals makes weight-loss programs in multi-cat homes easier for cat owners; and(2) to assess if feeding six meals daily reduces food-seeking behavior andincreases calorie requirements vs two meals per day. METHODS: Adult cats withbody condition scores (BCSs) of 7/9 or greater underwent a weight-loss plan forup to 6 months using a traditional feeding bowl with two meals per day (B2) or anautomatic feeder with two meals (A2) or six meals (A6) per day. Cats were weighedat weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22 and 26 and food intake was adjusted tomaintain weight-loss rates between 0.5% and 1.5% body weight per week. Ownerquestionnaires were completed at each study visit. RESULTS: Twenty-three catswere included in the study. Cats fed from the automatic feeders were more likely to reach ideal body condition (P = 0.006), with 83.2% of cats in A6, 40% of cats in A2 and no cats in B2 achieving a BCS of 6/9. Owners of cats fed from automaticfeeders reported the weight-loss plan was easier vs owners of cats fed from bowls(P = 0.01). Owners using the automatic feeders also reported fewer incidences of certain food-seeking behaviors. Neither percent body weight lost per week norcalorie intake per kg differed between groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Feedingsix instead of two meals daily did not result in faster rates of weight loss orthe need to increase calorie intake to maintain appropriate rates of weight loss.However, use of an automatic feeder that provided separated, portioned mealfeeding made the weight-loss program easier, reduced food-seeking behaviors andimproved the overall success of the weight-loss plan.

AB  - CASE SERIES SUMMARY: Cats with non-erosive immune-mediated polyarthritis (IMPA)were identified from seven referral hospitals between 2009 and 2020 for amulticentre retrospective case series. Data were obtained from hospital recordsand referring veterinarians were contacted for follow-up. Twenty cases wereidentified: 12 castrated males (60%), one entire male (5%) and seven spayedfemales (35%). Common clinical signs included lameness (n = 20/20) and pyrexia (n= 10/18). Three cats presented with and two cats developed ligament laxity duringtreatment. Thirteen cats (65%) were diagnosed with non-associative IMPA and seven(35%) with associative IMPA. Comorbidities identified included chronicenteropathy (n = x/7), feline immunodeficiency virus (n = x/7) feline herpesvirus(n = x/7), bronchopneumonia (n = x/7) and discospondylitis (n = x/7). Sampling ofthe tarsal joints most frequently identified an increased proportion ofneutrophils, consistent with IMPA. Eighteen cats (90%) receivedimmunosuppressants. Eleven cats were started on prednisolone; eight had a poorresponse resulting in the addition of a second agent, euthanasia or acceptance ofthe persisting signs. One cat received ciclosporin and required an alternativesecond agent owing to adverse effects. Five cats were started on prednisolone andciclosporin; three had a poor response and required an alternative second agent. One cat received prednisolone and chlorambucil and had a good response. Two cats (10%) received meloxicam and had a good response, although the clinical signsrecurred when medication was tapered. A good outcome was achieved in 14/20 cats(70%) with IMPA. In the cats with a poor outcome 4/6 were euthanased and 2/6 had chronic lameness. RELEVANCE AND NOVEL INFORMATION: Prognosis for feline IMPA can be good. Multimodal immunosuppression was often required. IMPA should beconsidered in lame cats, with or without pyrexia, when there is no evidence oftrauma or infection. The tarsal joints should be included in the multiple joints chosen for sampling. Ligament laxity can occur in non-erosive feline IMPA.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Home blood glucose monitoring using a portable blood glucose meter isimportant in the management of feline diabetes mellitus, but taking blood samplesmay be stressful for owners and cats. A flash glucose monitoring system measuringinterstitial glucose, such as the FreeStyle Libre, overcomes some of thesedrawbacks. The aim of this study was to evaluate the practical use and analyticaland clinical accuracy of the FreeStyle Libre in 41 client-owned diabetic cats.METHODS: In this prospective study, interstitial glucose concentrations weremeasured with the FreeStyle Libre and compared with blood glucose concentrations measured with a portable blood glucose meter (AlphaTRAK) on days 1, 7 or 8 and 14after application of the device. Cat behaviour during application, location, skinreaction at the attachment site and owner satisfaction were assessed. Accuracywas determined by fulfilment of ISO 15197:2013 criteria, including Bland-Altmanplotting and error grid analysis. RESULTS: Placing the device was easy, with 70% of cats showing no reaction. Most sensors were placed on the thoracic wall. Skin reactions at the attachment site were not present or mild in almost all cats.Owners were very satisfied with the use of the FreeStyle Libre. Median functionallife of the sensor was 10 days (range 1-14). Good correlation was found betweeninterstitial and blood glucose measurements (rho[r] = 0.88, P <0.0001).Fifty-three percent of interstitial glucose concentrations were within a maximum deviation of 15% from blood glucose concentrations and 92.7% were within the saferisk zones 0 and 1 of the surveillance error grid. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Theflash glucose monitoring system was easy to use and owners of diabetic cats were satisfied with its use. Although the device did not completely fulfil ISOrequirements, it is sufficiently accurate for glucose monitoring in diabeticcats.

AB  - A 5-mm diameter mass developed on the nasal planum of a 4.5-y-old castrated male domestic shorthaired cat; the mass was raised ~2 mm above the surrounding skin.Histology revealed focal thickening of the epidermis with marked orthokeratosis. Many of the epidermal cells within the mass had prominent papillomavirus-induced changes. A diagnosis of a viral papilloma was made, and a DNA sequence from anovel papillomavirus type was amplified from the lesion. Although the sequencewas most similar to other feline papillomavirus types, the low level ofsimilarity was suggestive of a novel papillomavirus genus. There has been norecurrence of the mass or development of additional lesions in the 6 mo since themass was removed. This is the third cutaneous papilloma reported in a cat; aputative feline papillomavirus type has not been identified previously withinthese lesions, to our knowledge. Our findings expand the range of lesionsassociated with papillomaviruses in cats and increase the number ofpapillomavirus types that infect cats.

AB  - Ependymoma, one of the most common gliomas in cats, occurs most often in thelateral and third ventricles and has variable histologic patterns that often formrosettes and pseudorosettes. Oligodendrocyte transcription factor (OLIG2) isexpressed in oligodendrocyte precursor cells and mature oligodendrocytes.Although widely used as a diagnostic marker for most gliomas, OLIG2 is reportedto have minimal immunolabeling in ependymomas. Here we characterize the OLIG2immunolabeling pattern in 19 cases of feline ependymoma, which occurredpredominantly in the lateral and third ventricles. Immunohistochemistry for GFAP was variable in 14 cases and was typically localized in the cytoplasmic processesof the neoplastic ependymal cells, especially in the rosettes and pseudorosettes.Nuclear OLIG2 immunolabeling was present in 17 cases and varied in intensity fromweak (4 cases) to strong (13 cases). The distribution of OLIG2 immunolabelingwithin the neoplasms included none (2 cases), <25% (7 cases), 25-50% (6 cases),51-75% (2 cases), and >75% (3 cases). OLIG2 immunolabeling intensity anddistribution is widespread in feline ependymoma, in contrast to ependymomas inother species, and should not be relied upon as a specific marker for felineoligodendroglioma.

TI  - Development of the Anger Children's Cognitive Error Scale and the AngerChildren's Automatic Thought Scale.
PG  - 1-12
LID - 10.1017/S135246582200025X [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Empirical studies between anger and anger-provoking cognitivevariables in children and adolescents are lacking, despite numerous studies oninternalising and externalising problems. AIM: The purpose of this study was todevelop new questionnaires for anger-provoking cognitive errors and automaticthoughts, and examine relationships between anger, cognitive errors, andautomatic thoughts in children and adolescents. METHOD: Participants were 485Japanese children and adolescents aged 9-15 years old (254 females; average age12.07; SD = 1.81). They completed the Anger Children's Cognitive Error Scale(A-CCES) and the Anger Children's Automatic Thought Scale (A-CATS), which weredeveloped in this study, as well as the Anger Scale for Children and Adolescents and the Japanese version of Short Spence Children's Anxiety Scale. RESULTS: Both the A-CCES and the A-CATS had adequate reliability (internal consistency) andvalidity (face validity, structural validity and construct validity). Ahierarchal regression analysis indicated that automatic thoughts were positively and moderately related to anger (beta = .37) after controlling for age, gender,anxiety symptoms, cognitive errors and interaction term. Moreover, a mediationanalysis indicated that automatic thoughts significantly mediated therelationship between cognitive errors and anger (indirect effect, 0.24; 95% CI:.020 to .036). CONCLUSIONS: This study developed the new questionnaires to assessanger-provoking cognitive errors and automatic thoughts. In addition, this study revealed that automatic thoughts rather than cognitive errors are associated withanger in children and adolescents.

PG  - 249
LID - 10.1186/s12917-022-03358-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This case report describes the clinical presentation, magneticresonance imaging (MRI) as well as the histopathological findings in an elderlycat with an intracranial cholesterol granuloma. CASE PRESENTATION: An11.5-year-old, male neutered cat was presented at the emergency service withdeteriorating behavioral changes including aggression, and progressivegeneralized ataxia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed alarge, well demarcated, inhomogeneous and contrast enhancing mass in the lateral ventricles with marked mass effect. Due to a poor clinical prognosis, the cat waseuthanized. Histological examination identified the mass as a bilateralcholesterol granuloma in the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricles.CONCLUSIONS: Although plexus cholesterol granulomas are rarely seen in cats, theyshould be considered as a differential diagnosis in elderly patients withneurological signs such as behavioral changes.

PG  - 10851
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-14211-z [doi]
AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanoparticles found in all biological fluids,capable of transporting biological material around the body. Extensive researchinto the physiological role of EVs has led to the development of the MinimalInformation for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles (MISEV) framework in 2018. Thisframework guides the standardisation of protocols in the EV field. To date, thefocus has been on EVs of human origin. As comparative medicine progresses, there has been a drive to study similarities between diseases in humans and animals. Tosuccessfully research EVs in felines, we must validate the application of theMISEV guidelines in this group. EVs were isolated from the plasma of healthyhumans and felines. EV characterisation was carried out according to the MISEVguidelines. Human and feline plasma showed a similar concentration of EVs,comparable expression of known EV markers and analogous particle to proteinratios. Mass spectrometry analyses showed that the proteomic signature of EVsfrom humans and felines were similar. Asymmetrical flow field flow fractionation,showed two distinct subpopulations of EVs isolated from human plasma, whereasonly one subpopulation was isolated from feline plasma. Metabolomic profilingshowed similar profiles for humans and felines. In conclusion, isolation, andcharacterisation of EVs from humans and felines show that MISEV2018 guidelinesmay also be applied to felines. Potential comparative medicine studies of EVs mayprovide a model for studying naturally occurring diseases in both humans andfelines.

AB  - Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a Gram-negative bacillus of the commensal flora ofdogs and cats that can cause infections in humans through bites, scratches orcontact with oral secretions. It can be difficult to identify in clinicalmicrobiology laboratories because of the need for specific culture media. Wepresent the case of a patient with no relevant medical history who was admittedwith septic shock, where blood smear examination was crucial for the etiologicdiagnosis of Capnocytophaga canimorsus infection. The patient was also diagnosed Pelger-Huet anomaly, a condition causing a defect in neutrophil chemotaxis, whichmay have contributed to the severity of the infection.

AB  - Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is a major member of the Caliciviridae.which is fatal to wild and domestic European rabbit. Because RHDV does notreproduce stably in vitro, molecular studies on this pathogen have been limited. Feline calicivirus (FCV), also a member of the Caliciviridae, reproduces well in vitro and is a good viral vector. As these viruses share similar genomicstructures, we hypothesized that a chimeric infectious clone could be constructedby replacing the corresponding regions of the FCV genome with the structuralproteins VP60 and VP10 and the 3' non-translated region of the RHDV genome.Transfection of the infectious clone into RK13 cells made it possible to rescuethe chimeric virus, named pseudoRHDV, which reproduced in an RK13 cell line with high titer. An infectious pseudoRHDV was produced, which proliferated in RK13cells to at least 15 generations. PseudoRHDV caused significant cytopathicchanges in the RK13 cells, with a viral titer was 9.74 log10 TCID50 / mL. ThepseudoRHDV constructed in this study will be helpful for investigating themolecular biology of RHDV, especially its interaction with the host. The modelcan also be used to explore some common laws between FCV and RHDV.

TI  - Higher hospitalization and mortality rates among SARS-CoV-2-infected persons inrural America.
LID - 10.1111/jrh.12689 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Rural communities are among the most underserved and resource-scarcepopulations in the United States. However, there are limited data on COVID-19outcomes in rural America. This study aims to compare hospitalization rates andinpatient mortality among SARS-CoV-2-infected persons stratified by residentialrurality. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study from the National COVID CohortCollaborative (N3C) assesses 1,033,229 patients from 44 US hospital systemsdiagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection between January 2020 and June 2021. Primaryoutcomes were hospitalization and all-cause inpatient mortality. Secondaryoutcomes were utilization of supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanicalventilation, vasopressor support, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, andincidence of major adverse cardiovascular events or hospital readmission. Theanalytic approach estimates 90-day survival in hospitalized patients andassociations between rurality, hospitalization, and inpatient adverse eventswhile controlling for major risk factors using Kaplan-Meier survival estimatesand mixed-effects logistic regression. FINDINGS: Of 1,033,229 diagnosed COVID-19 patients included, 186,882 required hospitalization. After adjusting fordemographic differences and comorbidities, urban-adjacent and nonurban-adjacentrural dwellers with COVID-19 were more likely to be hospitalized (adjusted oddsratio [aOR] 1.18, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-1.21 and aOR 1.29, CI1.24-1.1.34) and to die or be transferred to hospice (aOR 1.36, CI 1.29-1.43 and 1.37, CI 1.26-1.50), respectively. All secondary outcomes were more likely among rural patients. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalization, inpatient mortality, and otheradverse outcomes are higher among rural persons with COVID-19, even afteradjusting for demographic differences and comorbidities. Further research isneeded to understand the factors that drive health disparities in ruralpopulations.

TI  - Central modulation of cardiac baroreflex moment-to-moment sensitivity duringtreadmill exercise in conscious cats.
PG  - e15371
LID - 10.14814/phy2.15371 [doi]
AB  - It remains undetermined whether the cardiac component of the entire arterialbaroreflex is blunted even at the onset of low-intensity exercise. We sought toexamine the moment-to-moment sensitivity of the cardiac baroreflex during walkingat different speeds and the presumed mechanisms responsible for baroreflexmodulation in conscious cats. Arterial baroreflex sensitivity for heart rate was estimated from the baroreflex ratio between changes in systolic arterial bloodpressure and heart rate and from the slope of the baroreflex curve between thecardiovascular responses to brief occlusion of the abdominal aorta. Treadmillwalking was performed for 1 min at three levels of speed (low: 20-30 m/min,moderate: 40 m/min, and high: 50-60 m/min) or for 3 min at the stepwise change ofspeed (low to high to low transition). Cardiac baroreflex sensitivity was bluntedat the onset of walking, irrespective of speed. Thereafter, the blunted cardiacbaroreflex sensitivity was restored around 15 s of walking at any speed, whilethe blunting occurred again at 45 s of high-speed walking. The inhibition ofcardiac baroreflex sensitivity also occurred (1) during the speed transition fromlow to high and (2) at 45 s of high-speed exercise of the stepwise exercise. The blunted cardiac baroreflex sensitivity was restored immediately to the restinglevel during the speed transition from high to low, despite sustained pressor andtachycardiac responses. Therefore, moment-to-moment modulation of the cardiacbaroreflex during exercise would occur in association with motor intention (i.e.,exercise onset) and effort (i.e., treadmill speed).

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to collect data from a substantial numberof older cats having their systolic blood pressure (SBP) measured in a variety ofclinical practices, to describe the findings and assess variables that affectedthe duration of assessment and the values obtained. METHODS: An international(European-based) multicentre convenience sample survey of cats 7 years of ageattending veterinary clinics and having SBP measured as part of their clinicalassessment. Information gathered included details of the cat, concomitantdisease(s) or therapies, SBP results, device used, time taken to assess SBP andthe demeanor of the cat. RESULTS: Useable data were available from 8884 cats aged7-26 years, from 811 clinics across 16 countries. The device used to measure SBP was Doppler in 47.4% and oscillometry in 48.5%. The demeanor of the cat wasreported to be calm in 45.7%, anxious in 41.9% and nervous in 8.9%; and theduration of assessment was reported to be <5 mins in 50.4%, 5-10 minutes in 41.7%and >10 mins in 7.9%. Concomitant chronic kidney disease (CKD) was reported in21.8%, hyperthyroidism in 12.0% or both in 3.1%. The median SBP was 150 mmHg(range 80-310), with 18.6% classified as hypertensive (SBP 160-179 mmHg) and21.1% as severely hypertensive (SBP 180 mmHg). The measured SBP was significantlyaffected by the cat's demeanor, duration of SBP assessment, presence of CKDand/or hyperthyroidism, the cat's sex and age, and the presence of concomitanttherapy. The duration of SBP assessment was significantly affected by the cat'sdemeanor. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In veterinary clinics, SBP can be measuredin most cats within a short period of time using either Doppler or oscillometric equipment. The presence of CKD or hyperthyroidism was associated withsignificantly higher SBP values, and anxious or nervous cats had higher SBPvalues and took longer to obtain SBP assessments.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe the clinical picture in catswith alpha-chloralose (AC) intoxication and to confirm AC in serum from suspectedcases of AC poisoning. METHODS: Suspected cases of AC poisoning were identifiedin patient records from a small animal university hospital from January 2014 toFebruary 2020. Clinical signs of intoxication described in respective recordswere compiled, the cats were graded into four intoxication severity scores andhospitalisation time and mortality were recorded. Surplus serum from select casesin late 2019 and early 2020 was analysed to detect AC with a quantitativeultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis,and the AC concentration was compared with the respective cat's intoxicationseverity score. RESULTS: Serum from 25 cats was available for analysis and ACpoisoning was confirmed in all. Additionally, 78 cats with a clinical suspicionof AC intoxication were identified in the patient records, most of whichpresented from September to April. The most common signs of intoxication wereataxia, tremors, cranial nerve deficits and hyperaesthesia. The prevalence ofclinical signs and intoxication severity differed from what has previously beenreported, with our population presenting with less severe signs and no deaths dueto intoxication. The majority had a hospitalisation time <48 h, irrespective ofintoxication severity score. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study describes the clinical signs and prognosis in feline AC intoxication. There were no mortalitiesin confirmed cases, indicating that AC-poisoned cats have an excellent prognosis when treated in a timely manner. Recognition of AC intoxication as a differentialdiagnosis for acute onset of the described neurological signs in areas where ACexposure is possible may influence clinical decision-making and help avoidexcessive diagnostic procedures. A severe clinical picture upon presentationcould be misinterpreted as a grave prognosis and awareness about AC poisoning mayavoid unnecessary euthanasia.

AB  - Case series summary: In this report we describe the origin of protein loss anddevelopment of acute kidney injury after ibuprofen intoxication in two cats. Two 13-month-old neutered male domestic shorthair siblings were presented with acute kidney injury (AKI) and severe glomerular proteinuria following witnessedibuprofen intoxication 3 days prior. Both cats presented with severe azotaemia(creatinine >900 micromol/l [>10 mg/dl]) and severe proteinuria (urineprotein:creatinine [UPC] >20, normal <0.5). Urine protein electrophoresis uponpresentation revealed mainly albumin and primary glomerular protein losses. Theproteinuria and azotaemia resolved completely within 5 days of hospital treatment(8 days after ingestion). Urine protein electrophoresis, once the azotaemia andproteinuria resolved (UPC 0.11; normal <0.5), had a similar pattern to the onefrom admission. Both cats made a full recovery with supportive care. Relevanceand novel information: This is the first clinical report of AKI withnephrotic-range protein losses following ibuprofen intoxication in cats. Wepropose that this finding is due to idiosyncratic glomerular injury, as describedin humans.

AB  - Cats are susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) infection and risk transmitting viruses to naive cats or humans.Here, based on our novel adenovirus-vectored COVID-19 vaccine, the immunogenicityof Sad23L-nCoV-S vaccine was evaluated in cats by prime-boost vaccinations. Five cats were primed with a dose of 10(8) plaque-forming units (PFUs) Sad23L-nCoV-Svaccine and then boosted with an equal dose of same vaccine at a 4-week interval.Cat serum neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers (the sample dilution at which 50%inhibitory concentration [IC50]) were measured as IC50 15,849 to wild-typestrain, IC50 6,591 to Alpha, IC50 2,315 to Beta, IC50 2,744 to Gamma, IC50 1,848 to Delta, and IC50 318 to Omicron variants of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 viruses atweek 6 post-prime vaccination. All NAb levels to these five variants were >/=IC5049 from vaccinated cats at week 10, while 48.8% to Delta and 100% to Omicronvariants were <IC50 10 from human vaccinees at week 2 or 4 after receiving twoinjections of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Robust T cell response ofinterferon (IFN)-gamma to S peptides were detected in vaccinated cats. It wasconcluded that Sad23L-nCoV-S vaccine could be a promising vaccine candidateagainst SARS-CoV-2 infection in cats by prime or plus boost vaccinations.

AB  - This retrospective case series describes imaging findings in seven dogs and twocats with a presumptive diagnosis of sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis (SEP)between 2014 and 2021. Peritoneal effusion was present in all animal patients.Sonographically, echogenic fluid with or without echogenic intraperitonealseptations, gathered or corrugated bowel loops, and abdominal lymphadenomegalywere suggesting an inflammatory process and the presence of adhesions. Gathering of the bowel with abdominal distension and/or signs of intestinal obstructionwere major findings on radiographs. Abdominal fat stranding was an additionalfinding in animals undergoing a CT examination. Previous surgery, pregnancy, and the presence of a perforating foreign body were potential predisposing causes in 4/9 animals. Peritonitis was septic in 4/9 animals. As SEP is a rare conditionbut life threatening, this detailed description of imaging findings in a shortcase series can be useful for a presumptive diagnosis and surgical planning.

TI  - Increasing Engagement in Kitten Fostering Programs: Lessons Learned From HighKitten Intake Zip Codes in Los Angeles County.
PG  - 897687
LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.897687 [doi]
AB  - The goal of the current study was to identify ways to increase awareness andengagement in kitten fostering programs (KFPs) among residents of areas with ahigh intake of kittens to animal shelters in Southern California (i.e., LosAngeles County). Specifically, we aimed to understand residents': (1) awarenessof KFPs and kitten overpopulation issues, (2) interest in fostering kittens with an animal welfare organization, (3) concerns about fostering, (4) perceivedability to meet common KFP requirements, and (5) perceptions of potential KFPmarketing/messaging and communication methods. Participants included 283,predominantly Hispanic/Latinx adults aged 18 years or older who resided in LosAngeles County and who lived in one of 12 zip codes with a high rate of kittenshelter intake. Survey results indicated that more than one quarter ofparticipants had engaged in fostering on their own without an animal shelter orrescue program. One-third of the total sample, and more than two-thirds ofparticipants who had already fostered cats and kittens on their own, were open tofostering kittens in partnership with an animal shelter. A majority ofindividuals who were interested in fostering had not seen advertising forfostering programs; Spanish-language participants were significantly less likely than expected to have encountered program advertisements. The most prevalentconcerns about fostering in our sample were centered on the time (79%), cost(78%), and space (77%) required to engage in fostering. Text, email, socialmedia, and mail were among the most preferred methods for marketing andcommunication, with some variation between Spanish and English languagerespondents. Opportunities for increasing engagement included, but were notlimited to, improving the promotion of program advertisements usinganimal-welfare and cost-focused messaging approaches and improving thedissemination and marketing of Spanish-language materials. Providing communitymembers with realistic expectations of the time, resources, and support they willget from animal welfare organizations may improve engagement in KFPs, as well as identifying alternative resources and supports (e.g., transportation, in-homeveterinary visits) to assist community members in serving animals in theircommunity.

AB  - Companion animals are susceptible to a variety of coronaviruses, and recentstudies show that felines are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. RT-PCR diagnostic is currently the method of choice to detect the presence ofSARS-CoV-2-specific viral nucleic acids in animal samples during an activeinfection; however, serological assays are critical to determine whether animals were exposed to the virus and to determine the seroprevalence ofSARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in a defined population. In this study, weutilized recombinant nucleocapsid (N) protein and the receptor-binding domain(RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 expressed in E. coli (N) and mammaliancells (N, RBD) to develop indirect ELISA (iELISA) tests using well-characterized SARS-CoV-2-positive and -negative cat serum panels from previous experimental catchallenge studies. The optimal conditions for the iELISA tests were establishedbased on checkerboard dilutions of antigens and antibodies. The diagnosticsensitivity for the detection of feline antibodies specific for the N or RBDproteins of the iELISA tests was between 93.3 and 97.8%, respectively, and thediagnostic specificity 95.5%. The iELISAs developed here can be used forhigh-throughput screening of cat sera for both antigens. The presence ofSARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in a BSL-2 biocontainment environment, unlikevirus neutralization tests with live virus which have to be performed in BSL-3laboratories.

TI  - Expression of L-type amino acid transporter 1 in canine and feline intracranialtumors.
PG  - 1111-1117
LID - 10.1292/jvms.21-0646 [doi]
AB  - L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) is upregulated in various malignant tumorsin humans. LAT1 expression correlates with the grade of cancer and prognosis.LAT1 is responsible for the supply of many essential amino acids to cancer cells.Inhibition of LAT1 reduces the amino acids that enter the cell and inhibitscancer cell growth. Therefore, novel anticancer drugs targeting LAT1 haveattracted much attention in recent years. In this study, to explore theapplicability of using LAT1 expression in intracranial tumors as a prognosticfactor and therapeutic target, we investigated the expression of LAT1 insurgically resected primary and secondary intracranial tumor tissues from dogsand cats. Immunohistochemical analysis of LAT1 was performed on intracranialtumor tissue from 14 dogs and 3 cats. Primary intracranial tumors were seen in 10dogs and included meningiomas, histiocytic sarcomas, pituitary tumors, andgliomas, and 9 out of 10 cases were positive for LAT1. Primary intracranialtumors were seen in 2 cats and included meningioma and lymphoma; both cases were positive for LAT1. Secondary intracranial tumors were positive for LAT1 in 3 out of 4 cases in dogs and 1 out of 1 in cats. Since the majority of intracranialtumors in dogs and cats were positive for LAT1, immunostaining for LAT1 isexpected to be a prognostic indicator and therapeutic target in the future.

AB  - The Monkeypox virus belongs to the Orthopoxvius genus, as does the specificallyhuman smallpox virus. It is zoonotic and had never previously been considered as capable of human-to-human transmission over more than nine viral generationcycles. While relevant animal reservoirs have yet to be identified, non-humanprimates (NHP) are only accidental hosts. The potentially high number of current human shedders during the clinical phase (3 weeks maximum) raises the question ofa risk in our countries of animals being contaminated by infected humans (reversezoonosis). Cats as well as cows are susceptible to the Cowpox virus, anotherzoonotic Orthopoxvirus, which they transmit to humans. Dogs are much lesssusceptible to this virus and seem only receptive to Vaccinia virus (alsobelonging to the Orthopoxvirus genus). On the other hand, one study hasdemonstrated the pronounced susceptibility of the adult albino rabbit and ofyoung animals of several rodent species to Monkeypox virus (MPXV). Given thesusceptibility to MPXV of prairie dogs, which are American Sciuridae, thepotential for infection of European squirrels cannot be ruled out.

AB  - The long-standing nativist vs. empiricist debate asks a foundational question in epistemology - does our knowledge arise through experience or is it availableinnately? Studies that probe the sensitivity of newborns and patients recovering from congenital blindness are central in informing this dialogue. One of the mostrobust sensitivities our visual system possesses is to 'biological motion' - the movement patterns of humans and other vertebrates. Various biological motionperception skills (such as distinguishing between movement of human and non-humananimals, or between upright and inverted human movement) become evident withinthe first months of life. The mechanisms of acquiring these capabilities, andspecifically the contribution of visual experience to their development, arestill under debate. We had the opportunity to directly examine the role of visualexperience in biological motion perception, by testing what level of sensitivity is present immediately upon onset of sight following years of congenital visualdeprivation. Two congenitally blind patients who underwent sight-restorativecataract-removal surgery late in life (at the ages of 7 and 20 years) were testedbefore and after sight restoration. The patients were shown displays of walkinghumans, pigeons, and cats, and asked to describe what they saw. Visualrecognition of movement patterns emerged immediately upon eye-opening followingsurgery, when the patients spontaneously began to identify human, but not animal,biological motion. This recognition ability was evident contemporaneously forupright and inverted human displays. These findings suggest that visualrecognition of human motion patterns may not critically depend on visualexperience, as it was evident upon first exposure to un-obstructed sight inpatients with very limited prior visual exposure, and furthermore, was notlimited to the typical (upright) orientation of humans in real-life settings.

TI  - Retrospective evaluation of the outcome and prognosis of undergoing positivepressure ventilation due to cardiac and noncardiac causes in dogs and cats(2019-2020): 101 cases.
LID - 10.1111/vec.13224 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the short- and long-term outcomes of dogs and cats withleft-sided congestive heart failure (L-CHF) undergoing positive pressureventilation (PPV) to patients undergoing PPV for other causes and to determinerisk factors associated with outcomes in this population. DESIGN: Thisretrospective study included dogs and cats that underwent PPV during 2018-2020.The study group included patients diagnosed with L-CHF. The control groupincluded patients who were ventilated for reasons other than L-CHF. The riskfactors evaluated included vital signs on presentation, ventilator settings,development of azotemia during hospitalization, cardiopulmonary resuscitation(CPR), complications, and medications used. SETTING: University TeachingHospital. ANIMALS: Fifty (32 dogs, 18 cats) study group animals and 51 (39 dogs, 12 cats) control group animals were included in the L-CHF and control groups,respectively. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sixty-six percent (33/50) of L-CHFpatients, compared with 35% (18/51) of the control patients, were weaned off PPV (P = 0.002). Fifty-four percent (27/50) of the L-CHF patients survived todischarge, compared with 26% (13/51) of the control group patients (P = 0.003).However, only 54% (12/22) of the discharged L-CHF patients survived for >2 monthscompared to 100% of the control patients. The median survival time for dogs andcats with L-CHF surviving to discharge was 240 days (range: 1-730 days). In dogs,factors negatively associated with survival included CPR in both groups and thedevelopment of azotemia in the L-CHF group. Anemia on presentation was negativelyassociated with survival for both cats and dogs in the control group.CONCLUSIONS: Dogs and cats undergoing PPV due to L-CHF were more commonly weaned off the ventilator and survived to discharge compared to other causesnecessitating PPV. However, these patients suffer from severe heart disease, and therefore, their long-term survival is guarded.

AB  - Host genetic resistance to viral infection controls the pathogenicity andepidemic dynamics of infectious diseases. Refrex-1 is a restriction factoragainst feline leukemia virus subgroup D (FeLV-D) and an endogenous retrovirus(ERV) in domestic cats (ERV-DC). Refrex-1 is encoded by a subset of ERV-DC lociwith truncated envelope genes and secreted from cells as a soluble protein. Here,we identified the copper transporter CTR1 as the entry receptor for FeLV-D andgenotype I ERV-DCs. We also identified CTR1 as a receptor for primate ERVs fromcrab-eating macaques and rhesus macaques, which were found in a search of intact envelope genes capable of forming infectious viruses. Refrex-1 counteractedinfection by FeLV-D and ERV-DCs via competition for the entry receptor CTR1; the antiviral effects extended to primate ERVs with CTR1-dependent entry.Furthermore, truncated ERV envelope genes found in chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla,crab-eating macaque, and rhesus macaque genomes could also block infection byfeline and primate retroviruses. Genetic analyses showed that these ERV envelope genes were acquired in a species- or genus-specific manner during host evolution.These results indicated that soluble envelope proteins could suppress retroviral infection across species boundaries, suggesting that they function to controlretroviral spread. Our findings revealed that several mammalian species acquired antiviral machinery from various ancient retroviruses, leading to convergentevolution for host defense.

TI  - Awareness of Pet Owners in Riyadh Regarding Pet-Related Health Risks and TheirAssociated Preventative Measures.
LID - 10.1089/vbz.2022.0017 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: This study aims to determine the sociodemographic characteristics of pet owners and their sources of information regarding pet-related health risks.It also assesses pet owners' perception of pet-related health risks and evaluatestheir attitudes and practices regarding preventative measures toward pet-related health risks. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Riyadh, SaudiArabia from September 2020 to February 2021. The target population was pet ownersvisiting pet stores. The city was divided into five equal sectors and data werecollected from each sector using a questionnaire. Results: A total of 508participants were engaged in the study. Of these, 402 participants fit theinclusion criteria. The mean age of the participants was 25.5 years. Gender wasalmost equally distributed, and the majority of participants were single, howevermost of the participants lived with four or more family members. Around 49.5% of participants had household members at a higher risk for pet-related diseases. Themost common pet types were cats (77.4%), followed by birds (24.6%) and dogs(9.7%). Most participants were satisfied with their understanding of pet-related health risks and were not concerned about getting sick because of contact withpets. Physical harm was the most common pet-related health risk that theparticipants were satisfied with their level of understanding about, on the otherhand their satisfaction with their understanding about gastrointestinalinfections from pet contact was the lowest. Most participants had good pethusbandry and hygiene practices. Social media and veterinarians were the mostcommon sources of information regarding pet-related health risks. Conclusion:Although most pet owners reported having good pet husbandry practices, furthereducation is needed to raise awareness about pet-related health risks. Since mostpet owners receive their information about this topic from social media andveterinarians, further education through these platforms might be beneficial.

AB  - Feline sporotrichosis is a major clinical problem among cats in Brazil and isalso a neglected, but important, public health issue, due to its zoonoticpotential. The nasal clinical form of the disease is particularly challenging,having treatment refractoriness and clinical signs relapse as common features.This case series study aimed to preliminarily describe the effects of the azolic antifungal drug, clotrimazole, as a topical 1% solution spray, together with per os itraconazole on inducing disease remission, as well as treatment tolerability and safety. Medical records of the Feline Medicine Service from the Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro were reviewed, and 7 feline patients met theinclusion criteria (confirmatory diagnostic reached, available follow-up records,and use of intranasal clotrimazole 1% solution -1 spray per nostril every 24hours- as adjunctive therapy to itraconazole - 100 mg/cat per os every 24 hours).Among these, 4 had a history of treatment refractoriness done until then.Follow-up records included clinical evaluation, along with complementary testsand owner reports on tolerability and occurrence of adverse reactions. Allpatients have undergone clinical remission within 60 days. Tolerability weresatisfactory, and adverse reactions were only found on complementary tests(hepatic enzyme elevation), without clinical repercussion. The intranasal use of 1% clotrimazole solution has shown as a promising adjunctive therapy toitraconazole for feline nasal sporotrichosis, even in previous refractory cases.

LID - 10.29374/2527-2179.bjvm000421 [doi]
AB  - The epidemiological role of cats in the coronavirus disease pandemic remainsunclear despite of several studies that have been conducted to understand it, in other words it is not yet known whether the cat would be able to transmit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to humans. Taking that intoaccount, the objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review toidentify what is known and not known on this topic. Our results revealed thatcats can be infected through an airborne (perhaps oral, too) route and that theclinical development of the infection in cats is parallel to that in humans. The majority of infected cats remained asymptomatic, and more severe clinical casesdescribed occurred only in animals with comorbidities. In addition to infection, cats achieved seroconversion with detectable titers. However, the epidemiologicalrole of cats in relation to transmission routes of severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains unclear and needs to be studiedfurther. We emphasize that, regardless of the conclusion regarding theepidemiological role of cats, this reinforces the concepts of ONE HEALTH to beincorporated into the studies and practices of epidemiological surveillance ofinfectious diseases, with multidisciplinary teams, to achieve an understanding ofthe transmission of diseases with zoonotic potential.

TI  - Radioiodine treatment of hyperthyroidism in cats: results of 165 cats treated by an individualised dosing algorithm in Spain.
PG  - e258-e268
LID - 10.1177/1098612X221104743 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although radioiodine ((131)I) is the treatment of choice for felinehyperthyroidism, (131)I-dosing protocols commonly induce iatrogenichypothyroidism and expose azotaemia. A recently reported patient-specific (131)I dosing algorithm minimised the risk of (131)I-induced hypothyroidism andazotaemia, while maintaining high cure rates. The aim of the study was to report results of (131)I treatment in a European population of hyperthyroid cats usingthis patient-specific dosing algorithm. METHODS: This prospective case series(before-and-after study) evaluated 165 hyperthyroid cats referred for (131)Itreatment. All cats had serum concentrations of thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measured (off methimazole 1 week).Thyroid volume and percentage uptake of (99m)Tc-pertechnetate (TcTU) weredetermined using thyroid scintigraphy. An initial (131)I dose was calculated byaveraging dose scores for T4/T3 concentrations, thyroid volume and TcTU; 70% ofthat composite dose was then administered. Twenty-four hours later, percentage(131)I uptake was measured, and additional (131)I administered as needed todeliver an adequate radiation dose to the thyroid tumour(s). Serum concentrationsof T4, TSH and creatinine were determined 6-12 months later. RESULTS: Mediancalculated (131)I dose was 2.15 mCi (range 1.2-7.5), with only 51 (30.9%)receiving 2.5 mCi. Of 165 cats, 124 (75.2%) became euthyroid, seven (4.2%) becameovertly hypothyroid, 27 (16.4%) became subclinically hypothyroid and seven (4.2%)remained hyperthyroid. A higher proportion of overtly (85.7%) and subclinically(26.9%) hypothyroid cats developed azotaemia than euthyroid cats (13.6%; P =0.0002). Hypothyroid cats were older (P = 0.016) and more likely to havedetectable TSH concentrations (P = 0.025) and symmetrical bilateral distribution of (99m)Tc-pertechnetate uptake (P = 0.0002), whereas persistently hyperthyroidcats had higher severity scores (P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Ourresults confirm that (131)I dosing with this new algorithm results in high curerates, with a lowered prevalence of (131)I-induced overt hypothyroidism andazotaemia. Age, serum TSH concentrations, bilateral, symmetrical uptake andseverity score help predict outcome.

TI  - Pegylated asparaginase in feline high-grade lymphoma: clinical results of single injection and continued incorporation into a modified COP regimen.
PG  - e203-e213
LID - 10.1177/1098612X221101533 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the response to a single injection of pegylated asparaginase ('pegaspargase') and to assess thetolerability and outcome of prolonged incorporation of pegaspargase into amodified COP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone) regimen inpegaspargase sensitive cats. METHODS: Fifty-six client-owned cats with confirmed macroscopic high-grade lymphoma at any anatomical site were included. Treatmentwas commenced with a single pegaspargase injection. Cats showing an objectiveresponse were eligible to continue therapy with pegaspargase incorporated into a modified COP protocol and had their survival analysed using the Kaplan-Meiermethod and log-rank test. RESULTS: Objective response to pegaspargase wasreported in 46 cats (82%), including 21 (38%) complete and 25 (44%) partialresponses. Thirty-four responders continued therapy with pegaspargase-COP as the first-line treatment. Of these, 31 cats (92%) achieved complete remission with a median duration of the first remission (disease-free survival [DFS]) of 816 days.The median overall survival time (OST) for all 34 cats treated withpegaspargase-COP was 181 days. Response to the initial pegaspargase injectionbefore COP initiation was significantly associated with DFS (P = 0.04) and OST (P= 0.001). Median DFS/OST for cats with complete response to initial pegaspargase injection was significantly longer compared with those with partial remission(>1273 days/>2066 days vs 77 days/108 days, respectively). Cats with gastriclymphoma showed a significantly longer survival (OST 854 days, 1- and 2-yearsurvival rate 57.1%) compared with cats with intestinal lymphoma (OST 102 days,1-year survival rate 0%). The pegaspargase-COP protocol was generally welltolerated, but two deaths were likely attributable to treatment-related toxicity during the maintenance phase. Importantly, none of the cats experiencedhypersensitivity, despite multiple repeated treatments with pegaspargase.CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Pegaspargase is an effective agent for feline lymphoma.Its incorporation into a COP chemotherapy protocol may confer a survival benefit,especially in cats with complete response to pegaspargase. Treatment is generallywell tolerated, but careful monitoring is recommended. Further studies arerequired to assess the benefits of pegaspargase as monotherapy or as part ofdifferent multi-agent chemotherapy regimens.

TI  - Urine bacterial culture growth and association with urine sedimentation andclinical findings in cats with acute kidney injury.
PG  - 1098612X221105309

AB  - OBJECTIVES: A urine culture is often pursued in cats with acute kidney injury(AKI) to screen for bacterial growth in the urine, but it can be costprohibitive. The aim of the study was to determine the ability of a urinalysisand lower urinary tract signs (LUTS) to predict urine culture results in catswith AKI. METHODS: Ninety-seven cats with AKI were included in this study. Thiswas a retrospective, observational study. Medical records from 2008 to 2018 were reviewed to identify cats with AKI that had a paired urinalysis and urinebacterial culture. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value andnegative predictive values of microscopic bacteriuria, pyuria, hematuria and the presence of LUTS for predicting urine culture results was calculated. RESULTS:Thirty-two percent of cats (n = 31) had a positive urine culture. Of these, 28(90%) had bacteriuria, 21 (68%) had pyuria, 13 (42%) had hematuria and 10 (32%)had LUTS. Of the 42 cats without hematuria or pyuria, seven had a positive urine culture (17%). Bacteriuria had a high sensitivity (90%) and specificity (92%) forpredicting urine culture bacterial growth. The absence of bacteriuria had a high negative predictive value for no bacterial growth (95%). The odds of a positiveurine culture were increased with bacteriuria (odds ratio [OR] 114, 95%confidence interval [CI] 29-621; P <0.001), pyuria (OR 21, 95% CI 7-70; P <0.001)and LUTS (OR 5, 95% CI 1.7-16; P = 0.004). Hematuria was not associated with apositive culture (sensitivity 42%, specificity 52%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:Microscopic bacteriuria and pyuria on urine sediment evaluation and LUTS can behelpful for predicting bacterial culture results in cats with AKI and in settingswhere submitting a urine culture may not be financially feasible.

TI  - Genomic analyses show extremely perilous conservation status of African andAsiatic cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus).
LID - 10.1111/mec.16577 [doi]
AB  - We live in a world characterized by biodiversity loss and global environmentalchange. The extinction of large carnivores can have ramifying effects onecosystems like an uncontrolled increase in wild herbivores, which in turn canhave knock-on impacts on vegetation regeneration and communities. Cheetahs(Acinonyx jubatus) serve important ecosystem functions as apex predators; yet,they are quickly heading towards an uncertain future. Threatened by habitat loss,human-wildlife conflict and illegal trafficking, there are only approximately7100 individuals remaining in nature. We present the most comprehensivegenome-wide analysis of cheetah phylogeography and conservation genomics to date,assembling samples from nearly the entire current and past species' range. Weshow that their phylogeography is more complex than previously thought, and that East African cheetahs (A. j. raineyi) are genetically distinct from SouthernAfrican individuals (A. j. jubatus), warranting their recognition as a distinctsubspecies. We found strong genetic differentiation between all classicallyrecognized subspecies, thus refuting earlier findings that cheetahs show onlylittle differentiation. The strongest differentiation was observed between theAsiatic and all the African subspecies. We detected high inbreeding in theCritically Endangered Iranian (A. j. venaticus) and North-western (A. j. hecki)subspecies, and show that overall cheetahs, along with snow leopards, have thelowest genome-wide heterozygosity of all the big cats. This further emphasizesthe cheetah's perilous conservation status. Our results provide novel andimportant information on cheetah phylogeography that can support evidence-basedconservation policy decisions to help protect this species. This is especiallyrelevant in light of ongoing and proposed translocations across subspeciesboundaries, and the increasing threats of illegal trafficking.

AB  - Animal shelters play a vital role for pets, such as transitioning animals betweenhomes, from outdoor communities into homes, caring for unadoptable and community animals, and providing a breadth of veterinary and welfare services. The goal of shelters is to move cats to their appropriate outcome as quickly as possible,which for many animals, is to rehome them as quickly as possible throughadoption. Therefore, the ability to identify pre-existing factors, particularlythose occurring outside the walls of the shelter, which result in specificoutcomes is vital. In this study, we used structural equation modeling to testfour hypotheses addressing how to predict cat outcome from a shelter inWashington, D.C. We developed four hypotheses that described how cat outcomescould be predicted, based on four general factors: (1) The characteristics of thecats; (2) The location of origin; (3) The type and date of intake; (4) The lengthof stay. Using 4 years of data from the Humane Rescue Alliance in Washington,D.C., we found support for each of our hypotheses. Additionally, we tested andfound support for a global model, which comprised an amalgamation of our all our predictors. From the global model, we can conclude that many factors are at play in predicting cat outcomes in this shelter and very likely in many others aswell. Critically, these factors are interconnected, indicating, for example, thatcat characteristics mediate the influence of intake location on outcome type.Furthermore, our study highlights the importance of incorporating influencesbeyond the shelter when attempting to understand cat outcomes. Therefore, tomodify cat outcomes most efficiently, such as increasing adoption probabilities, our results show that efforts may be most effective when incorporating multiplefactors.

LID - 10.3390/v14061248 [doi]
AB  - (1) Background: This study aimed to determine the risk factors for outbreaks offeline panleukopenia in shelters. (2) Methods: Four shelters (A-D) with 150 cats were included. Fecal samples were analyzed by parvovirus real-time polymerasechain reaction (qPCR), including culture and sequencing of qPCR-positive samples.Information on cats, husbandry, hygiene, and infection management was evaluatedto determine risk factors for feline panleukopenia and parvovirus shedding bylogistic regression. (3) Results: Feline panleukopenia occurred in 28.0% (42/150)of cats (0 in shelter D). Shedding was found in 48.7% (73/150) (A: 21/73; B:29/73; C: 7/73; D: 16/73). Of 73 qPCR-positive fecal samples, 65.8% (48/73) were culture-positive; sequencing revealed feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) isolatesin 34/48 samples and vaccine virus isolate in 14/48; canine parvovirus was notdetected. Presence of feline panleukopenia was significantly more likely in cats from shelter A (p &lt; 0.05), unvaccinated cats (p &lt; 0.001), and young cats (4weeks to 2 years; p = 0.008). Parvovirus shedding was significantly more commonin young cats (p &lt; 0.001), cats with feline panleukopenia (p = 0.033), andgroup-housed cats (p = 0.025). (4) Conclusions: Vaccination is the most importantmeasure to reduce the risk of feline panleukopenia in shelters. Risk ofparvovirus shedding is especially high in young, group-housed cats.

TI  - SARS CoV-2 (Delta Variant) Infection Kinetics and Immunopathogenesis in Domestic Cats.

LID - 10.3390/v14061207 [doi]
AB  - Continued emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants highlights the critical need foradaptable and translational animal models for acute COVID-19. Limitations tocurrent animal models for SARS CoV-2 (e.g., transgenic mice, non-human primates, ferrets) include subclinical to mild lower respiratory disease, divergence fromclinical COVID-19 disease course, and/or the need for host genetic modifications to permit infection. We therefore established a feline model to study COVID-19disease progression and utilized this model to evaluate infection kinetics andimmunopathology of the rapidly circulating Delta variant (B.1.617.2) ofSARS-CoV-2. In this study, specific-pathogen-free domestic cats (n = 24) wereinoculated intranasally and/or intratracheally with SARS CoV-2 (B.1.617.2).Infected cats developed severe clinical respiratory disease and pulmonary lesionsat 4- and 12-days post-infection (dpi), even at 1/10 the dose of previouslystudied wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Infectious virus was isolated from nasal secretionsof delta-variant infected cats in high amounts at multiple timepoints, and viral antigen was co-localized in ACE2-expressing cells of the lungs (pneumocytes,vascular endothelium, peribronchial glandular epithelium) and strongly associatedwith severe pulmonary inflammation and vasculitis that were more pronounced than in wild-type SARS-CoV-2 infection. RNA sequencing of infected feline lung tissuesidentified upregulation of multiple gene pathways associated with cytokinereceptor interactions, chemokine signaling, and viral protein-cytokineinteractions during acute infection with SARS-CoV-2. Weighted correlation networkanalysis (WGCNA) of differentially expressed genes identified several distinctclusters of dysregulated hub genes that are significantly correlated with bothclinical signs and lesions during acute infection. Collectively, the results ofthese studies help to delineate the role of domestic cats in disease transmissionand response to variant emergence, establish a flexible translational model todevelop strategies to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and identify potentialtargets for downstream therapeutic development.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Companion Animals: Prospective Serological Survey andRisk Factor Analysis in France.

LID - 10.3390/v14061178 [doi]
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible forCOVID-19 in people, has been detected in companion animals on rare occasions. Alimited number of large-scale studies have investigated the exposure of companionanimals to SARS-CoV-2. The objective of this prospective study was to estimateseroprevalence in privately owned dogs and cats presented in veterinary clinicsin different French regions and to test the hypothesis that the occurrence of an episode of COVID-19 in the household and close contact with the owner wouldincrease the chances of the animals being seropositive. One hundred andsixty-five dogs and 143 cats were blood-sampled between March 2020 and December2021. Neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 8.4% of cats (12/143)and 5.4% of dogs (9/165). Seven animals (three dogs and four cats) wereseropositive in the absence of an episode of COVID-19 in the household. Despitenot being statistically significant (chi-square test, p-value = 0.55), our datamay suggest that the occurrence of an episode of COVID-19 in the household could increase the risk of animal seropositivity (odds ratio = 1.38; 95% confidenceinterval = 0.55-3.77). This survey indirectly shows that SARS-CoV-2 circulates incanine and feline populations, but its circulation appears to be too low for petsto act as a significant viral reservoir.

TI  - Secretory Profile of Adipose-Tissue-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells from Cats withCalicivirus-Positive Severe Chronic Gingivostomatitis.
LID - 1146 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14061146 [doi]
AB  - The feline calicivirus (FCV) causes infections in cats all over the world andseems to be related to a broad variety of clinical presentations, such as feline chronic gingivostomatitis (FCGS), a severe oral pathology in cats. Although itsetiopathogeny is largely unknown, FCV infection is likely to be a mainpredisposing factor for developing this pathology. During recent years, newstrategies for treating FCGS have been proposed, based on the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and their regenerative and immunomodulatory properties. The mainmechanism of action of MSC seems to be paracrine, due to the secretion of manybiomolecules with different biological functions (secretome). Currently, several pathologies in humans have been shown to be related to functional alterations of the patient's MSCs. However, the possible roles that altered MSCs might have indifferent diseases, including virus-mediated diseases, remain unknown. We haverecently demonstrated that the exosomes produced by the adipose-tissue-derivedMSCs (fAd-MSCs) from cats suffering from FCV-positive severe and refractory FCGS showed altered protein contents. Based on these findings, the goal of this workwas to analyze the proteomic profile of the secretome produced by felineadipose-tissue-derived MSCs (fAd-MSCs) from FCV-positive patients with FCGS, inorder to identify differences between them and to increase our knowledge of theetiopathogenesis of this disease. We used high-resolution mass spectrometry andfunctional enrichment analysis with Gene Ontology to compare the secretomesproduced by the fAd-MSCs of healthy and calicivirus-positive FCGS cats. We found that the fAd-MSCs from cats with FCGS had an increased expression ofpro-inflammatory cytokines and an altered proteomic profile compared to thesecretome produced by cells from healthy cats. These findings help us gaininsight on the roles of MSCs and their possible relation to FCGS, and may beuseful for selecting specific biomarkers and for identifying new therapeutictargets.

LID - 698 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pathogens11060698 [doi]
AB  - Background: Pets, especially cats and dogs, represent a great potential forzoonotic transmission, leading to major health problems. The purpose of thissystematic review was to present the latest developments concerning colistinresistance through mcr genes in pets. The current study also highlights thehealth risks of the transmission of colistin resistance between pets and humans. Methods: We conducted a systematic review on mcr-positive bacteria in pets andstudies reporting their zoonotic transmission to humans. Bibliographic researchqueries were performed on the following databases: Google Scholar, PubMed,Scopus, Microsoft Academic, and Web of Science. Articles of interest wereselected using the PRISMA guideline principles. Results: The analyzed articlesfrom the investigated databases described the presence of mcr gene variants inpets including mcr-1, mcr-2, mcr-3, mcr-4, mcr-5, mcr-8, mcr-9, and mcr-10. Amongthese articles, four studies reported potential zoonotic transmission of mcrgenes between pets and humans. The epidemiological analysis revealed that dogsand cats can be colonized by mcr genes that are beginning to spread in different countries worldwide. Overall, reported articles on this subject highlight thehigh risk of zoonotic transmission of colistin resistance genes between pets and their owners. Conclusions: This review demonstrated the spread of mcr genes inpets and their transmission to humans, indicating the need for further measuresto control this significant threat to public health. Therefore, we suggest heresome strategies against this threat such as avoiding zoonotic transmission.

LID - 10.3390/pathogens11060675 [doi]
AB  - Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular obligate parasite that causestoxoplasmosis, a zoonotic infection that affects warm-blooded animals and humans worldwide. To comprehensively characterize the disease condition in Pakistan for future reference, we ascertained the prevalence of Toxoplasma infection andpredisposing factors in the Pakistani population over a 20-year period. Wesystematically reviewed research articles published in English (2000-2020) fromPubMed and Google Scholar. The search results 26 publications involving 10,924people and 2611 seropositive cases. The toxoplasmosis seropositivity rate washigher in women (25.44%) as compared to men (21.48%) and were statisticallysignificant (p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, seropositivity was high among peoplewith direct contact with cats, who consumed uncooked meat and raw vegetables, hadpoor education, and lived in rural areas. The 35-65-year age group had thehighest prevalence rate of T. gondii infection. Toxoplasma infection wassignificantly more prevalent in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province (25.87%) than inPunjab (20.42%) (p &lt; 0.001). This is the first comprehensive analysis of T.gondii infection epidemiology in Pakistan. It reveals a high frequency ofinfection among women. We strongly encourage further research to aid patient careand the development of more efficient diagnostic tests and preventativetechniques.

TI  - Detection of Leishmania spp. in Chronic Dermatitis: Retrospective Study inExposed Horse Populations.
LID - 634 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pathogens11060634 [doi]
AB  - Leishmania infantum is a protozoan causing human zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (ZVL) and visceral-cutaneous canine leishmaniosis (CanL) in the MediterraneanBasin. L. infantum is able to infect a large number of wild and domestic species,including cats, dogs, and horses. Since the 1990s, clinical cases of equineleishmaniasis (EL), typically characterized by cutaneous forms, have beenincreasingly diagnosed worldwide. The aim of the present study was to evaluatethe presence of clinical forms of EL in CanL-endemic areas in Italy, whereexposure of equine populations was ascertained from recent serological surveys.For this purpose, formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded skin biopsies of 47 horsespresenting chronic dermatitis compatible with EL were retrospectively selectedfor the study and subjected to conventional and q-PCR. A singular positivity for L. infantum was found; BLAST analysis of sequence amplicons revealed a 99-100%homology with L. infantum sequences. The histological examination revealed anodular lymphoplasmacytic and histiocytic infiltrate; immunohistochemistry showedrare macrophages containing numerous positive amastigotes. The presentretrospective study reports, for the first time, a case of a cutaneous lesion by L. infantum occurring in an Italian horse. Pathological and healthy skin samples should be investigated on a larger scale to provide information on the potential clinical impact of EL in the practice, and to define the role of horses inepidemiological ZVL and CanL scenarios.

TI  - Genetic Determination of the Amount of White Spotting: A Case Study in SiberianCats.
LID - 1006 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13061006 [doi]
AB  - The current hypothesis, along with the opinion of the breeders, is that a catwith two copies of the white spotting allele (SS) has white on more than half of its body, while a cat with only one copy (Ss) has white on less than half of its body. The present study was based on the analysis of two large pedigree databasesof Siberian cats (23,905 individuals in PawPeds and 21,650 individuals in FelisPolonia database). The distribution of the amount of white spotting in theoffspring of cats with different amounts of white was investigated. Significantdifferences compared to expected distributions were observed. In many cases theamount of white in cats that were supposed to be homozygous was less than 50% of the body, while in many supposedly heterozygous cats a very large amount of white(over 50%) was observed. This phenomenon was also presented on the verifiedexamples of the specific families excluding possible errors in determining theamount of white by the breeder. The collected evidence suggests that there areother factors involved in the inheritance of the amount of white in cats and the current hypothesis should be revised.

TI  - Comparative Study of Brain Size Ontogeny: Marsupials and Placental Mammals.
LID - 900 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biology11060900 [doi]
AB  - There exists a negative allometry between vertebrate brain size and body size. Ithas been well studied among placental mammals but less is known regardingmarsupials. Consequently, this study explores brain/body ontogenetic growth inmarsupials and compares it with placental mammals. Pouch young samples of 43koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus), 28 possums (Trichosurus vulpecula), and 36tammar wallabies (Macropus eugenii) preserved in a solution of 10% bufferedformalin, as well as fresh juveniles and adults of 43 koalas and 40 possums, werestudied. Their brain size/body size allometry was compared to that among humans, rhesus monkeys, dogs, cats, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, wild pigs, and mice. Two patterns of allometric curves were found: a logarithmic one (marsupials, rabbits,wild pigs, and guinea pigs) and a logistic one (the rest of mammals).

TI  - Triplet Chemotherapy with Cisplatin versus Oxaliplatin in the CRITICS Trial:Treatment Compliance, Toxicity, Outcomes and Quality of Life in Patients withResectable Gastric Cancer.
LID - 2963 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cancers14122963 [doi]
AB  - (1) Background: Perioperative chemotherapy is the current standard treatment for patients with resectable gastric cancer. Based on studies in patients withmetastatic gastric cancer, oxaliplatin has replaced cisplatin in the curativesetting as well. However, evidence to prefer oxaliplatin over cisplatin in thecurative setting is limited. (2) Methods: We compared patient-related andtumor-related outcomes for cisplatin versus oxaliplatin in patients withresectable gastric cancer treated with perioperative chemotherapy in the CRITICS trial. (3) Results: Preoperatively, 632 patients received cisplatin and 149patients received oxaliplatin. Preoperative severe toxicity was encountered in422 (67%) patients who received cisplatin versus 89 (60%) patients who receivedoxaliplatin (p = 0.105). Severe neuropathy was observed in 5 (1%) versus 6 (4%; p= 0.009) patients, respectively. Postoperative severe toxicity occurred in 109(60%) versus 26 (51%) (p = 0.266) patients; severe neuropathy in 2 (1%) versus 2 (4%; p = 0.209) for patients who received cisplatin or oxaliplatin, respectively.Diarrhea impacted the quality of life more frequently in patients who receivedoxaliplatin compared to cisplatin. Complete or near-complete pathologicalresponse was achieved in 94 (21%) versus 16 (15%; p = 0.126) patients whoreceived cisplatin or oxaliplatin, respectively. Overall survival was notsignificantly different in both groups (p = 0.300). (4) Conclusions: Bothcisplatin and oxaliplatin are legitimate options as part of systemic treatment inpatients with resectable gastric cancer.

LID - 739 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antibiotics11060739 [doi]
AB  - The "One Health" concept increasingly demonstrates the global spread ofpathogenic (also eukaryotic) microorganisms and their zoonotic potential.Dermatophytes can cause superficial mycoses in humans and animals. Furthermore,the number of transmissions from asymptomatic carriers to humans has been on the rise over the last few years. This study was focused on the detailedcharacterisation of clinical isolates of Trichophyton quinckeanum withepidemiological analyses and characterisation of their in vitro antifungalsusceptibility patterns. The isolated dermatophytes were identified with acombination of conventional and molecular methods. In turn, their susceptibility in vitro was tested according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M38 ed.3 protocol. A total of 36 strains were isolated, with 21 cases ofT. quinckeanum zoonoses resulting from direct contact with symptomatic cats(58.3%). The other 15 strains (41.7%) were isolated simultaneously from healthycats and their owners. All strains showed high susceptibility to allylamine,pyridinone, and phenyl morpholine derivatives but were resistant to fluconazoleand ketoconazole. In conclusion, our study shows the frequency of zoonosescontracted from asymptomatic cats. Moreover, the antifungal susceptibilityprofiles indicate the serious risk posed to animal owners by resistant strains ofT. quinckeanum, which are often responsible for recalcitrant-to-treatment cases.

LID - 10.3390/ani12121575 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed at understanding the reasons veterinarians conduct a urinaryprotein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) in cats, correlating it with signalment, dipstickproteinuria tests, and urine specific gravity (USG) and assessing its role inchronic kidney disease (CKD) diagnosis and monitoring. A retrospective study was conducted, including medical data from cats consulted between 2016 and 2018 in a veterinary teaching hospital and submitted to at least one UPCR measurement. Atotal of 140 cats were included: 35% non-proteinuric (UPCR &lt; 0.2), 25%borderline proteinuric (0.2 &lt; UPCR &lt; 0.4), and 40% overtly proteinuric(UPCR &gt; 0.4). In contrast to other studies, there was no association betweenUPCR and male reproductive status. UPCR was mainly requested for CKD diagnosisand monitoring. Correlation between UPCR and combined results from dipstick testsand USG was low and inconsistent. Proteinuric CKD cats had a worse outcome atboth 6 (odds ratio (OR 4.04) and 12 months (OR 4.36)), and this finding was more pronounced for severely proteinuric cases in which the OR for death was 4.36 and 6.00 at 6 and at 12 months, respectively. In addition to reinforcing the negativeprognostic value of proteinuria, this study stresses the low and the inconsistentagreement between UPCR and the combined results of dipstick tests and USG incats.

LID - 10.3390/ani12121572 [doi]
AB  - Chronic rhinitis is a quite common upper respiratory tract (URT) disease in cats.As a result of unclear etiology, frequently, multidrug-resistant bacteria areidentified. This study investigated bacterial isolations and an antimicrobialsusceptibility test (AST) in chronic rhinitis in cats. The medical records of 395cats with chronic URT signs were reviewed at the Kasetsart University Veterinary Teaching Hospital (KUVTH) between 2016 and 2021 to survey the underlying causesof URT. Then, apart from rhinitis, other causes were excluded to identify thebacterial species and antimicrobial susceptibility. The results indicated thatthe most frequent finding was neoplasia, followed by rhinitis and anatomicaldefects. Furthermore, the only significant association was between the age range and disease group, with gender, FIV, or FeLV infection not being significant.Rhinitis was 4.7 times more likely to occur than neoplasia in younger and youngadult cats in the age range &lt; 1-3 years compared to the group &gt; 10 years.The main bacterial species was the Pseudomonas species. Antimicrobials with asusceptibility rate of more than 90% were amikacin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin,norfloxacin, marbofloxacin, imipenem, and meropenem. In conclusion, rhinitis was the second most common chronic URT disease in cats and was more common in youngerand young adult cats. The predominant bacteria with AST in this study reflect theantimicrobial resistance situation. Thus, antimicrobial usage should followantimicrobial use guidelines first.

TI  - Presence of a mouse mammary tumour virus-like in feline lymphomas: a preliminary study.
PG  - 35
LID - 10.1186/s13027-022-00449-9 [doi]
AB  - The mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV) is implicated in the aetiology of murinemammary carcinomas and a variant of it, the type B leukemogenic virus, can cause murine thymic lymphomas. Interestingly, a MMTV-like virus is suspected to beinvolved in human breast cancer and feline mammary carcinomas. However, to date, no cases of MMTV-like sequence amplifications have been described in lymphoidneoplasms in veterinary literature. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of env nucleotide sequences and protein 14 (p14) of a MMTV-like virus infifty-three feline lymphoma samples. Our results show that MMTV-like sequenceswere detected in 5/53 tumours (9.4%): three gastrointestinal lymphomas (oneB-type diffuse large, one B-type small non-cleaved, and one T-type diffuse mixed lymphoma); and two nasal lymphomas (one B-type diffuse small cleaved lymphoma andone B-type diffuse mixed lymphoma). P14 expression was detected in the cytoplasm,and rarely in nuclei, exclusively of neoplastic cells from PCR-positive tumours. The correlation between the presence of the MMTV-env like sequences (MMTVels) andp14 antigen was statistically significant in nasal lymphomas. All cats withMMTVels-positive lymphoma had a history of contact with the outdoor environmentand/or catteries, and two deceased subjects shared their environment with catsthat also died of lymphoma. In conclusion, this study succeeds in demonstratingthe presence of MMTVels and p14 in feline lymphomas. The characterization of the immunophenotype of MMTVels-positive lymphomas could contribute to theunderstanding of a possible role of a MMTV-like virus in feline tumour aetiology.The significant association between the presence of the viral sequences inlymphoid tumours and their nasal localization, together with the data collectedthrough supplementary anamnesis, should be further analysed in order tounderstand the epidemiology of the virus.

TI  - Circulation of heterogeneous Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 in diarrheal cats andprevalence of an A91S feline panleukopenia virus variant in China.
LID - 10.1111/tbed.14641 [doi]
AB  - Cats are susceptible to panleukopenia virus (FPV) and canine parvovirus type 2(CPV-2) infection. FPV has been recognized as relatively conservative in genetic evolution compared to CPV-2, but information regarding FPV variations in cats is still limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular prevalence of FPV and CPV-2 variants among cats in China. From April 2019 to December 2021, 193 diarrheal faecal samples of cats were collected from Southwest China and 127 (65.80%) samples tested positive to Carnivore protoparvovirus 1. FPV, CPV-2 andsome their genomic variants were identified from positive samples, indicating aheterogeneous Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 circulation in the cat population inChina. Among FPV strains, an A91S FPV mutant reached the detection rate of39.37%, which showed that this FPV genomic variant has been prevalent in thetested cats. Moreover, 7 strains of A91S FPV variants were isolated and purified successfully using F81 cells, and the genomes were sequenced. Phylogenetic trees based on the nearly complete genomic sequences, VP2 and NS1 nucleotide sequences showed that the A91S FPV variants were located in the FPV clade, but allclustered into a separate branch. Structural prediction showed that A91S mutationin VP2 protein extended the random coil of aa residues from 92-95 to 91-95.Moreover, the analysis of all complete VP2 sequences of FPV and CPV-2 availablein the GenBank database revealed that the A91S FPV variant has been prevalent in China since 2017 and has reported in four other countries in cats. Thus, ourstudy revealed that heterogeneous Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 are circulating in the cat population in China, and first reported the prevalence and genomiccharacteristics of the A91S FPV variant, which contributed to a betterunderstanding of the molecular prevalence and genetic evolution of FPV in cats.

TI  - Sex, and other important things: Tracking ratios of ecologically significantcategories.
LID - 10.1037/xge0001227 [doi]
AB  - The ratio of males and females in a population (the sex ratio) has beendocumented as an important factor in calibrating mating behaviors. This impliesmental processes of attention, perception, categorization, and memory to obtainthese environmental sex ratios. Although recent work has indicated that sex ratioinformation can be processed quickly, accurately, and with little effort, thereare still open questions about whether sex ratio information is cognitivelyprivileged or prioritized, relative to other environmental information. Thepresent experiments used an ensemble coding paradigm with larger, more complexmatrices of stimuli and with a more feasible range of ratios (between 7:13 to13:7) than many prior studies on sex ratio perception. Experiment 1 found thatsex ratio estimates are sensitive to actual seen ratios (of a 4 x 5 matrix offaces, shown for about 500 ms), and that those judgments are more accurate thansimilarly presented ensemble coding judgments for vehicles (ratios of cars andtruck) or for animals (ratios of cats and dogs). Experiment 2 found that sexratio estimates and hair color ratio estimates are about equal in accuracy. Theseresults together suggest that faces are a privileged content for frequencytracking, relative to other aspects of the environment. Further research canextend this work by disambiguating factors such as complexity anddiscriminability of various facial cues and the stage of processing at whichthose cues are being used.

LID - 10.3390/vetsci9060301 [doi]
AB  - The number of pets such as dogs, cats, rabbits, and parrots has increased inEuropean families. Social benefits to owners such as decreasing feelings ofloneliness and anxiety are provided by pets which are also used inAnimal-assisted Therapy (AAT). Nevertheless, human-animal interactions are alsoassociated with health problems including allergies, asthma, and zoonosis.Rabbits may carry potential pathogens for humans. One of the most common bacteriathat colonizes the oro-pharynx and the upper respiratory tract of rabbits isPasteurella (P.) multocida. Transmission of the infection to humans results from scratches, licks, and bites but it also can occur from the inhalation of airparticles containing the microorganism. Immunocompromised people or persons with pulmonary disorders are particularly susceptible to the infection. Infectedrabbits may carry P. multocida with or without clinical signs. In this paper, thesensitivity to antibiotics and the invasiveness ability of P. multocidaidentified in a farm of pet rabbits affected by severe pasteurellosis wereinvestigated. The strain was P. multocida belonging to capsular type A which isthe type most often detected in humans. The identified strain was susceptible to the tested antibiotics, but it appeared equipped with several virulence geneswhich are responsible for fimbriae production, adhesion processes to host cells, enzyme production, and are involved in iron acquisition processes. These findingsare of particular interest because rabbits recovered from pasteurellosis veryoften become carriers of the bacteria. Therefore, we suggest considering P.multocida screening in the routine medical checks of rabbits, especially if they are meant to be companion animals for children and elder people, given that thetransmission of the pathogen cannot be excluded.

LID - 10.3390/vetsci9060278 [doi]
AB  - Obesity is a nutritional disorder commonly diagnosed in adult cats that has been associated with an increased risk of different chronic diseases includingrespiratory diseases. The main objective of this study is to define if there is arelation between lung function measured by barometric whole-body plethysmography and obesity in cats with bronchoconstriction. Fifty-three cats were included inthe study. All animals presented a bronchoconstriction status diagnosed with anEnhanced Pause (Penh) value higher than the reference range. Based on astandardized 9-point body condition scale, 36 cats were normal-weight cats (with BCS &lt; 6), and 17 cats were considered overweight or obese cats (with BCS >/=6). Overweight cats were mainly male cats and older, and presented lower tidalvolume values, lower minute volume values, and lower peak inspiratory andexpiratory flows than normal-weight cats. According to the results of the presentstudy, overweight cats showed a more compromised lung function parameters relatedto restrictive pattern compared with normal-weight cats. However, overweight catsdid not show a higher bronchoconstriction level compared with normal-weight cats.

TI  - Development of Nested PCR for SARS-CoV-2 Detection and Its Application forDiagnosis of Active Infection in Cats.
LID - 272 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vetsci9060272 [doi]
AB  - SARS-CoV-2 emerged in 2019 and found diagnostic laboratories unpreparedworldwide. To meet the need for timely and accurate virus detection, laboratoriesused rapid Ag tests and PCR kits based on costly multi-channel real-timetechniques. This study aimed to develop a conventional nested PCR based on theSARS-CoV-2 N gene, validate it against some approved assays, and apply it tosamples from six cats with respiratory symptoms obtained in early 2020 during thefirst COVID-19 wave in humans in Bulgaria. The nested PCR technique showed 100%sensitivity and specificity; it could detect extracted SARS-CoV-2 RNA atconcentrations as low as 0.015 ng/muL. The results identified the six tested cat samples as positive. Sequence analysis performed in two of them confirmed this.The presented technique is reliable, easy to implement and inexpensive, and canbe successful in strategies for the prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2 inhumans, cats and other susceptible species.

TI  - Occurrence of Histamine in Commercial Cat Foods under Different StorageConditions.
LID - 270 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vetsci9060270 [doi]
AB  - In fish-based foods, one of the effects of inappropriate storage can be theformation of biogenic amines. Among these, histamine is considered one of themost toxic. The purpose of the present study is to assess the occurrence ofhistamine in fish-based pet foods, and to evaluate the changes in histaminecontent during storage at different temperatures. For the analysis, an LC-MS/MSmethod was used. Fifty-eight pet foods were purchased, and an aliquot of them wasanalyzed just after opening the packages. Histamine was detected in 12 samplesand concentrations ranged from 1.5 to 30.1 mg/kg. The remaining of each positive sample was divided into seven subsamples. One of them was used as a controlsample and kept at -20 degrees C, while the other six were exposed to differentenvironmental conditions. Samples exposed to room temperature showed nosignificant changes in histamine levels, while samples exposed to hightemperatures showed significant increases in histamine content. Finally, samples exposed to refrigerator temperature showed a slight decrease in histamine levels.Under the experimental conditions, the EU limit of 100 mg/kg established forfishery products was never exceeded. These results seem to indicate a low risk ofhistamine intoxication in cats fed fish-based pet food.

LID - 10.3390/vetsci9060265 [doi]
AB  - Nocardiosis, a rare infectious disease in dogs and cats, is caused byGram-positive aerobic actinomycetes of the genus Nocardia. A one-year-oldcastrated male Great Dane was presented with clinical signs of an ulceratednodule on the right ear, which was observed after two weeks of treatment withcyclosporine and prednisolone due to idiopathic hepatitis. Cytologicalexamination revealed pyogranulomatous inflammatory cells and blanched filamentousrods. To detect infectious agents, serosanguinous discharge of the nodule wassubjected to bacterial and fungal cultures. For phenotyping of the infectiousagents, colonies on blood agar culture plates were further analyzed bymatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)-time-of-flight (TOF) massspectrometry (VITEK MS). The MALDI-TOF spectra were identified as N. africana.Thus, the present case was diagnosed as cutaneous nocardiosis. The skin lesionsof ulcerated nodules with fistulous tracts were gradually resolved by theadministration of meropenem (8 mg/kg TID, IV) and doxycycline (5 mg/kg BID, PO). Although complete resolution of the skin lesions was observed on day 91 after theinitial presentation, single administration of doxycycline was continued untilday 198 after the initial presentation to prevent recurrence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of Nocardia africana infection in a dog. Inaddition, our results show that MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis could be auseful tool for the detection of Nocardia. spps.

LID - 253 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vetsci9060253 [doi]
AB  - Benign mammary lesions are infrequent in cats. Among these, the most common isfeline fibroadenomatous change, a hyperplastic/dysplastic change associated with hormonal imbalances. Although never thoroughly described in scientificliterature, feline fibroadenomas, which share some morphological features withfibroadenomatous change, have been variably included in classification systems.The aim of this study was to characterise feline mammary fibroadenomas from ahistological and immunophenotypical point of view in order to allow thestandardisation of classification. Nine cases were retrospectively collected fromeight female and one male cat with no history of hormonal stimulation. Diagnosticinclusion criteria were defined and immunohistochemistry was performed.Histologically, nodules were composed of neoplastic epithelial cells arranged in arborizing lobular-like structures surrounded by abundant proliferating stroma.In all analysed cases, epithelial elements showed immunolabelling forpancytokeratin, cytokeratin19, and beta-catenin. Interestingly, five cases showedmultifocal epithelial vimentin positivity. Epithelial nuclear oestrogen receptor positivity was observed in three of the nine samples. In all cases, myoepithelialcells did not extend into the interstitium. Stromal cells expressed vimentin,calponin, and mild beta-catenin. The median Ki67 scores were 18% and 8.3% in the epithelial and stromal components, respectively. This study describes, for thefirst time, the morphological and immunophenotypical features of feline mammaryfibroadenoma, highlighting its existence as a separate entity fromfibroadenomatous change.

TI  - Beyond Domestic Cats: Environmental Detection of Sporothrix brasiliensis DNA in aHyperendemic Area of Sporotrichosis in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil.
LID - 604 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jof8060604 [doi]
AB  - In Brazil, sporotrichosis has transitioned from a rural to urban disease, driven by a shift in the initiation of infection from the accidental inoculation oforganic matter to the traumatic implantation of the fungus by cats. Since theemergence of zoonotic sporotrichosis caused by Sporothrix brasiliensis,investigations have largely ignored the environmental habitat of the pathogen dueto its association with domestic cats. Therefore, we investigated 18environmental samples collected from rural areas of two cities where zoonoticsporotrichosis is endemic, but where domestic cats are scarce. We utilizedtraditional culture methods, and samples were also examined with two molecularmethods used for the clinical diagnosis of sporotrichosis: a nested-PCR targetingthe ITS region and a species-specific PCR targeting the calmodulin gene. NoSporothrix colonies were identified by traditional culture methods. However, the nested-PCR and the species-specific PCR for S. brasiliensis were positive for 18 and 5 samples, respectively. Sequencing revealed that positive results with thenested-PCR were due to non-specific amplification of other Ophiostomatales DNA,rather than Sporothrix spp. Three of the five amplicons from the species-specificPCR were suitable for sequencing and confirmed the presence of S. brasiliensisDNA. Hence, we confirmed that S. brasiliensis, as with other Sporothrix species, has an environmental habitat. Our findings underscore the challenges ofnested-PCR for Sporothrix environmental studies and highlight that sequencingmust follow PCR protocols to definitively identify Sporothrix spp. inenvironmental samples.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of maropitant citrate in Rhode Island Red chickens (Gallusgallus domesticus) following subcutaneous administration.
LID - 10.1111/jvp.13082 [doi]
AB  - Maropitant citrate is a synthetic neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist and substance P inhibitor used for control of emesis in dogs in cats. Maropitant citrate isused empirically in birds, despite a lack of pharmacokinetic data in avianspecies. The objective of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetic profileof a single dose of maropitant citrate 1 and 2 mg/kg subcutaneously (SC) in eightRhode Island Red hens (Gallus gallus domesticus). A crossover study design wasused with 1-week washout between trials. Blood samples were collected over 36 hafter drug administration. Plasma concentrations were measured using liquidchromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and pharmacokinetic parameters weredetermined via non-compartmental analysis. The mean maximum plasma concentration,time to maximum concentration, and elimination half-life following 1 and 2 mg/kg SC were 915.6 +/- 312.8 ng/ml and 1195.2 +/- 320.2 ng/ml, 0.49 +/- 0.21 h and 1.6+/- 2.6 h, and 8.47 +/- 2.24 h and 8.58 +/- 2.6 h, respectively. Pharmacokinetic data suggests doses of 1 or 2 mg/kg SC may be administered every 12-24 h tomaintain above target plasma concentration similar to dogs (90 ng/ml). These dataprovide a basis for further investigation of maropitant citrate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in birds.

TI  - New Avenues to Design Toxoplasma Vaccines Based on Oocysts and Cysts.
PG  - 910961
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.910961 [doi]
AB  - Toxoplasmosis is a worldwide disease affecting all warm-blooded animals,including humans. Vaccination strategies aimed at inducing an efficient immuneresponse while preventing transmission have been attempted in the past. Whilemany different approaches can partially protect immunized animals againstsubsequent infections, full and lasting protection is rarely attained and onlywith live-attenuated vaccines. In addition, vaccines based on mutant strains thatare deficient in forming the chronic phase of the parasite (such as Toxovax)cannot be extensively used due to their zoonotic potential and the possibility ofreversion to virulent phenotypes. An increasing number of studies using emerging genetic-engineering tools have been conducted to design novel vaccines based onrecombinant proteins, DNA or delivery systems such as nanoparticles. However,these are usually less efficient due to their antigenic simplicity. In thisperspective article we discuss potential target genes and novel strategies togenerate live-attenuated long-lasting vaccines based on tissue cysts and oocysts,which are the environmentally resistant chronic forms of Toxoplasma. Byselectively disrupting genes important for parasite dissemination, cyst formationand/or sporozoite invasion, alone or in combination, a vaccine based on alive-attenuated strain that elicits a protective immune response while preventingthe transmission of Toxoplasma could be created. Finally, further improvements ofprotocols to generate Toxoplasma sexual stages in vitro might lead to theproduction of oocysts from such a strain without the need for using mice or cats.

TI  - The Omicron variant BA.1.1 presents a lower pathogenicity than B.1 D614G andDelta variants in a feline model of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - Omicron (B.1.1.529) is the most recent SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC), whichemerged in late 2021 and rapidly achieved global predominance in early 2022. Inthis study, we compared the infection dynamics, tissue tropism and pathogenesisand pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 D614G (B.1), Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron BA.1.1sublineage (B.1.1.529) variants in a highly susceptible feline model ofinfection. While D614G- and Delta-inoculated cats became lethargic, and showedincreased body temperatures between days 1 and 3 post-infection (pi),Omicron-inoculated cats remained subclinical and, similar to control animals,gained weight throughout the 14-day experimental period. Intranasal inoculationof cats with D614G- and the Delta variants resulted in high infectious virusshedding in nasal secretions (up to 6.3 log10 TCID 50 .ml (-1) ), whereasstrikingly lower level of viruses shedding (<3.1 log10 TCID 50 .ml (-1) ) wasobserved in Omicron-inoculated animals. In addition, tissue distribution of theOmicron variant was markedly reduced in comparison to the D614G and Deltavariants, as evidenced by in situ viral RNA detection, in situimmunofluorescence, and quantification of viral loads in tissues on days 3, 5,and 14 pi. Nasal turbinate, trachea, and lung were the main - but not the only - sites of replication for all three viral variants. However, only scarce virusstaining and lower viral titers suggest lower levels of viral replication intissues from Omicron-infected animals. Notably, while D614G- and Delta-inoculatedcats had severe pneumonia, histologic examination of the lungs fromOmicron-infected cats revealed mild to modest inflammation. Together, theseresults demonstrate that the Omicron variant BA.1.1 is less pathogenic than D614Gand Delta variants in a highly susceptible feline model. Author Summary: TheSARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant of concern (VOC) emerged in South Africalate in 2021 and rapidly spread across the world causing a significant increasein the number of infections. Importantly, this variant was also associated withan increased risk of reinfections. However, the number of hospitalizations anddeaths due to COVID-19 did not follow the same trends. These early observations, suggested effective protection conferred by immunizations and/or overall lowervirulence of the highly mutated variant virus. In this study we present novelevidence demonstrating that the Omicron BA.1.1 variant of concern (VOC) presents a lower pathogenicity when compared to D614G- or Delta variants in cats.Clinical, virological and pathological evaluations revealed lower diseaseseverity, viral replication and lung pathology in Omicron-infected cats whencompared to D614G and Delta variant inoculated animals, confirming that OmicronBA.1.1 is less pathogenic in a highly susceptible feline model of infection.

TI  - Current global status, subtype distribution and zoonotic significance ofBlastocystis in dogs and cats: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 225
LID - 10.1186/s13071-022-05351-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Blastocystis is a common intestinal protozoa found in animal andhuman fecal samples, with over 1 billion individuals infected worldwide. Sincedomestication, dogs and cats have had a close bond with humans. However, theirclose proximity poses a potential health risk since they may harbor severalzoonotic agents. A global estimate of Blastocystis infection and subtype (ST)distribution in dogs and cats would therefore be of great health importance tohumans. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive systematic search of fourEnglish-language databases (PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science) forrelevant articles up to 8 November 2021. The random-effects model was used tomake pooled estimates with confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: In total, weidentified 49 publications that met our inclusion criteria and subsequentlyanalyzed the 65 datasets in these articles, of which 23 and 42 datasets were oncats and dogs, respectively. Among the 2934 cats included in the 23 datasets,which involved 16 countries, the prevalence rate of Blastocystis infection was9.3% (95% CI 5.3-15.9%). The prevalence of Blastocystis infection was slightlylower [7%, 95% CI 4.7-10.4%) among the 7946 dogs included in the 42 datasets,involving 23 countries. The sensitivity analysis showed that no remarkablevariation in the estimates upon the stepwise removal of each dataset. Higher STdiversity was found among the examined dogs (ST1-8, ST10, ST23, ST24) than among cats (ST1-4, ST10, ST14). Among dogs, ST3 was the most frequent ST (41.3%),followed by ST2 (39.3%), ST1 (30.9%), ST4 (13.4%), ST8 (12.7%), ST10 (11%) andST5 (8.1%). Also among dogs, each of ST6, ST7, ST23 and ST24 was observed in onlyone study. Of the ST found in the cats examined, ST4 (29.5%), followed by ST10(22.5%), ST1 (19.8%) and ST3 (17.6%) were the most common. A single study alsoreported the presence of both ST2 and ST14 in cats. With respect to zoonoticBlastocystis STs (ST1-ST9 and ST12), eight were reported from dogs (ST1-ST8) and four were isolated from cats (ST1-ST4), showing the implication of dog and catsin zoonotic transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results show thatelucidation of the true epidemiology and ST distribution of Blastocystis in dogs and cats demands more comprehensive studies, particularly in the negelectedregions of the world.

AB  - To explore the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) andspecific receptor tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB) in the primary visual cortex of young and old cats, especially to reveal the age-related differences in themediating mechanism of BDNF-TrkB signaling pathway in cats' visual cortex andtheir possible effects on synaptic plasticity, Nissl staining was used to displayneurons in each layer of cats' primary visual cortex, and immunohistochemical ABCmethod was used to label BDNF and TrkB immunopositive cells in each layer ofcats' primary visual cortex. The BDNF and TrkB receptor immunoreactive neuronsand non-neurons were observed and photographed. Their density and immunoreactive intensity were measured. Results showed that BDNF and TrkB were widely expressed in all layers of visual cortex in young and old cats. Compared with the younggroup, the density and intensity of BDNF and TrkB positive cells in each layer ofprimary visual cortex in the old group decreased significantly (P < 0.01). Thefindings indicate that the expression levels of BDNF and TrkB in the primaryvisual cortex of cats decrease with age, suggesting that the change of BDNF-TrkB signal pathway caused by the weakening of brain-derived neurotrophic factoractivity may be one of the important reasons for the decline of visual function.

LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0467-22.2022 [doi]
AB  - We tested the hypothesis that the pallidum contributes to the control of bothposture and movement. We recorded neuronal activity from the pallidum in a taskin which male cats reached forward from a standing posture to depress a lever. Inagreement with previous studies, we found that a majority of pallidal cells(91/116 78%), including neurons in both the entopeduncular nucleus and the globuspallidus, showed significant modulations of their activity during reaching withthe contralateral limb. Mostly different populations of cells were active during the transport (flexion) and lever press (extension) phase of the task. Most cellsshowed dynamic patterns of activity related to the movement. However, a modestproportion of modulated cells (18/91, 20%) showed properties consistent with acontribution to the control of anticipatory postural responses while a further10% showed activity consistent with a contribution to postural support during themovement. While some cells that showed modified activity only during reaches withthe contralateral forelimb, many cells (65/91, 71%) were also activated duringreaches with the ipsilateral forelimb. This was particularly true for cellsrelated to the lever press, many of which discharged similarly during reaches of either limb. This suggests a context-dependent control of movement and posture inwhich the same muscles are used for different functions during contralateral and ipsilateral reach. Comparison with the results from recordings made previouslyfrom the motor cortex and the pontomedullary reticular formation in the same taskshow more similarities with the former than the latter. Significance statement:Pathological changes in basal ganglia function frequently lead to problems withpostural stability and gait initiation. Here we show that some neurons in one of the output regions of the basal ganglia, the pallidum, show discharge activitycompatible with a contribution to postural control. At the same time, we notethat such cells are a minority in this region with most cells being related tomovement, rather than posture. We also show that many neurons are active duringmovements of both the contralateral and ipsilateral limbs, sometimes withidentical discharge patterns. We suggest that this indicates a context-dependent regulation of movement and posture in the pallidum.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Human cowpox virus infection is a rare zoonotic disease. Cowpox virusis a member of the Orthopoxvirus genus, like smallpox. Over the last yearsrecords of cowpox virus transmission from pet cats and pet rats to humans inEurope have increased. This observation may result from the loss ofcross-immunity against orthopoxviruses after discontinuation of routine smallpox vaccination in the 1980s. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the first case of a human cowpox infection in an unvaccinated Belgian citizen. This 19-year-old studentpresented with multiple necrotic skin lesions on the chin, the scalp and thepubic region, and with cervical lymphadenopathy and flu-like symptoms. Thediagnosis of human cowpox was based on electron microscopic findings and PCRexamination performed on a skin biopsy of the pubic lesion. Close contact withcats (her domestic cats or cats from a local shelter) was probably the source of transmission. Spreading of the lesions was likely the result of autoinoculation. After six months all lesions spontaneously healed with atrophic scars.DISCUSSION: To enhance awareness of this rare viral zoonosis and to verify thesuspected increase in incidence and symptom severity after cessation of smallpox vaccination, one could argue whether human cowpox should become a notifiabledisease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the validity and reliability of theTurkish version of Client Attachment to Therapist Scale (CATSTR) which provides aframework for measuring and conceptualizing the relationship between thetherapist and the client. METHOD: The study included 191 individuals with a mean age of 24.41 years who had received a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 15 sessionsof therapy for different psychological problems. All participants completed theCATS-TR, the Early Close Relationships-R (ECR-R), the Bell Object RelationsInventory (BORRTI), and the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI-SF), and a ClientInformation Form handed to the clients in a closed envelope by their respectivetherapists. RESULTS: Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis resultsindicated an acceptable fit for the CATS-TR which comprised the Secure,Fearful/Avoidant and Preoccupied/Merger subscales, with internal consistencylevels ranging between 0.71 and 0.85. Criterion validity analyses showed that thescores on the CATS-TR Fearful/Avoidant and Preoccupied/Merger subscalescorrelated with the scores on the ECR-R Avoidance/Anxiety subdimesnions and theBORRTI Object Relations subdimension in the expected directions. Also, the meanscore on the CATS-TR Secure Attachment subscale was a significant predictor ofthe therapeutic alliance assessed by the WAI-SF and its subscales. CONCLUSION:This study has demonstrated that the CATS-TR has an acceptable level of validity and reliability with results indicating its usefulness for research and clinical settings in Turkey investigating the common factors bringing about change inpsychotherapy.

AB  - In the current study, we investigated the cortical response of the somatosensory cortex following thermal stimuli to dental implants. Five implants were inserted at the site of the left upper canine with immediate implant placement protocolsin five cats. Intrinsic signal optical imaging was applied to measure thecortical responses evoked by thermal sensing via dental implants. The corticalresponse evoked by 60 g of tactile stimulus to implants was also examined. Theresponse strength and activated location were compared between implants andnatural teeth. Thermal stimuli via the implant could evoke reliable corticalresponses in the tooth-related region. However, the response amplitude evoked by the cold stimuli applied to the implants was significantly lower than that evokedby the cold stimuli applied to the natural teeth, indicating that the implantswere less sensitive to thermal change than the natural tooth. The response evokedby tactile stimuli to implants was significantly stronger than that evoked bycold stimuli. Thermal and tactile stimuli activated the same location of thetooth-related somatosensory cortex in both the implants and natural teeth.Therefore, the thermal change in implants could be detected at the corticalresponse level. Multimodal sensory integration of thermal and tactile functionsexisted for implants.

AB  - VEGF was initially discovered due to its angiogenic activity and therefore named "vascular endothelial growth factor." However, its more recently discoveredneurotrophic activity may be evolutionarily more ancient. Our previous workshowed that all the changes produced by axotomy on the firing activity andsynaptic inputs of abducens motoneurons were completely restored after VEGFadministration. Therefore, we hypothesized that the lack of VEGF delivered byretrograde transport from the periphery should also affect the physiology ofotherwise intact abducens motoneurons. For VEGF retrograde blockade, wechronically applied a neutralizing VEGF antibody to the lateral rectus muscle.Recordings of extracellular single-unit activity and eye movements were made inalert cats before and after the application of the neutralizing antibody. Ourdata revealed that intact, noninjured abducens motoneurons retrogradely deprived of VEGF exhibited noticeable changes in their firing pattern. There is a general decrease in firing rate and a significant reduction in eye position and eyevelocity sensitivity (i.e., a decrease in the tonic and phasic components oftheir discharge, respectively). Moreover, by means of confocalimmunocytochemistry, motoneurons under VEGF blockade showed a marked reduction inthe density of afferent synaptic terminals contacting with their cell bodies.Altogether, the present findings demonstrate that the lack of retrogradelydelivered VEGF renders abducens motoneurons into an axotomy-like state. Thisindicates that VEGF is an essential retrograde factor for motoneuronal synapticdrive and discharge activity.

AB  - The public health implications of zoonotic vector-borne pathogens are numerousbecause domestic animals, such as dogs, live in close proximity to humans. Blood was collected from 116 domestic dogs in Cairo, Egypt from three differentsettings at the human-animal interface. The three settings the dogs came fromwere: privately owned animals seeking care at the Cairo University Faculty ofVeterinary Medicine Clinic, non-laboratory reared research dogs maintained at theCairo University Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, and an urban private animalrescue in Shabramont, Giza, Egypt. Enrolled animals were visually inspected forpresence of flea or tick ectoparasites, Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato tickswere recovered from 56 enrolled animals and a flea identified as Ctenocephalides felis was recovered from one animal. To test for past and/or current infectionwith vector-borne pathogens, conventional PCR and IDEXX SNAP(R) 4Dx(R) Plus were performed on whole blood. Pathogen targets included: Anaplasma spp., Ehrlichiaspp., Babesia spp., Borrelia spp., Bartonella spp., Dirofilaria spp., andRickettsia spp. Among dogs sampled across all locations, one dog was positive forBabesia sp. infection and one dog was positive for Anaplasma sp. infection asdetected by PCR and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Three additional dogs werepositive for infection but had incomplete sequences obtained: two for Ehrlichiasp. and one for Borrelia sp. The SNAP(R) test results for all sampled dogsincluded: eight dogs positive for Anaplasma spp., 14 dogs positive for Ehrlichia spp., and five additional dogs positive for both Anaplasma spp. and Ehrlichiaspp. SNAP(R) test results by sampling location showed that 66% of the dogs at theanimal rescue were positive for Anaplasma spp. and/or Ehrlichia spp., 17% of the privately owned dogs at the Faculty of Veterinary medicine were positive forAnaplasma spp. and/or Ehrlichia spp., and none of the research dogs were positivefor any of the targets on the SNAP(R) test. This high proportion ofseropositivity in the animals sampled indicates a vector population which is not well controlled and a need for continued owner education and promotion ofconsistent use of preventive medications and the risk for zoonotic transmission.

AB  - The cat flea (Ctenocephalides felis) is a competent vector of numerous bacterial pathogens in the genera Bartonella and Rickettsia. In the United States,free-roaming domestic cats (Felis catus) increase the risk of exposure to C.felis for humans and their companion animals. In collaboration with atrap-neuter-return program, we collected fleas from 283 feral/stray cats insoutheastern Georgia between May and July of 2020. A total of 3,643 fleaspecimens were collected, and C. felis was the only flea species recovered fromall cats sampled. The mean number of fleas per cat host was highest in the month of June when compared to May and July, and higher in juvenile cats (< 1 year)than the adults (>/= 1 year). Real-time PCR assays were used to test a subset of the collected fleas (n = 468) for the presence of Bartonella spp. and Rickettsia spp. DNA. Among those flea pools tested, 35.2% were positive for genus-specificcitrate synthase gene of Bartonella, 16.5% were positive for the genus-specific17-kDa protein antigen gene of Rickettsia, and none were positive for thespecies-specific outer membrane protein B gene of Rickettsia typhi. Theidentification of potential flea-borne pathogens was more frequent from thesubset of C. felis collected in May, and female cats had more Bartonella-positivefleas and less Rickettsia-positive fleas than male cats. Overall, the presentstudy provides valuable insights into the frequency of C. felis from outdoorcommunity cats in southeastern Georgia, and highlights the possible risk forhuman exposure to potential flea-borne pathogens.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to analyze the behavioral characteristicsand success of adoption for previously hoarded cats. METHODS: Shelter records andpost-adoption surveys were analyzed for hoarded cats 6 months old at intake. Anon-standard scoring system was used. Intake scores were allocatedcontemporaneously and socialization scores were applied retrospectively for threetime points (TPs): 5-10 days post-intake (shelter TP), 1 week post-adoption (homeTP1) and >1 week post-adoption (home TP2). Adoption returns were compared betweenhoarded and non-hoarded cats. RESULTS: The study included 195 hoarded cats, ofwhich 174 were adopted. Of 164 cats with intake scores, 86 (52%) were scored as'friendly' at intake. Forty-five cats had socialization scores for all of theTPs, and of these, the percentages of 'supersocial' or 'social' decreased from87% at the shelter TP to 47% at home TP1, then increased to 84% at home TP2. Mostcats that scored as 'tense' at intake had supersocial or social scores at homeTP2. Nine of the 88 cats with survey results had out-of-box (OOB) elimination in either the shelter or home but only 1/88 in both. Adopters expressed positivefeelings for 42/43 cats for which feelings-based language was used in theirsurvey responses. Notable behaviors, such as neediness, were recorded for 48/88cats. Relationships with other household pets were typically positive. Eighteenof 174 hoarded (10%) and 188/2662 non-hoarded (7.1%) cats were returnedpost-adoption. Of these, six hoarded and 87 non-hoarded returns includedbehavioral reasons. There were no significant differences between hoarded andnon-hoarded cats for total or behavioral returns. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:Hoarded cats had high adoption rates, high adopter satisfaction and the potentialfor good emotional well-being in adoptive homes. Behavior at intake and OOBelimination in the shelter may not reflect post-adoption behavior. Behavior-basedoutcome decisions for these vulnerable animals should be deferred to allow timefor habituation.

LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.908679 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To determine whether patterns of trauma changed following the start oflocal lockdowns due to COVID-19. Design: Multi-institutional retrospective study assessing patients presenting within 2 years prior to local lockdown due toCOVID-19 and 1 year following lockdown inclusive. Setting: Two universityteaching hospitals and one private referral center in Australia. Animals: Dogsand cats with a presenting complaint of known or suspected trauma. Interventions:Patient signalment, date of presentation, trauma type, treatment interventionsand patient outcome (survival to discharge, cardiopulmonary arrest, oreuthanasia) were recorded in a web-based data capture system (REDCap).Measurements and Main Results: Three thousand one hundred eighty-nine patients(682 cats and 2,507 dogs) were included in the study. Overall trauma prevalencewas 2.9% with pre-lockdown prevalence of 2.8% and post-lockdown prevalence of3.1% (p < 0.001). Cats had higher rates of blunt trauma while penetrating trauma was more prevalent in dogs (p < 0.001). Juvenile patients were also more likelyto have blunt trauma when compared to adult patients (p < 0.001). Patient age andsex characteristics did not differ when comparing the 2 time periods. Compared topre-lockdown, blunt and penetrating trauma patterns changed post-lockdown in dogsand cats (p < 0.001 for both). Interventions were performed more frequently (p = 0.039) in the post-lockdown with surgical procedures having a significantincrease (p = 0.015). Survival rates increased post-lockdown for both species (p < 0.001) with financially driven euthanasia being less common than inpre-lockdown for dogs (p = 0.02). Conclusions: Trauma patterns changed for catsand dogs in the post-lockdown period. Compared to pre-lockdown, trauma prevalencewas higher with a decrease in mortality rate. No increase in juvenile patientswas identified post-lockdown. A decrease in financially driven euthanasia and an increase in interventions suggest no negative financial effect from COVID-19lockdown on trauma patient care in Australia.

PG  - 881232
LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.881232 [doi]
AB  - Prostatic diseases are very common in male dogs, accounting for 3-10% of casessubmitted to the veterinary practitioners. Commonly reported canine prostaticdisorders include prostatic hyperplasia, prostatitis, prostatic cysts andprostatic carcinoma. However, clinical signs may be non-specific, or many casesare asymptomatic, thus leading to a difficult estimation of the actual prevalenceof clinical cases. On the other side, because of the rare occurrence of prostate disease in cats, very little is known about pathogenesis, diagnostic approachesand treatment. The goal of this review is to provide detailed clinical andpathological overview of the feline and canine prostatic pathology, including themost up-to-date classification systems and histological findings. Emphasis isplaces on gross, cytological and histological features that are critical to reacha definitive diagnosis for a proper treatment and prognosis.

AB  - This article describes two cases of notoedric mange concurrent withaelurostrongylidosis in two domestic-owned cats from a rural environment inRomania. Two European shorthair cats originating from the same litter werereferred to our clinic, at 2 months apart, with a history of skin lesions,pruritus, weight loss, and respiratory signs. Cats lived mainly outdoor together with the queen and a third littermate. The latter two expressed the same clinicalsigns and had died before the presentation of the first cat. None of the fourcats was vaccinated, dewormed, or treated for external parasites. Coat brushing, skin scrapings, skin cytology, earwax direct microscopic examination, andcoproparasitological techniques (flotation and Baermann methods) were used aslaboratory procedures. A blood sample was also collected for hematology, bloodbiochemistry, and feline immunodeficiency virus/feline leukemia virus (FIV/FeLV) test. Notoedres cati mites in high numbers were identified by all complementarytests, alongside fleas and Aelurostrongylus abstrusus first-stage larvae. Theblood analysis revealed neutrophilia, and the FIV/FeLV fast test was negative.The cats were successfully treated off-label with selamectin spot-on formulation (Stronghold((R)), Zoetis) three times at 1- or 4-week intervals. Furthermore,they were treated with amoxicillin trihydrate/clavulanic acid, housed indoor, andfed with a commercial diet. Before presentation to the clinic, the female cat wasunsuccessfully treated with a combination of fipronil, S-methoprene,eprinomectin, and praziquantel. During this period, the female cat remainedoutdoor and fed with home wastes. The cats become negative for A. abstrusus L1larvae after 2-4 months of treatment. The owners developed pruritic skin lesions 1 month after introducing the first cat in the house. In conclusion, notoedricmange and aelurostrongylidosis can be treated successfully with selamectin as aspot-on formulation and the treatment must be continued until no parasite will bedetected through specific techniques. The success of treatment depends onimproving the quality of animal life (nutrition and hygiene) and treatment ofsecondary complications.

AB  - The high frequency of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2(SARS-CoV-2) mutations and homology of the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2)cell receptors in various hosts help the virus transcend species barriers. Inthis study, we investigated the mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteindetected in cats and their effect on its structure and function. Interestingly,some of these mutations are reported here in cats for the first time. Structural analysis showed seven residue substitutions in the spike glycoprotein. Four ofthe detected mutations are located on the spike surface, which are criticalinteraction points for neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, three of thereported mutations could facilitate viral binding to the ACE2 host receptor,influence S1/S2 cleavage, destabilize the beta-hairpin structure of the S2 andenhance viral infectivity. Structural modeling and phylogenic analysis of theACE2 receptor provided an indication of the binding capacity of the virus to the specific cell receptors of different species and hosts. The presented workhighlights the effects of the residue substitutions on viral evasion, infectivityand possibility of SARS-CoV-2 spillover between humans and cats. In addition, thework paves the way for in-depth molecular investigation into the relationshipbetween SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding and host susceptibility.

TI  - A frameshift variant in the EXT1 gene in a feline leukemia virus-negative catwith osteochondromatosis.
LID - 10.1111/age.13232 [doi]
AB  - Osteochondromatosis is a benign proliferative disorder characterized bycartilage-capped bony protuberances. In humans and most mammals, variants in the EXT1 or EXT2 gene are strongly correlated with the etiology ofosteochondromatosis. However, in cats, osteochondromatosis has only beenassociated with feline leukemia virus infection. In this study, to explore other factors involved in the etiology of feline osteochondromatosis, we examined theEXT1 and EXT2 genes in a feline leukemia virus-negative cat withosteochondromatosis. Genetic analysis revealed a heterozygous single base pairduplication in exon 6 of the EXT1 gene (XM_023248762.2:c.1468dupC), leading to a premature stop codon in the EXT1 protein. Notably, this frameshift variant isrecognized as one of the most common pathogenic variants in humanosteochondromatosis. Our data suggest for the first time that genetic variantscan have etiologic roles in osteochondromatosis in cats, as in humans and otheranimals.

TI  - The association between symmetric dimethylarginine concentrations and variousneoplasms in dogs and cats.
LID - 10.1111/vco.12845 [doi]
AB  - Following the introduction of the symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) immunoassay, cases were reported where the SDMA concentration was markedly increased above thereference interval (RI) with neither concurrent increases in serum creatinine(Cr) concentrations nor clinical signs of kidney disease. Many of these animalswere also concurrently diagnosed with cancer, most commonly lymphoma. The purposeof the study was to evaluate the association of increased SDMA in dogs and catswith lymphoma and other cancers as compared with age- and breed-matchednon-tumour controls. In this retrospective case-control study, serum chemistryresults from 1804 tumour cases, and age- and breed-matched non-tumour controlanimals were used. Matched-pair odds ratios between animals diagnosed withneoplasms and non-tumour controls for dichotomized SDMA values were determined bytumour type. SDMA concentrations were significantly higher in dogs and cats with lymphoma (p < .0001) compared with non-tumour controls. The odds ratio forincreased SDMA concentrations in dogs with lymphoma was 10.0 (95% CI, 5.98-16.72)and for cats with lymphoma was 3.04 (95% CI 1.95-4.73). A significant number ofcanine and feline lymphoma cases had an increased SDMA concentration notassociated with an increased Cr concentration (p < .001). Canine and felinelymphoma patients have an increased odds of having a SDMA concentration above theRI at diagnosis. Further characterization and evaluation of dogs and cats withlymphoma is required to help understand the mechanism(s) and the clinicalsignificance of these alterations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of an ultrasound (US)-guided quadratuslumborum (QL)-psoas muscle (Pm) interfascial plane injection using a dorsoventral(DV) approach, and to compare needle visualization and distribution patternbetween DV and ventrodorsal (VD) approaches. STUDY DESIGN: Experimentalanatomical study. ANIMALS: A total of 14 cat cadavers. METHODS: Bilateralin-plane US-guided injections in the QL-Pm plane were performed at the level ofthe second lumbar (L2) transverse process. A spinal needle was inserted usingeither a VD or DV approach. A total volume of 0.4 mL kg(-1) of a solution ofropivacaine 0.18%, tissue dye and iohexol (350 mg mL(-1)), in a proportion of3:1:1, respectively, was injected bilaterally. Spread of injectate was comparedand evaluated using US, computed tomography (CT) scanning and anatomicaldissection. Presence of dye on the sympathetic trunk was compared between methodsusing Kappa (kappa) coefficient of agreement. RESULTS: The QL-Pm plane wasvisualized, and dye was present in the target plane using both approaches. Needlevisualization in the VD approach was enhanced compared with the DV approach (p = 0.0005). Mean distribution along the sympathetic trunk was 4.8 and 4.1 segmentsin the VD and DV approaches, respectively, showing non-statistical differences.The ventral branches of L1, L2 and L3 were successfully stained in 11/14 and 6/14using the VD and DV approaches, respectively. Substantial agreement (kappa =0.61) of sympathetic trunk staining was observed between CT scan and anatomicaldissection. Dye was observed cranial to the diaphragm in 7/8 cases on CT withboth approaches. Epidural and abdominal cavity dye distribution was not observed.CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The DV approach to the QL-Pm plane could bean alternative to the VD approach. Both approaches seem capable of reaching thespinal nerves, the sympathetic trunk and both splanchnic and coeliac nerves infeline cadavers.

TI  - Molecular detection of vector-borne agents in wild boars (Sus scrofa) andassociated ticks from Brazil, with evidence of putative new genotypes ofEhrlichia, Anaplasma, and haemoplasmas.
LID - 10.1111/tbed.14632 [doi]
AB  - The present study aimed to investigate, by molecular techniques, the occurrenceof Anaplasmataceae, Bartonellaceae, Rickettsiaceae, Mycoplasmataceae,Coxiellaceae, and Babesiidae/Theileriidae agents in blood samples of free-living wild boars (Sus scrofa) and associated ticks in south-eastern Brazil. For thispurpose, 67 blood samples and 265 ticks (264 Amblyomma sculptum and one Amblyommaovale) were analysed. In the screening for Anaplasmataceae agents by a PCR assay based on the 16S rRNA gene, 5.97% blood samples and 50.54% ticks were positive.In the PCR assay for Ehrlichia spp. based on the dsb gene, 9.24% of ticks werepositive. Despite the low occurrence, a possible new 16S rRNA genotype ofAnaplasma sp. was detected in a wild boar's blood sample. According tophylogenetic analyses based on the 16S rRNA, gltA, and sodB genes and ITS (23S-5SrRNA) intergenic region, it was found that A. sculptum and A. ovale tickscollected from wild boars carry Ehrlichia genotypes phylogenetically associatedwith Ehrlichia ewingii, Ehrlichia ruminantium, and new Ehrlichia genotypespreviously detected in horses, peccaries, and ticks collected from jaguars. Inthe screening for haemoplasmas by a qPCR based on the 16S rRNA gene, 88.06% ofblood samples and 8.69% of ticks were positive. Mycoplasma suis, Mycoplasmaparvum, and a possible new haemoplasma genotype were detected in wild boars insouth-eastern Brazil. In the screening for Bartonella spp. using a nuoG-basedqPCR assay, 3.8% of tick samples were positive. Phylogenetic inferencespositioned four nuoG and one r gltA Bartonella sequences into the same clade asBartonella machadoae. No blood or tick samples from wild boars showed to bepositive in the qPCR for Coxiella burnetii based on the IS1111 gene. On the otherhand, only 1.6% of ticks were positive in the nested PCR assay for piroplasmidsbased on the 18S rRNA gene. A 18S rRNA sequence detected in a pool of A. sculptumnymphs was phylogenetically close to Cytauxzoon felis sequences previouslydetected in cats from the United States. Rickettsia sp. closely related toRickettsia bellii was detected in a pool of A. sculptum nymphs. This is the firstreport of haemoplasmas, B. machadoae, and Cytauxzoon spp. in A. sculptum. Wildboars and associated ticks do not seem to participate in the epidemiologicalcycle of C. burnetii in the region studied. This invasive mammal species may act as a potential disperser of ticks infected with Ehrlichia spp., Bartonella spp., haemotropic mycoplasmas, and Cytauxzoon, and may bring important epidemiological implications in the transmission of bartonelosis, ehrlichiosis, haemoplasmosis,and cytauxzoonosis to humans and animals, more specifically to horses, rodents,pigs, and cats.

AB  - Knowledge of host associations of blood-feeding vectors may afford insights into managing disease systems and protecting public health. However, the ability ofmethods to distinguish bloodmeal sources varies widely. We used twomethods-Sanger sequencing and amplicon deep sequencing-to target a 228 bp region of the vertebrate Cytochrome b gene and determine hosts fed upon by triatomines(n = 115) collected primarily in Texas, USA. Direct Sanger sequencing of PCRamplicons was successful for 36 samples (31%). Sanger sequencing revealed 15distinct host species, which included humans, domestic animals (Canis lupusfamiliaris, Ovis aries, Gallus gallus, Bos taurus, Felis catus, and Caprahircus), wildlife (Rattus rattus, Incilius nebulifer, Sciurus carolinensis,Sciurus niger, and Odocoileus virginianus), and captive animals (Panthera tigris,Colobus spp., and Chelonoidis carbonaria). Samples sequenced by the Sanger methodwere also subjected to Illumina MiSeq amplicon deep sequencing. The amplicon deepsequencing results (average of 302,080 usable reads per sample) replicated thehost community revealed using Sanger sequencing, and detected additional hosts infive triatomines (13.9%), including two additional blood sources (Procyon lotorand Bassariscus astutus). Up to four bloodmeal sources were detected in a single triatomine (I. nebulifer, Homo sapiens, C. lupus familiaris, and S.carolinensis). Enhanced understanding of vector-host-parasite networks may allow for integrated vector management programs focusing on highly-utilized andhighly-infected host species.

AB  - Elevated glucocorticoid (GC) concentrations associated with captivity-relatedstress have been linked to impaired testicular function and low sperm quality in felids, but direct physiological evidence is lacking. This study assessed theeffects of exogenous GC treatment on felid testicular function using the domesticcat (Felis catus) as a model species. Sixteen intact male cats aged 2.4 +/- 0.8years (mean +/- SEM) were divided randomly into treatment (n = 8) and control (n = 8) groups. Treatment cats were given 1 mg kg(-1) oral prednisolone daily for 50days. Blood samples were taken on Days 0 (first prednisolone treatment), 2, 4, 7,10, 20, 30, 40, 50 (prior to neutering) and 60 of the trial. All cats wereorchiectomised on day 50, epididymal sperm assessed, and the testes fixed forhistological assessment. Testosterone concentrations did not differ between thetwo groups. While sperm motility was similar between the treatment and controlgroups, cats given prednisolone had a higher proportion of morphologicallyabnormal sperm in both the caput (72.5% vs. 59.6%, P < 0.001) and cauda (56.7%vs. 35.8%, P < 0.001) epididymis. Testicular histomorphometric data and totalnumber of germ cells per seminiferous tubule cross section did not differ betweengroups, nor did the relative abundance of spermatogonia, spermatocytes, andspermatids. Cats given prednisolone had fewer Sertoli cells per tubulecross-section than those in the control group (17.1 +/- 0.9 vs. 19.7 +/- 0.8, P =0.04), which was likely related to higher rates of Sertoli cell apoptosis intreatment versus control cats (0.25 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.10 +/- 0.02 apoptotic Sertoli cells per tubule, respectively; P < 0.001). Sertoli cell load (number of germcells per Sertoli cell) was also higher in the treatment group than in thecontrol group (11.5 +/- 0.8 vs. 9.4 +/- 1.2 germ cells per Sertoli cell,respectively; P < 0.001), and was positively correlated with the percentage ofmorphologically abnormal sperm in the epididymis (r(2) = 0.78, P < 0.001).Prednisolone treatment resulted in an increase in the proportion of abnormalsperm in the epididymis, which may be explained by an increased nurturing demand on a reduced Sertoli cell population. These findings provide novel evidence tosupport the hypothesis that elevated GC concentrations, such as those resultingfrom captivity-related stress, have the potential to impair testicular functionand sperm quality in felids.

LID - 10.1177/1098612X221104066 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the short-term safety andefficacy of fenofibrate in controlling secondary hypertriglyceridemia in cats.METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study. Seventeen adult cats withhypertriglyceridemia (serum triglycerides [TG] >160 mg/dl) were enrolled. Catsreceived a median dose of 5 mg/kg (range 3.2-6) fenofibrate (q24h PO) for 1month. Serum TG, total cholesterol (TC), creatine kinase and liver enzymes(alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase)were evaluated before (t0) and after 1 month (t1) of fenofibrate treatment.RESULTS: The causes of secondary hypertriglyceridemia were diabetes mellitus (DM;29.4%), obesity (29.4%), hyperadrenocorticism (HAC) and DM (11.7%), HAC withoutDM (5.9%), hypersomatotropism (HST) and DM (5.9%), hypothyroidism (5.9%),long-term treatment with glucocorticoids (5.9%) and chylothorax (5.9%). Serum TG (t0 median 920 mg/dl [range 237-1780]; t1 median 51 mg/dl [range 21-1001]; P =0.0002) and TC (t0 median 278 mg/dl [range 103-502]; t1 median 156 mg/dl [range66-244]; P = 0.0001) concentrations showed a significant decrease after 1 monthof fenofibrate treatment. Fifteen cats normalized their TG concentration at t1(88.2%). Of the eight cats that were hypercholesterolemic at t0, six (75%)normalized their TC concentrations at t1. One of 17 cats (5.9 %) presented withdiarrhea; the remaining 16 did not show any adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS ANDRELEVANCE: DM and obesity are the most common endocrine causes of secondaryhyperlipidemia, although it can also be found in cats with HAC, HST orhypothyroidism. This study suggests that fenofibrate treatment was associatedwith reduction and normalization of TG and TC concentrations in cats withmoderate and severe hypertriglyceridemia, regardless of the cause of secondaryhypertriglyceridemia. Further work should focus on controlled studies with agreater number of cases.

TI  - Comparing adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells with prednisolone for thetreatment of feline inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - e244-e250
LID - 10.1177/1098612X221104053 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of felinemesenchymal stem cells (fMSC) with prednisolone as a treatment for inflammatorybowel disease (IBD) in cats. METHODS: Cats with chronic enteropathy that failed a2-week diet trial and were not found to have significant concurrent disease were eligible for the study. If endoscopic biopsies confirmed a histopathologicdiagnosis of IBD, the cat was randomly assigned to either the fMSC orprednisolone groups. Owners were blinded to the grouping. Stem cell treatmentconsisted of two intravenous injections of 2 x 10(6) cells/kg of freshly culturedallogeneic stem cells separated by 2 weeks. Prednisolone treatment was 1-2 mg/kg PO q24h, tapered according to clinical response. Owners were asked to make nochanges (eg, diet and other medications) for the first 2 months, at which timethey either continued to the 6-month recheck with no changes, or 'failed'treatment and owners were unblinded and changes made as necessary. RESULTS: Sixprednisolone and six fMSC treatment cats completed the study. All sixprednisolone group cats were spayed females with a mean age of 8.3 years (range2-14), a mean body weight of 3.6 kg (range 2.5-4.8) and a mean pretreatmentFeline Chronic Enteropathy Activity Index (FCEAI) score of 3.6 (range 2-6). Thesix stem cell cats included three spayed females and three castrated males, andhad a mean age of 8.0 years (range 4.5-13), a mean body weight of 4.9 kg (range4.0-5.9) and a mean pretreatment FCEAI score of 3.7 (range 2-5). One cat in each group failed at the 2-month recheck. At the 6-month recheck, the mean FCEAI scorefor the prednisolone group was 3.7 (range 0.5-9) and 0.75 (range 0-1.5) for thefMSC group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results suggest that this specificfMSC protocol appears to be as effective in the treatment of feline IBD as astandard course of prednisolone therapy.

LID - 10.1111/jsap.13524 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify and describe the type and frequency of perioperativefactors in dogs and cats undergoing pancreatic surgery under referral care.METHODS: Medical records from a small animal surgical referral practice wereretrospectively reviewed to identify dogs and cats that underwent pancreaticsurgery between 2008 and 2019. Inclusion criteria included complete medicalrecord, histopathology results and follow-up of at least 14 days postoperatively or until death. Variables collected included signalment, history, presentingcomplaint, preoperative diagnostic results, intraoperative complications,surgical findings/procedures, postoperative complications and histopathologyresults. Cases were excluded if pertinent information or a histopathology report was missing from the medical record. The frequency of these variables wasreported. RESULTS: There were 81 client-owned animals identified that met theinclusion criteria (57 dogs and 24 cats). The most common pancreatic procedureperformed in dogs was partial pancreatectomy 63.2% (36/57) and in cats waspancreatic biopsy 62.5% (15/24). The most common histologic diagnosis in dogs waspancreatic islet cell carcinoma 50.9% (29/57) and in cats was pancreatitis 41.7% (10/24). The overall mortality rate was 13.6% (11/81), with a 10.5% (6/57)mortality rate in dogs and a 20.8% (5/24) mortality rate in cats. CLINICALSIGNIFICANCE: In this series of dogs and cats, pancreatic surgery under referral care carried a low to moderate mortality rate.

TI  - Hyperthyroid cats and their kidneys: a literature review.
LID - 10.1111/avj.13179 [doi]
AB  - Hyperthyroidism and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are common diseases of geriatriccats, and often occur concurrently. Thus, a thorough understanding of theinfluence of thyroid function on renal function is of significant value for allfeline practitioners. Among other effects, hyperthyroidism causes proteincatabolism and increases renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR).These effects render traditional renal markers insensitive for the detection ofCKD in cats with uncontrolled hyperthyroidism. Furthermore, the development ofiatrogenic hypothyroidism with over treatment of hyperthyroidism can bedetrimental to renal function and may negatively affect long-term survival. This review discusses important diagnostic considerations of feline hyperthyroidism,as well as key treatment modalities, with an emphasis on the use of radioiodineand the importance of post treatment monitoring of thyroid and renal parameters. In Australia, a common curative treatment for cats with benign hyperthyroidism(i.e. thyroid hyperplasia or adenoma) is a fixed dose of orally administeredradioiodine, regardless of the serum total thyroxine concentration at the time ofdiagnosis. This review discusses the long term outcomes of this standard of care in comparison with current, relevant research literature from around the world.Finally, this review explores the use of symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) inassessing renal function before and after treatment in hyperthyroid cats. SDMAcorrelates well with GFR and creatinine in non-hyperthyroid cats, but ourunderstanding of its performance in hyperthyroid cats remains in its infancy.

TI  - In-depth comparative analysis of Tritrichomonas foetus transcriptomics revealsnovel genes linked with adaptation to feline host.
PG  - 10057
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-14310-x [doi]
AB  - Tritrichomonas foetus is a flagellated parasite able to infect cattle, cats, and pigs. Despite its prevalence, feline tritrichomonosis has received markedly less attention than venereal infection, and little information about the molecularmechanisms that participate in feline host infection is available. Through abioinformatics approach, we integrated public transcriptomic data for three T.foetus isolates and explored the differences at transcript level with a focus on pathogenesis and adaptation processes, particularly for the feline isolate. Ouranalysis revealed higher abundance levels of predicted virulence factors, such asproteases and surface antigens. Additionally, by a comparative and expressionanalysis of T. foetus genes, we proposed putative virulence factors that could beinvolved in feline infection. Finally, we identified a great proportion ofpredicted transcription factors of the MYB protein family and, by a promoteranalysis, we revealed that MYB-related proteins could participate in theregulation of gene transcription in T. foetus. In conclusion, this integratedapproach is a valuable resource for future studies of host-pathogen interactions and identifying new gene targets for improved feline tritrichomonosis diagnosisand treatment.

TI  - Cat predation of Kangaroo Island dunnarts in aftermath of bushfire.
PG  - 7272
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-11383-6 [doi]
AB  - The Kangaroo Island dunnart (Sminthopsis aitkeni) is a critically endangeredmarsupial species with an estimated population of ~ 500 individuals found only onthe western end of Australia's third largest island. Severe bushfires recentlyburnt more than 98% of its known and predicted habitat that was already underpressure from fragmentation. After the fires, we found evidence of eightindividual dunnarts in the digestive tract of seven feral cats, out of the 86collected in remaining unburnt refugia; thus demonstrating the need of immediate risk management efforts after large-scale stochastic events.

TI  - Genetic epidemiology of blood type, disease and trait variants, and genome-widegenetic diversity in over 11,000 domestic cats.
PG  - e1009804
LID - 10.1371/journal.pgen.1009804 [doi]
AB  - In the largest DNA-based study of domestic cats to date, 11,036 individuals(10,419 pedigreed cats and 617 non-pedigreed cats) were genotyped via commercial panel testing elucidating the distribution and frequency of known disease, blood type, and physical trait associated genetic variants across cat breeds. Thisstudy provides allele frequencies for many disease-associated variants for thefirst time and provides updates on previously reported information with evidence suggesting that DNA testing has been effectively used to reduce diseaseassociated variants within certain pedigreed cat populations over time. Weidentified 13 disease-associated variants in 47 breeds or breed types in whichthe variant had not previously been documented, highlighting the relevance ofcomprehensive genetic screening across breeds. Three disease-associated variants were discovered in non-pedigreed cats only. To investigate the causality of nine disease-associated variants in cats of different breed backgrounds ourveterinarians conducted owner interviews, reviewed clinical records, and invited cats to have follow-up clinical examinations. Additionally, genetic variantsdetermining blood types A, B and AB, which are relevant clinically and in catbreeding, were genotyped. Appearance-associated genetic variation in all cats is also discussed. Lastly, genome-wide SNP heterozygosity levels were calculated to obtain a comparable measure of the genetic diversity in different cat breeds.This study represents the first comprehensive exploration of informativeMendelian variants in felines by screening over 10,000 pedigreed cats. Theresults qualitatively contribute to the understanding of feline variant heritage and genetic diversity and demonstrate the clinical utility and importance of suchinformation in supporting breeding programs and the research community. The work also highlights the crucial commitment of pedigreed cat breeders and registriesin supporting the establishment of large genomic databases, that when combinedwith phenotype information can advance scientific understanding and provideinsights that can be applied to improve the health and welfare of cats.

TI  - Psychometric properties and CAT performance of the PROMIS pediatric sleepdisturbance, sleep-related impairment, and fatigue item banks in Dutch childrenand adolescents.
LID - 10.1037/pas0001150 [doi]
AB  - This study's aim is to evaluate the psychometric properties of the pediatricPatient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) sleepdisturbance (SD), sleep-related impairment (SRI), and fatigue item banks in Dutchchildren and adolescents since they are yet to be validated in this population.Children and adolescents aged 8-18 years old (n = 1,325), representative of theDutch general population, were invited. The following psychometric properties of both item banks were assessed: structural validity by fitting a graded responsemodel (GRM) for which assumptions were checked and assessing item fit,reliability, and efficiency for the full-length item bank, short forms, andcomputerized adaptive test (CAT). Mean T scores and cutoff scores for mild,moderate, and severe scores were determined. A total of 527 children (responserate 39.7%) were included. SD did not meet the assumption of unidimensionality.The SRI and fatigue item banks showed sufficient structural validity. Three itemsshowed GRM misfit; SRI item w026c and fatigue items 3224R1r and 4191R1r. Bothitem banks measured reliable (> .90) at the mean of the population and 2SD in theclinical direction. CATs outperformed short forms in efficiency. Mean T scoresfor the Dutch population were: SRI 47.5 (SD = 10.0) and fatigue 39.8 (SD = 12.4).Cutoffs included SRI minimal >/= 34.7, moderate >/= 55.6, severe >/= 63.2 andfatigue minimal >/= 23.9, moderate >/= 49.9, severe >/= 61.3. PROMIS pediatricSRI and fatigue item banks, short forms, and CAT showed sufficient structuralvalidity and reliability in the Dutch population. Dutch reference values areprovided. More research is needed for the PROMIS SD item bank. (PsycInfo DatabaseRecord (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).

TI  - A review of public health important fleas (Insecta, Siphonaptera) and flea-borne diseases in India.
PG  - 12-21
LID - 10.4103/0972-9062.328977 [doi]
AB  - Fleas (Insecta, Siphonaptera) are important vectors of plague and murine typhusin many parts of the world. Currently, about 2700 flea species were described in the world. The most common vector flea Xenopsylla cheopis is found throughoutIndia, but X. astia, and X. brasiliensis are found less and limited indistribution associated with the domestic rats such as Rattus rattus, R.norvegicus, Mus musculus, and Bandicota bengalensis. Bubonic plague is a majorflea-borne disease caused by the bacterial pathogen Yersinia pestis, transmitted from rats to humans via the rodent flea, X. cheopis. A major outbreak of plagueand high mortality occurred in India. After 1966 with the 3 decadal intervals,plague cases occurred only during the year 1994 reported in 5 different states(Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and New Delhi andsubsequently plague cases occurred during 2002 and 2004 after the one-decadeinterval in Himachal Pradesh (2002). Another outbreak of bubonic plague wasreported in Dangud village, Barkhot tehsil, Uttarkashi district, Uttarakhandduring October 2004. Ctenocephalides fleas are common in cats and dogs, which arethe main vectors of bacteria rickettsiae, such as Rickettsia typhi, R. felis, R. conorii, and Bartonella henselae. Molecular and serological evidence alsoconfirms the presence of R. typhi, R. conorii R. felis and B. henselae pathogens in cats and other fleas in India. Flea bites and flea-borne dermatitis are commonin men and pet animals. Because of the re-emergence of the plague, updatedinformation on fleas and flea-borne diseases are essential to control the fleavectors and flea-borne diseases in India. Hence, this comprehensive reviewupdates the available information on fleas and fleas transmitted diseases inIndia.

TI  - Investigated regional apparent diffusion coefficient values of themorphologically normal feline brain.
PG  - e214-e222
LID - 10.1177/1098612X221101535 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) MRI is increasingly available inveterinary medicine for investigation of the brain. However, apparent diffusioncoefficient (ADC) values have only been reported in a small number of cats or in research settings. The aim of this study was to investigate the ADC values ofdifferent anatomical regions of the morphologically normal brain in a felinepatient population. Additionally, we aimed to assess the possible influence onthe ADC values of different patient-related factors, such as sex, body weight,age, imaging of the left and right side of the cerebral hemispheres and white vs grey matter regions. METHODS: This retrospective study included cats undergoingan MRI (3T) examination with DWI sequences of the head at the Vetsuisse Facultyof the University Zurich between 2015 and 2021. Only cats with morphologicallynormal brains were included. On the ADC maps, 10 regions of interest (ROIs) were manually drawn on the following anatomical regions: caudate nucleus; internalcapsule (two locations); piriform lobe; thalamus; hippocampus; cortex cerebri(two locations); cerebellar hemisphere; and one ROI in the centre of thecerebellar vermis. Except for the ROI at the cerebellar vermis, each ROI wasdrawn in the left and right hemisphere. The ADC values were calculated by thesoftware and recorded. RESULTS: A total of 129 cats were included in this study. The ADC varied in the different ROIs, with the highest mean ADC value in thehippocampus and the lowest in the cerebellar hemisphere. ADC was significantlylower in the white cerebral matter compared with the grey matter. ADC values werenot influenced by age, with the exception of the hippocampus and the cingulategyrus. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: ADC values of different anatomical regions ofthe morphologically normal feline brain in a patient population of 129 cats in a clinical setting are reported for the first time.

TI  - The role of pets in SARS-CoV-2 transmission: an exploratory analysis.
LID - 10.1007/s15010-022-01860-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: There is evidence that humans can transmit SARS-CoV-2 to cats and dogs. However, there is no evidence that they can transmit it back to humans or playany role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Here, we present an exploratory analysis on that matter. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study with participants withflu-like symptoms seeking care at a primary healthcare unit to be tested forCOVID-19. They were asked if they owned pet cats and/or dogs in their residences,and this variable was evaluated as exposure. RESULTS: The odds ratio of "havingdogs and/or cats in the residence" was 1.29 (95% CI 1.08-1.54) of "having onlydogs and no cats" was 1.26 (1.05-1.52), and "no dogs and only cats" was 1.29(0.95-1.75). CONCLUSION: Having a cat/dog in the house can affect the risk ofinfection by SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Current blood tests to diagnose feline liver diseases are suboptimal.Serum concentrations of microRNA (miR)-122 have been shown in humans, dogs androdents to be a sensitive and specific biomarker for liver injury. To explore thepotential diagnostic utility of measuring serum concentrations of miR-122 incats, miR-122 was measured in a cohort of ill, hospitalised cats with known serumalanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity. METHODS: In this retrospective study,cats were grouped into those with an ALT activity within the reference interval(0-83 U/l; n = 38) and those with an abnormal ALT activity (>84 U/l; n = 25).Serum concentrations of miR-122 were measured by real-time quantitative PCR andthe relationship between miR-122 and ALT was examined. RESULTS: miR-122 wassignificantly higher in the group with high ALT activity than the ALT group,within normal reference limits (P <0.0004). There was also a moderately positive correlation between serum ALT activity and miR-122 concentrations (P <0.001; r = 0.52). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Concentrations of miR-122 were reliablyquantified in feline serum and were higher in a cohort of cats with increased ALTactivity than in cats with normal ALT activity. This work highlights thepotential diagnostic utility of miR-122 as a biomarker of liver damage in catsand encourages further investigation to determine the sensitivity and specificityof miR-122 as a biomarker of hepatocellular injury in this species.

TI  - Golden cats: A never-ending story!
LID - 10.1111/age.13228 [doi]
AB  - In the British feline breed a golden coat modification, called light-gold, akita or copper, was reported by breeders during the 2010s. This modificationrestricted eumelanin to the tip of the tail and hairs showed a widebandmodification. Pedigree analyses revealed an autosomal recessive inheritancepattern. A single candidate region was identified using a genome-wide associationstudy. Within that region, we identified CORIN (Corin, serine peptidase) as thestrongest candidate gene, since two CORIN variants have previously beenidentified in Siberian cats with a golden phenotype. A homozygous CORIN:c.2425C>Tnonsense variant was identified in copper British cats. Segregation of thevariant was consistent with recessive inheritance. This nonsense CORIN:c.2425C>T variant, located in CORIN exon 19, was predicted to produce a truncated CORINprotein - CORIN:p.(Arg809Ter) - that would lack part of the scavenger receptordomain and the trypsine-like serine protease catalytic domain. All 30 copper catswere T/T homozygous for the variant, which was also found in 20 C/T heterozygous British control cats but was absent in 340 cats from the 99 Lives dataset.Finally, genotyping of 218 cats from 12 breeds failed to identify carriers incats from other breeds. We propose that this third CORIN:c.2425C>T variantrepresents the wb(BSH) (British recessive wideband) allele in the domestic cat.

LID - 10.1002/vetr.1730 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: End-of-life decisions for companion animals can be stressful forveterinarians and owners, and when delayed result in poor animal welfare. Delayedeuthanasia has been identified as a particularly prominent issue for horses. Thisscoping review aimed to identify the available literature on veterinarydecision-making models, which can support end-of-life planning. METHODS: Aprotocol was preregistered, and a structured literature search was performed onsix electronic databases. Publications were reviewed against specificallydeveloped eligibility criteria. Data from original studies and narrative-typereviews were extracted separately, and the components of each model were charted.RESULTS: A total of 2211 publications were identified, 23 met the inclusioncriteria and were included in the final review. Eight were original researchstudies and 15 were narrative reviews or similar. Publications were not indexeduniformly, increasing the difficulty of discovering relevant sources. Theend-of-life decision-making process comprised three stages: (1) making thedecision, (2) enacting the decision and (3) aftercare. Twenty key components ofdecision-making models were identified, although no publication reflected all of these. CONCLUSIONS: A lack of original research studies and equine-specificpublications was identified. Shared decision-making models for euthanasia inveterinary practice should include all three stages and consider species-specificissues.

TI  - Construct Validity of Pediatric PROMIS Computerized Adaptive Testing Measures in Children With Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis.
PG  - e720-e726
LID - 10.1097/BPO.0000000000002190 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of patient-reported outcome measures, especiallyPatient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures, hasincreased in recent years. Given this growth, it is imperative to ensure that themeasures being used are validated for the intended population(s)/disease(s). Our objective was to assess the construct validity of 8 PROMIS computer adaptivetesting (CAT) measures among children with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS).METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 200 children (aged 10 to 17 y) with AIS, whocompleted 8 PROMIS CATs (Anxiety, Depressive Symptoms, Mobility, Pain Behavior,Pain Interference, Peer Relationships, Physical Activity, Physical StressExperiences) and the Scoliosis Research Society-22r questionnaire (SRS-22r)electronically. Treatment categories were observation, bracing, indicated forsurgery, or postoperative from posterior spinal fusion. Construct validity wasevaluated using known group analysis and convergent and discriminant validityanalyses. Analysis of variance was used to identify differences in PROMIS T-scores by treatment category (known groups). The Spearman rank correlationcoefficient ( rs ) was calculated between corresponding PROMIS and SRS-22rdomains (convergent) and between unrelated PROMIS domains (discriminant).Floor/ceiling effects were calculated. RESULTS: Among treatment categories,significant differences were found in PROMIS Mobility, Pain Behavior, PainInterference, and Physical Stress Experiences and in all SRS-22r domains ( P<0.05) except Mental Health ( P =0.15). SRS-22r Pain was strongly correlated withPROMIS Pain Interference ( rs =-0.72) and Pain Behavior ( rs =-0.71) andmoderately correlated with Physical Stress Experiences ( rs =-0.57). SRS-22rMental Health was strongly correlated with PROMIS Depressive Symptoms ( rs=-0.72) and moderately correlated with Anxiety ( rs =-0.62). SRS-22r Function wasmoderately correlated with PROMIS Mobility ( rs =0.64) and weakly correlated withPhysical Activity ( rs =0.34). SRS-22r Self-Image was weakly correlated withPROMIS Peer Relationships ( rs =0.33). All unrelated PROMIS CATs were weaklycorrelated (| rs |<0.40). PROMIS Anxiety, Mobility, Pain Behavior, and PainInterference and SRS-22r Function, Pain, and Satisfaction displayed ceilingeffects. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence supports the construct validity of 6 PROMIS CATsin evaluating AIS patients. Ceiling effects should be considered when usingspecific PROMIS CATs. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prognostic.

LID - 10.1159/000524177 [doi]
AB  - A 30-year-old woman was pointed out for her right axillary lymphadenopathy in amedical checkup. Ultrasonography showed two swollen lymph nodes and the presence of lymph node hilum with a convex shape in the larger lymph node. Under thetentative diagnosis of lymphadenitis, the patient was initially treated withantibiotic therapy, leading to no improvement in her lymphadenopathy for 1 month.Positron emission tomography after antibiotic therapy showed a maximumstandardized uptake value of 7.0 in the swollen lymph nodes without any otheravidities. Neither mammography nor ultrasonography showed any abnormalities inthe breasts. The serum IL-2R level was within the normal range. Despite the lack of malignant cells in the aspiration biopsy cytology specimen, the patientreceived lymph node excisional biopsy to avoid undertreatment. A postoperativepathological study showed a swollen lymph node with preserved lymph nodestructure, follicular hyperplasia, and lymphoid hyperplasia. The irregularlydilated germinal center had microglanulomas, tingible body macrophages, enlarged aggregation of monocytoid B cells with neutrophil interminglement, and no giantcells, leading to the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis. A detailed interview after the lymph node biopsy revealed that she did not have any cats but had chickens andhad her right forearm a little injured by the roof edge of a chicken coop 5 weeksbefore the medical checkup. Postoperative serologic testing to further confirmthe toxoplasma infection showed elevated IgG and IgM antibody levels. Oncologistsand infectious disease specialists should note this type of transmission oftoxoplasma gondii and unilateral lymphadenopathy as an important clinicalmanifestation of toxoplasmosis.

TI  - Potential risk factors for the presence of anti-Toxoplasma gondii antibodies infinishing pigs on conventional farms in the Netherlands.
PG  - 27
LID - 10.1186/s40813-022-00272-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The parasite Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) causes a substantial humandisease burden worldwide. Ingesting improperly cooked pork containing T. gondiiis considered one of the major sources of human infection in Europe and NorthAmerica. Consequently, control of T. gondii infections in pigs is warranted. The European Food Safety Authority advised to perform serological monitoring of pigs and to conduct farm audits for the presence of risk factors. Serologicalmonitoring was implemented in several Dutch slaughterhouses, one to six bloodsamples (a total of 5134 samples) were taken from each delivery of finishing pigsand samples were tested for the presence of anti-T. gondii antibodies. Usingthese test results, a cross-sectional study was initiated to assess theassociation between the within-herd T. gondii seroprevalence and the presence of risk factors for T. gondii infections at 69 conventional finishing pig farms inthe Netherlands. RESULTS: A multivariable model showed significant (P </= 0.05)association with twelve potential risk factors: type of farm, presence of dogs,presence of ruminants, use of boots, use of shower and farm clothing, mode ofrodent control, bedding accessibility for rodents, presence of cats, type ofdrinking water, heating of the feed, use of goat whey and shielding of birds.CONCLUSIONS: Serological monitoring of finishing pigs for T. gondii inslaughterhouses can be used to identify the presence of T. gondii risk factors onDutch conventional finishing pig farms and seems a valuable tool to guide andmonitor the control of T. gondii in pork production.

TI  - Cytochrome P450 2J (CYP2J) Genes in Dogs, Cats, and Pigs Are Expressed and EncodeFunctional Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes.
LID - DMD-AR-2022-000930 [pii]
LID - 10.1124/dmd.122.000930 [doi]
AB  - Cytochromes P450 (P450 or CYP) have been identified and analyzed in dogs andpigs, species that are often used in preclinical drug studies. Moreover, P450sare clinically important for drug therapy not only in humans but also in species under veterinary care, including dogs and cats. In the present study, seven P450shomologous to human CYP2J2, namely, dog CYP2J2; cat CYP2J2; and pig CYP2J33,CYP2J34, CYP2J35, CYP2J91, and CYP2J93, were newly identified and characterized. The cDNAs of these CYP2Js contained open reading frames of 502 amino acids,except for CYP2J35 (498 amino acids), and shared high sequence identity (77-80%) with human CYP2J2. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that dog and cat CYP2J2 wereclosely related, whereas pig CYP2Js formed a cluster. All seven CYP2J genescontain nine coding exons and are located in corresponding genomic regions, with the pig CYP2J genes forming a gene cluster. These CYP2J2 mRNAs were predominantlyexpressed in small intestine with additional expression in kidney and brain fordog CYP2J2 and pig CYP2J91 mRNAs, respectively. All seven CYP2Js metabolizedhuman CYP2J2 substrates terfenadine, ebastine, and astemizole, indicating thatthey are functional enzymes. Dog CYP2J2 and pig CYP2J34 and CYP2J35 efficientlycatalyzed ebastine primary hydroxylation and secondary carebastine formation atlow substrate concentrations, just as human CYP2J2 does. Velocity-versus-substateplots exhibited sigmoidal relationships for dog CYP2J2, cat CYP2J2, and pigCYP2J33, indicating allosteric interactions. These results suggest that dog, cat,and pig CYP2Js have similar functional characteristics to human CYP2J2, withslight differences in ebastine and astemizole oxidations. Significance Statement New dog cytochrome P450 2J2 (CYP2J2); cat CYP2J2; and pig CYP2J33, CYP2J34,CYP2J35, CYP2J91, and CYP2J93, homologous to human CYP2J2, were identified andcharacterized by sequence, phylogenetic, and genomic structure analyses.Intestinal expression patterns of CYP2J mRNAs were characteristic in dogs, cats, and pigs. Dog, cat, and pig CYP2Js likely play roles as drug-metabolizing enzymesin small intestine, similar to human CYP2J2.

AB  - Acyline contraception has been described in cats, but few data are available onthe drug's long-term effect on growth. The relevant data cover until puberty withno radiographic description. We investigated the radiographic parametersthroughout bone growth in order to more completely determine the drug's safety.Thirteen male and 12 female cats were studied, with the kittens being randomlyassigned to one of the following groups within the first 24 hours of birth: ACY, subcutaneous acyline, 33 microg/100 g, which injection was repeated weekly until age 3 months; or CO, untreated control. Body measurements were recorded weeklyand radiographic parameters obtained from monthly radiographs of theantebrachium. In the ACY and CO male and female kittens, the body weight, withersheight, and body length plus the age at the end of body growth and radial growth remained similar throughout the study (P> .05). Both female groups finishedradial growth before the males (P< .05). The ACY females evidenced a longerradial length between the eighth and 28th weeks (P< .05). All groups closed theirproximal and distal physes within the normal ranges described for the species.The bone-cortex width was lower in the ACY vs. the CO animals at weeks 52 and 60 in the males and at weeks 24, 48, 52, and 56 in the females (P< .05) Thetransient greater radial length and lower bone-cortex thickness observed in thetreated cats were compensated for at the end of growth with no adverse clinicaleffects being observed. In conclusion, acyline as a contraceptive did notevidence a permanent or severe effect on domestic-cat growth.

AB  - The isolation of CCoV-HuPn-2018 from a child respiratory swab indicates that morecoronaviruses are spilling over to humans than previously appreciated. Wedetermined the structures of the CCoV-HuPn-2018 spike glycoprotein trimer in two distinct conformational states and showed that its domain 0 recognizessialosides. We identified that the CCoV-HuPn-2018 spike binds canine, feline, andporcine aminopeptidase N (APN) orthologs, which serve as entry receptors, anddetermined the structure of the receptor-binding B domain in complex with canine APN. The introduction of an oligosaccharide at position N739 of human APN renderscells susceptible to CCoV-HuPn-2018 spike-mediated entry, suggesting thatsingle-nucleotide polymorphisms might account for viral detection in someindividuals. Human polyclonal plasma antibodies elicited by HCoV-229E infectionand a porcine coronavirus monoclonal antibody inhibit CCoV-HuPn-2018spike-mediated entry, underscoring the cross-neutralizing activity amonga-coronaviruses. These data pave the way for vaccine and therapeutic development targeting this zoonotic pathogen representing the eighth human-infectingcoronavirus.

AB  - Anticoagulant rodenticides (ARs) are used worldwide for the control of rodentpests and are the main method of control of rat pest populations in agricultural areas. The main aim of this review is to discuss the risk of ARs to non-targetwildlife in oil palm areas in Southeast Asia, mainly Indonesia and Malaysia. Wediscussed AR use in oil palm areas and toxicities of ARs on target and non-targetanimals. We also reviewed published literature on wildlife species reported inoil palm areas in Southeast Asia and utilizing this information, we assessed the hazard risk of ARs to non-target wildlife in oil palm plantations. ARs are asecondary exposure hazard to rodent-consuming mammalian carnivores, such asleopard cats and civets, and rodent-consuming raptors, such as barn owls.Consumption of dead poisoned prey puts scavengers, such as water monitors, athigh risk for AR exposure. Domestic livestock and granivorous birds are at highrisk for AR exposure via primary exposure to toxic bait, while omnivores such as macaques and wild pigs are at moderate risk for both primary and secondaryexposure to ARs. The effects of ARs on barn owls have been well studied in thefield and in laboratory secondary toxicity studies. Thus, the nest-box occupancy and reproductive parameters of local barn owl populations can be monitored as an indicator of the AR exposure level in the area. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: No clinical trials were involved in this study.

TI  - [2+3] Amide Cages by Oxidation of [2+3] Imine Cages - Revisiting Molecular Hosts for Highly Efficient Nitrate Binding.
PG  - e202201527
LID - 10.1002/chem.202201527 [doi]
AB  - The pollution of groundwater with nitrate is a serious issue because nitrate can cause several diseases such as methemoglobinemia or cancer. Therefore, selective removal of nitrate by efficient binding to supramolecular hosts is highlydesired. Here we describe how to make [2+3] amide cages in very high toquantitative yields by applying an optimized Pinnick oxidation protocol for theconversion of corresponding imine cages. By NMR titration experiments of theeight different [2+3] amide cages with nitrate, chloride and hydrogen sulfate we identified one cage with an unprecedented high selectivity towards nitratebinding vs. chloride (S=705) or hydrogensulfate (S>13500) in CD2 Cl2 /CD3 CN (1 :3). NMR experiments as well as single-crystal structure comparison of host-guest complexes give insight into structure-property-relationships.

AB  - In Portugal, the relinquishment of dogs and cats is a major problem. Thus, theauthors developed a questionnaire to understand the factors influencing therelinquishment of companion animals in Portugal. With a view to analyze thefactors behind relinquishment by companion animal guardians, the authors analyzedsurveys completed by 72 participants, divided into two groups: REL (relinquisher,n = 36), i.e., guardians who had relinquished a companion animal and NREL(non-relinquisher, n = 36) i.e., guardians who had never relinquished a companionanimal. The only significant factors for the REL group were the presence ofchildren and the type of dwelling (apartment). Additionally, the duration ofguardianship of the companion animal before relinquishment (REL group) wassignificantly shorter if there were children in the household than if there were no children.

TI  - Tonotopic Selectivity in Cats and Humans: Electrophysiology and Psychophysics.
LID - 10.1007/s10162-022-00851-5 [doi]
AB  - We describe a scalp-recorded measure of tonotopic selectivity, the "corticalonset response" (COR) and compare the results between humans and cats. The CORresults, in turn, were compared with psychophysical masked-detection thresholdsobtained using similar stimuli and obtained from both species. The COR consisted of averaged responses elicited by 50-ms tone-burst probes presented at 1-sintervals against a continuous noise masker. The noise masker had a bandwidth of 1 or 1/8th octave, geometrically centred on 4000 Hz for humans and on 8000 Hz forcats. The probe frequency was either - 0.5, - 0.25, 0, 0.25 or 0.5 octaves re themasker centre frequency. The COR was larger for probe frequencies more distantfrom the centre frequency of the masker, and this effect was greater for the1/8th-octave than for the 1-octave masker. This pattern broadly reflected themasked excitation patterns obtained psychophysically with similar stimuli in bothspecies. However, the positive signal-to-noise ratio used to obtain reliable COR measures meant that some aspects of the data differed from those obtainedpsychophysically, in a way that could be partly explained by the upward spread ofthe probe's excitation pattern. Our psychophysical measurements also showed that the auditory filter width obtained at 8000 Hz using notched-noise maskers wasslightly wider in cat than previous measures from humans. We argue that although conclusions from COR measures differ in some ways from conclusions based onpsychophysics, the COR measures provide an objective, noninvasive, valid measure of tonotopic selectivity that does not require training and that may be appliedto acoustic and cochlear-implant experiments in humans and laboratory animals.

AB  - Emerging influenza virus poses a health threat to humans and animals. Domesticcats have recently been identified as a potential source of zoonotic influenzavirus. The influenza virus minigenome replication system based on the ribonucleicacid (RNA) polymerase I (PolI) promoter is the most widely used tool forinvestigating polymerase activity. It could help determine host factors or viral proteins influencing influenza virus polymerase activity in vitro. However,influenza virus polymerase activity has never been studied in feline cells thusfar. In the present study, the feline RNA PolI promoter was identified in theintergenic spacer regions between adjacent upstream 28S and downstream 18S rRNAgenes in the cat (Felis catus) genome using bioinformatics strategies. Thetranscription initiation site of the feline RNA PolI promoter was predicted. The feline RNA PolI promoter was cloned from CRFK cells, and a promoter size of 250bp contained a sequence with sufficient PolI promoter activity by adual-luciferase reporter assay. The influenza virus minigenome replication systembased on the feline RNA PolI promoter was then established. Using this system,the feline RNA PolI promoter was determined to have significantly highertranscriptional activity than the human and chicken RNA PolI promoters in feline cells, and equine (H3N8) influenza virus presented higher polymerase activitythan human (H1N1) and canine (H3N2) influenza viruses. In addition, felinemyxovirus resistance protein 1 (Mx1) and baloxavir were observed to inhibitinfluenza virus polymerase activity in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. Ourstudy will help further investigations on the molecular mechanism of hostadaptation and cross-species transmission of influenza virus in cats.

AB  - Case summary: A 7-year-old female neutered domestic shorthair cat was presentedwith weight loss, abdominal distension, lethargy, pyrexia and hyporexia.Haematology and biochemistry were unremarkable. Abdominal ultrasound revealed acystic mass within the left cranial abdominal quadrant, adjacent to the pancreas,stomach and spleen. CT revealed a 10.5 cm, rounded, well-encapsulated, hypodense mass arising from the left pancreatic lobe. The remaining organs of the abdominaland thoracic cavity were unremarkable. A partial left lobe pancreatectomy andsplenic lymph node removal were performed. Histopathology of the pancreatic mass reported a proliferating population of neoplastic spindle cells most consistentwith a preliminary diagnosis of soft tissue sarcoma. Immunohistochemistrycharacteristics, together with the morphological findings, were consistent with adiagnosis of leiomyosarcoma. The patient recovered without any concerns afterreceiving routine postoperative care. Clinical examination and abdominalultrasound 5 months postoperatively revealed no abnormalities. Relevance andnovel information: To our knowledge, this is the first report of pancreaticleiomyosarcoma in a cat. Pancreatic leiomyosarcoma should be considered as one ofthe possible differential diagnoses for cats presenting with a pancreatic mass.

PG  - 42
LID - 10.1186/s13567-022-01059-4 [doi]
AB  - This article focuses on the pathogenic significance of Helicobacter speciesnaturally colonizing the stomach of dogs, cats and pigs. These gastric"non-Helicobacter (H.) pylori Helicobacter species" (NHPH) are less well-knownthan the human adapted H. pylori. Helicobacter suis has been associated withgastritis and decreased daily weight gain in pigs. Several studies also attributea role to this pathogen in the development of hyperkeratosis and ulceration ofthe non-glandular stratified squamous epithelium of the pars oesophagea of theporcine stomach. The stomach of dogs and cats can be colonized by severalHelicobacter species but their pathogenic significance for these animals isprobably low. Helicobacter suis as well as several canine and feline gastricHelicobacter species may also infect humans, resulting in gastritis, peptic andduodenal ulcers, and low-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. These agents may be transmitted to humans most likely through direct or indirectcontact with dogs, cats and pigs. Additional possible transmission routes includeconsumption of water and, for H. suis, also consumption of contaminated pork. It has been described that standard H. pylori eradication therapy is usually alsoeffective to eradicate the NHPH in human patients, although acquiredantimicrobial resistance may occasionally occur and porcine H. suis strains areintrinsically less susceptible to aminopenicillins than non-human primate H. suisstrains and other gastric Helicobacter species. Virulence factors of H. suis and the canine and feline gastric Helicobacter species include urease activity,motility, chemotaxis, adhesins and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. These NHPH,however, lack orthologs of cytotoxin-associated gene pathogenicity island andvacuolating cytotoxin A, which are major virulence factors in H. pylori. It canbe concluded that besides H. pylori, gastric Helicobacter species associated withdogs, cats and pigs are also clinically relevant in humans. Although recentresearch has provided better insights regarding pathogenic mechanisms andtreatment strategies, a lot remains to be investigated, including true prevalencerates, exact modes of transmission and molecular pathways underlying diseasedevelopment and progression.

AB  - Feline calicivirus (FCV) causes upper respiratory tract diseases in cats and has highly variable antigenicity for neutralization of each strain. Neutralizingepitopes of FCV are currently found in the hypervariable region (HVR) in the P2domain of the major capsid protein VP1. Due to its unique ability to neutralizevarious FCV strains, 1D7 is a monoclonal antibody that may recognize a novelneutralizing epitope. While other neutralizing epitopes were characterized byproducing neutralization-resistant variants, only 1D7-resistant variants couldnot be obtained, and its epitope has not been identified in the previous studies.In this study, we successfully generated these variants by multiple passaging of the FCV F4 strain in the presence of 1D7 and discovered that several amino acidsubstitutions (K638N, R662G, and T666I in the P1 domain of VP1) are involved inthe decreased binding of 1D7. These substitution sites are also highly conserved among FCV strains compared with the substitution sites of otherneutralization-resistant variants found in the HVR. Our results indicate thatamino acid substitutions in the P1 domain, which are not responsible for directinteraction with the FCV receptor, are associated with neutralization escape.Since FCV can be conveniently cultured in vitro and the receptor required forinfection is known, a detailed analysis of the 1D7 epitope could shed more light on the neutralization mechanism of the epitopes of viruses belonging to theCaliciviridae.

AB  - Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) are drug-oxygenating enzymes that arepresent in the human genome as FMO1-5 and FMO6P. Among pig, dog, and cat FMOs,pig and dog FMO1 and FMO3 have been partly characterized, but other FMOs have notbeen systematically identified. In this study, orthologous FMO cDNAs wereisolated from pig, dog, and cat livers and evaluated by sequence and phylogeneticanalyses, tissue expression, and catalytic function. The amino acid sequences of pig, dog, and cat FMO1-5 shared high sequence identities (83-89%) with humanFMO1-5 and were closely clustered in a phylogenetic tree. The gene structure and genomic organization of FMO1-5 were conserved across these species. Dog and pigFMO6P contained insertions of 1 and 83 bases, respectively, and are possiblypseudogenes similar to human FMO6P. Among the tissue types analyzed, pig FMO1mRNA was abundant in liver, kidney, and lung; dog FMO3, FMO2, and FMO5 mRNAs wereabundant in liver, lung, and kidney, respectively; cat FMO1 and FMO3 mRNAs wereabundant in kidney and liver, respectively. Recombinant pig and dog FMO1-5 andcat FMO1-6 all mediated benzydamine and trimethylamine N-oxygenations and methyl p-tolyl sulfoxide S-oxygenation. The selective human FMO3 substratetrimethylamine was predominantly metabolized by pig FMO1, dog FMO3, and cat FMO3.Cat FMO6 was also active toward trimethylamine. These results suggest somesimilarities in the drug-metabolizing capabilities of FMO3 in dogs, cats, andhumans and that dog and cat FMO3 generally have molecular and functionalcharacteristics similar to human FMO3, being the major FMO in human liver.

AB  - Capromorelin is a ghrelin-receptor agonist widely used as an appetite stimulantin dogs. Capromorelin disrupts glucose homeostasis in cats but informationregarding its effects on canine glucose homeostasis is lacking. The studyobjective was to evaluate the effect of capromorelin on glucose homeostaticmechanisms in healthy dogs. Eight clinically healthy client-owned adult dogs wereenrolled in this prospective, cross-over, placebo-controlled study. Dogs wererandomized to receive capromorelin (Entyce, 3 mg/kg) or placebo, q24h for 3 d. A wk later, treatments were crossed over. Interstitial glucose (IG) concentrations were measured using a flash glucose monitoring system throughout. On d 1 of each treatment, blood glucose (BG), insulin, glucagon, glucose-dependentinsulinotropic peptide (GIP), and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) concentrations were measured before drug administration, then before and 30-120 min afterfeeding a glucose-rich diet (Ensure Plus, 21 kcal/kg). Data were analyzed as a2-period crossover design using generalized least squares estimation.Capromorelin administration increased mean 48 h IG by10% and mean BG by 20% at 90and 120 min post-prandially (P < 0.0001). Post-prandially, there was atime-by-treatment effect for insulin (P = 0.03) and GIP (P = 0.0002) becausecapromorelin doubled geometric mean insulin concentrations at 120 min andincreased geometric mean GIP concentrations more rapidly than after placebo.There were no differences in glucagon or GLP-1 concentrations between treatmentgroups. The increase in post-prandial blood glucose was not the result of overtsuppression of incretin hormone secretion. There was also no suppressive effectof capromorelin on insulin.

AB  - Facial expressions in non-human animals are closely linked to their internalaffective states, with the majority of empirical work focusing on facial shapechanges associated with pain. However, existing tools for facial expressionanalysis are prone to human subjectivity and bias, and in many cases also requirespecial expertise and training. This paper presents the first comparative studyof two different paths towards automatizing pain recognition in facial images of domestic short haired cats (n = 29), captured during ovariohysterectomy atdifferent time points corresponding to varying intensities of pain. One approach is based on convolutional neural networks (ResNet50), while the other-on machine learning models based on geometric landmarks analysis inspired by speciesspecific Facial Action Coding Systems (i.e. catFACS). Both types of approachesreach comparable accuracy of above 72%, indicating their potential usefulness as a basis for automating cat pain detection from images.

AB  - Motor lateralization is commonly observed through preferential paw use in dogsand cats. Previous studies have uncovered sex-related differences in pawpreference, hypothesizing that these differences may be related to sex hormones. The current study aimed to compare neutered and entire individuals to furtherinvestigate whether paw preference is influenced by sex hormones. Dog and catowners were required to fill in a questionnaire with demographic information suchas sex and neuter status of their pets. They then carried out two simple pawpreference tasks within their homes: a "reaching for food" task and a "reachingfor a toy" task. This study revealed an overall preference among the 272 dogs and137 cats tested to use their right paw in both tasks. In cats, the degree of paw preference (i.e., regardless of the direction) was significantly influenced by aninteraction between neuter status and life stage. Also in dogs, both life stageand an interaction between neuter status and life stage tended to influence thedegree of paw preference. Post-hoc power analysis revealed a lack of statistical power, suggesting that future studies using a larger sample size are needed tofurther investigate potential effects of neuter status on paw preference.

AB  - Simulated Physiological Oocyte Maturation (SPOM) mimics in vitro thephysiological events of oocyte maturation. The system uses cAMP modulators in twosteps (pre IVM and IVM) and has presented promising results that are arousing thecuriosity of IVF programs in different animal species, generating several papers,adaptations, and controversies worldwide. This study systematically analyses the data in the literature on the use of SPOM and compares the outcomes to theoriginal paper (Albuz et al. Hum. Rep., 25: 2999-3011 2010), classifying theminto success or failure. The PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases weresearched and 22 studies were included, from which data on 26 experiments wereextracted and evaluated via descriptive statistical analysis. Only experimentsthat assessed the blastocyst rate (BR) were considered for the success parameter,i.e. success (increase in BR) or failure (either no difference or a reduction in BR). The experiments applied the SPOM system in the following species: cattle,sheep, goats, mice, mares and cats. Three experiments (3/26) could not beevaluated for success or failure, and of the remaining, 34.7% (8/23) succeeded inimproving blastocyst production. More than two-thirds (69.2%, 18/26) ofexperiments were conducted in cattle; of those, 86.8% (13/15) used TCM-199 as theIVM media, and 22.2% did not use forskolin or IBMX modulators as indicated in theoriginal study. Also, 27.7% (5/18) of the experiments in cattle used the sametype and dose of FSH, and 22% (4/18) used the same protein source andconcentration as indicated in the original study. All experiments conducted inmice (3) kept the parameters of the original study in terms of forskolin and IBMXdoses and BSA and FSH concentrations, however, they removed cilostamide from IVM.Cilostamide was used during IVM in more than half (53.8%) of all experiments, butonly in cattle and sheep. Considering oocyte and embryo assessments, sixexperiments assessed cAMP levels and most (5/6) of these observed an increase: incattle (2), sheep (2), and mice (1). Ten experiments evaluated the effect of SPOMon nuclear maturation, and in 90% (9/10), the SPOM system was able to arrestmeiosis (cattle, sheep and mice). Thirteen experiments evaluated the total cellnumber (cattle, mice and sheep), and six (6/13) showed an increase. Our findings clearly indicate difficulties in reproducing the SPOM system worldwide,demonstrating that the meiosis arrest is not sufficient to ensure successful SPOMapplication. They also suggest that the different supplements used in the IVMmedium and/or their interaction with modulators for different durations mayproduce a significant bias that affects experimental success.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate dexamethasone intraocular suspension 9% (intraocular DXM) inreal-world clinical use to manage inflammation associated with cataract surgery. Setting: Patients who underwent cataract surgery and received intraocular DXM at 22 outpatient eye surgery centers in the US. Design: Retrospective, observationalchart review. Methods: Records of all patients who received intraocular DXM from March to December 2019 at participating centers were reviewed. Main OutcomeMeasures: Outcomes included anterior chamber cell (ACC) grades, anterior chamber flare (ACF) grades, and visual acuity, as well as intraocular pressure (IOP) and adverse events (AEs) at postoperative days (PODs) 1, 8, 14, 30. Descriptivestatistics were generated. Results: The study population included 527 patients(641 eyes), with glaucoma history in 66 patients (80 eyes). Among eyes withrecorded ACC grades, the percentage with grade 0 increased from 40% at POD 1 to89.7% at POD 30, with similar results in eyes with glaucoma history. Among eyeswith recorded ACF grades, the percentage with grade 0 increased from 78.4% at POD1 to 97.1% at POD 30. At POD 30, 96.6% eyes with recorded results achieved targetacuity. Mean IOP was 18.6 mmHg at POD 1 but declined to </=15.2 mmHg thereafter. Investigators reported 22 AEs in 20 patients, all reported mild or moderate, the most common: IOP increase (7 events). Conclusion: Patients undergoing cataractsurgery and treated with intraocular DXM showed favorable inflammatory and visualoutcomes, without unanticipated safety problems, consistent with results ofprevious controlled clinical trials.

LID - 10.3390/jcm11112975 [doi]
AB  - Blastocystis is an intestinal microeukaryote with ambiguous pathogenicity,commonly detected in human feces worldwide. It comprises at least 28 genetically diverse subtypes (STs), 12 of which also occur in a wide range of animal species,giving rise to suspicion of zoonotic transmission. To investigate this, weconducted a molecular study of 145 stool samples of pet animals, and 67 of their owners, living in an urban area in Poland. Blastocystis was detected in onlythree (2.1%) animal samples (of two bearded agamas and a leopard gecko), whileall dogs, cats, and pet rodents were Blastocystis-negative. Blastocystis was alsopresent in three (4.5%) owners of animals, but they were cat owners, not reptile owners, and the subtypes identified in them differed significantly from those of reptiles. Additionally, the frequency of Blastocystis in different groups of dogs(depending on how they were kept) was analyzed. This work is the first to findBlastocystis in pet reptiles, and we encourage further investigation ofBlastocystis in this poorly examined group of animals, as well as continued studyon the transmission of this microorganism between humans and animals.

LID - 10.3390/ani12111472 [doi]
AB  - Human-animal interactions and the emotional relationship of the owner with thepet are the subjects of many scientific studies and the constant interest of not only scientists but also pet owners. The aim of this study was to determine andcompare the hair cortisol levels of dogs, cats, and their owners living in thesame household. The owners were asked to complete a questionnaire concerning the frequency of their interactions with pets and emotional relationship with each oftheir cats and each of their dogs. The study involved 25 women who owned at leastone dog and at least one cat. In total, 45 dogs and 55 cats from 25 householdsparticipated in the study. The average level of hair cortisol of the owners was4.62 ng/mL, of the dogs 0.26 ng/mL, and in the hair of cats 0.45 ng/mL. There wasno significant correlation between the hair cortisol level of the owner and dogor the owner and the cat and between dogs and cats living together. A significantpositive correlation was observed between the hair cortisol level in the ownerand the pet, for dogs in which the owner performs grooming treatments once a weekand for cats which are never kissed. Although our study did not find manysignificant correlations, studies using other stress markers might have yieldeddifferent results.

LID - 10.3390/ani12111461 [doi]
AB  - Several factors may influence cats' length of stay (LoS) within the shelterenvironment. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential influencethat baby schema (characteristic facial features of infants, related to perceived'cuteness') has on cats' length of stay (LoS) in an animal shelter. Other factorssuch as paired-homing requirements, adoption profile (adverts to encourage theadoption of a specific animal) wording, coat colour, sex and age were alsoexplored. Objective 'cuteness' scores were created by measuring specific facialfeatures of 165 shelter cats. Several proportions of the cats' faces wereexplored to identify the best objective measure of cuteness, including elementswhich have been found to associate with cuteness in cats and humans and newexploratory eye measurements. Subjective cuteness scores were developed byparticipants rating the 'cuteness' of the cat from '1-Not very cute' to'5-Extremely cute' through two online surveys; survey 1 investigated the cats'social nature as well as cuteness while the second only looked at cuteness. Thesubjective cuteness scores were used to validate the objective cuteness scores.The analysis found that subjective cuteness in survey 1 was the only variable of influence on LoS. A novel objective cuteness measurement was developed whichreflects the eye shape associated with subjective cuteness scores. The currentstudy found that cuteness may not be as influential on cats' LoS in shelters ashypothesised. This research looks to understand factors which influence LoS tohelp identify potential methods to reduce time spent in shelters and improve the welfare of cats within these environments.

LID - 1450 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12111450 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this review was to carry out a comprehensive investigation ofthe benefits of incorporating insects as a pet food ingredient and theimplications this can have in determining a market demand for insect-based petfoods. Black soldier fly larvae (Hermetia illucens), mealworm larvae (Tenebriomolitor) and adult house crickets (Acheta domesticus) are currently used in petfood. These insects are widely fed to exotic pets, mainly in whole, live ordehydrated formats. They are also incorporated as meal or fat and are offered to cats and dogs as dry or wet food and treats. Scientific studies about the use of insects for dog and cat feed are scarce. Most studies are in dogs. Research showsthat insect nutrients, mainly amino acids, have high digestibility, arebeneficial to health, do not have any detrimental effect on the gut microbiotaand are accepted by dogs. In several countries, insects are approved for use inpet food and commercialization has spread throughout the world. Pet owners arewilling to try foods made with insect meal for their pets. In conclusion, the useof insects in pet food is a reality that is taking on more and more prominence.

TI  - Companion Animals' Roles for AIDS Survivors, Mostly Aging Males, during HIV/AIDS and COVID-19 Pandemics.
LID - 1449 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12111449 [doi]
AB  - Long-term HIV/AIDS survivors responded online concerning their experiences duringthe AIDS and COVID pandemics. Recruited from web-based organizations for AIDSsurvivors, 147 answered questions on: frequency of experiencing stigma,isolation, aloneness, or grief/sadness; pet ownership; and sources of humansupport during each pandemic. Conditional inference trees were run to identifyrelevant demographic factors. Post-hoc comparisons were conducted to compare dog owners and cat owners. AIDS survivors reported more frequent feelings of stigma, aloneness, and sadness/grief during the AIDS pandemic than during COVID. Catowners' sadness/grief during AIDS was greater than non-owners. During COVID,older respondents unexpectedly were less often sad/grieving than younger ones;dog owners less often felt alone and isolated than non-dog owners. Support duringthe AIDS pandemic retrospectively was rated better for older respondents; younggays' support was greater than young straights. During COVID, support was better for men than women. Contrastingly, women with pets felt less support than thosewithout; men with dogs felt more support than those without. Cat owners moreoften felt isolated and unsupported during COVID than dog owners. Few dog or cat owners received support from family members in either pandemic; during AIDS,family support was better for owners of dogs than cats.

TI  - A Systematic Review of Complementary and Alternative Veterinary Medicine in Sportand Companion Animals: Soft Tissue Mobilization.
LID - 1440 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12111440 [doi]
AB  - Soft tissue mobilization is frequently used in the treatment of sport andcompanion animals. There is, however, uncertainty regarding the efficacy andeffectiveness of these methods. Therefore, the aim of this systematic literature review was to assess the evidence for clinical effects of massage and stretching in cats, dogs, and horses. A bibliographic search, restricted to studies in cats,dogs, and horses, was performed on Web of Science Core Collection, CABI, andPubMed. Relevant articles were assessed for scientific quality, and informationwas extracted on study characteristics, species, type of treatment, indication,and treatment effects. Of 1189 unique publications screened, 11 were eligible forinclusion. The risk of bias was assessed as high in eight of the studies andmoderate in three of the studies, two of the latter indicating a decreased heart rate after massage. There was considerable heterogeneity in reported treatmenteffects. Therefore, the scientific evidence is not strong enough to define theclinical efficacy and effectiveness of massage and stretching in sport andcompanion animals.

TI  - Current State of In Vitro Embryo Production in African Lion (Panthera leo).
LID - 1424 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12111424 [doi]
AB  - In the last 30-40 years, in vitro maturation (IVM) and fertilization (IVF) ofdomestic cat oocytes have been established as part of the panel of assistedreproduction technologies. As a representative of wild felids, the African lionis not yet considered endangered. Nevertheless, the zoo population management of the African lion itself as well as other closely related felids would benefitfrom the establishment of an IVF system. Here, we aimed to investigate thetransferability of domestic cat IVF technology to the African lion. From theovaries of 42 lionesses aged between 0.75 and 15 years, a total of 933IVF-suitable oocytes were retrieved and subjected to IVM and IVF. The overallmaturation rate was 40.6% and 18.9% of these oocytes cleaved after fertilization,respectively. Embryos were generated by intracytoplasmic sperm cell injection as well as co-culture with epididymal sperm. Improvements in the model system alsoled to an improved outcome with in vitro produced embryos in the lion. Comparedto domestic cats, the transportation of gonads to a specialized laboratory wastime-consuming and influenced oocyte quality negatively. In conclusion, thedomestic cat IVF system is adoptable for the African lion, although success ratesare still lower.

TI  - Recognition of Coat Pattern Variation and Broken Tail Phenomenon in the AsiaticGolden Cat (Catopuma temminckii).
LID - 1420 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12111420 [doi]
AB  - The Asian golden cat (Catopuma temminckii) is the most varied wild cat species interms of coat color. Understanding coat pattern variation will help to elucidate the mechanisms behind it as well as its relationship with the environment. Weconducted long-term (2013-2021) monitoring of Asian golden cats in the YarlungZangbo Grand Canyon National Nature Reserve, Tibet, using camera traps at 283points over 89,991 camera days. A total of 620 cat photos were recorded,including 344 (55.48%) with recognizable color patterns. Vector graphics of thecoat patterns were extracted from the field image data, which revealed 10 colortypes in the ratio common: cinnamon: reddish-brown long hair: ocelot: blackening:melanistic: gray: brown: brown short hair: pure black =123:76:57:35:22:8:7:7:5:4. The genes for coat pattern variation are widespread inthe Asian golden cat population and are relatively stable. The increase inpopulation size intraspecific competition has led to the tail break phenotype in individual cats. The gene encoding for tail breakage in Asian golden cats remainsunknown. This study provides basic information for understanding faunal diversityin the Eastern Himalayan biodiversity hotspot and serves as a reference forstudies on the formation mechanisms for feline color pattern diversity.

AB  - Fetal fluid contents have functions in protecting fetuses and are essential forfetal development and maturation. However, little is known about the exactphysiological functions of fetal fluids in fetal development, as well as thechanging composition throughout the gestational period in cats. In this study,the biochemical composition of amniotic (AMN) and allantoic (ALL) fluids wasinvestigated, as well as in the maternal serum of pregnant queens. Eighteenqueens were included in this study and assigned to six different groups, D20,D25, D30, D40, D45 and D60, according to the gestational stage of fetaldevelopment. A total of 44 amniotic and 37 allantoic samples were collected.Fetal fluids contained lesser concentrations of alanine aminotransferase,albumin, cholesterol, triglycerides, creatine kinase, amylase, total protein and globulin than maternal serum. Other variables, such as aspartateaminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase,were in different concentrations at specific stages of gestation when compared tomaternal serum. There were no differences between fetal fluids and maternal serumfor lactate dehydrogenase, urea, lipase or glucose concentrations. There weregreater concentrations of creatinine in amniotic fluid than in allantoic fluid ormaternal serum. Based on the results of this study, fetal fluids do notaccumulate as a result of the simple filtration of maternal blood, but rather,the fetus produces many of these components as a consequence of organ developmentand maturation.

LID - 10.3390/ani12111413 [doi]
AB  - Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, various animal species were foundto be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The close contact that exists between humans and cats warrants special attention to the role of this species.Therefore, a scoping review was performed to obtain a comprehensive overview ofthe existing literature, and to map key concepts, types of research, and possiblegaps in the research. A systematic search of the databases PubMed, GoogleScholar, and Scopus and the preprint servers medRxiv and bioRxiv was performed.After a two-step screening process, 27 peer-reviewed articles, 8 scientificcommunication items, and 2 unpublished pre-prints were included. The main themes discussed were susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, induced immunity, prevalence ofinfection, manifestation of infection, interspecies transmission between humansand cats, and lastly, intraspecies transmission between cats. The main gaps inthe research identified were a lack of large-scale studies, underrepresentationof stray, feral, and shelter cat populations, lack of investigation intocat-to-cat transmissions under non-experimental conditions, and the relation ofcats to other animal species regarding SARS-CoV-2. Overall, cats seemingly play alimited role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2. While cats are susceptible to the virusand reverse zoonotic transmission from humans to cats happens regularly, there iscurrently no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 circulation among cats.

LID - 10.3390/ani12111390 [doi]
AB  - Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum belong to the Apicomplexan protozoa which is an obligate intracellular parasite, causing toxoplasmosis and neosporosisthroughout the world. Cats and dogs are the definitive hosts of these twoparasites. However, information on the epidemiology of toxoplasmosis andneosporosis in stray cats and dogs in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau Area (QTPA) is limited, and little is known about the diversity of the diseases. Therefore, the aim of this study was to perform indirect ELISA tests based on recombinantTgSAG1, TgGRA1, NcSAG1 and NcGRA7 proteins to establish a detailed record of the seroprevalence of T. gondii and N. caninum-specific IgG and IgM antibodies inserum samples and to develop qPCR amplification based on TgB1 and NcNc5 genes to conduct molecular epidemiology in feces from stray cats and dogs in the QTPA. In the current study, a total of 128 cat serum samples were analyzed throughserological tests in which 53 (41.4%) and 57 (44.5%) samples were found positive for T. gondii specific-IgG and IgM antibodies, and 2 (1.6%) and 74 (57.8%)samples were confirmed positive for N. caninum specific-IgG and IgM antibodies,respectively. Out of 224 stray dog sera, 59.8% and 58.9% were recorded aspositive against anti-Toxoplasma IgG and IgM antibodies, 17.9% and 64.7% weredetected positive against Neospora IgG and IgM. On the other hand, 1 of 18 catfecal samples was successfully amplified within the Ct value of 10 to 30 while nocat was positive for neosporosis. Moreover, a higher prevalence of toxoplasmosis in stray dogs (14.5%, 16/110) than of neosporosis (5.5%, 6/110) with differentparasite numbers were found. Further analysis showed that no significant sexdifferences were found nor between the overall infection rates of T. gondii andN. caninum in this study. This study suggests that stray cats and dogs play keyroles in the transmission and prevalence of T. gondii and N. caninum in theplateau area.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess factors like litter, individual andmaternal effects on kitten overweight at 8 months of age, defined as bodycondition score (BCS) >/= 6, in an intact cat family. To minimize confounding, a homogenized cat population was used. After categorization of the life weight dataaccording to the kittens' sex, BCS and maternal non-pregnant phenotype(overweight (OM), lean (LM), variable (VM)), analyses including Pearson'scorrelation coefficients, two-way ANOVA, linear, linear broken-line regressionand repeated measures mixed model analyses were performed. Overweight and OMkittens gained weight most quickly, and females reached their peak weight earlierthan males (6.2 +/- 0.6 vs. 7.4 +/- 0.2 months). In females but not in males the age to reach peak weight differed markedly according to category. Male (5.82 +/- 0.09, p &lt; 0.01) and OM kittens' (5.80 +/- 0.11, p = 0.07) BCS at 8 months was higher and they were heavier than their counterparts, from 3 and 5 monthsonwards, respectively. Litter size negatively correlated with overweight (r =-0.30, p &lt; 0.01) and birthweight showed a positive correlation to live weight (R(2) = 0.05, p = 0.05) and monthly weight gain (R(2) = 0.18, p &lt; 0.01) overtime. This study supports routine monitoring of birthweight, growth rate andmaternal phenotype prior to pregnancy to identify kittens at risk for becomingoverweight.

AB  - This study evaluated the humoral and cellular response in 100 cats living in anendemic area of visceral leishmaniosis (VL) using the Montenegro Skin Test (MST) and serological diagnosis and compared the MST with other diagnostic techniques. Sixty 60%, (60/100) cats were positive for MST and the diameter of positive skin reactions ranged from 5 to 9 mm. By serological methods, 74% (74/100) and 34%(34/100) had antibodies against Leishmania spp. by Immunofluorescence AntibodyTest (IFAT) and Indirect Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), respectively.Comparing tests, the observed profiles were (1) IFAT (+)/MST (-) = 27 cats, (2)IFAT(-)/MST(+) = 13 cats, (3) IFAT(+)/MST(+) = 47 cats, (4) ELISA(+)/MST(-) = 12 cats, (5) ELISA(-)/MST(+) = 38 cats and (6) ELISA(+)/MST(+) = 22 cats. Throughthe combination of serological diagnosis and MST, a positivity frequency of 87%(87/100) by IFAT + MST and 72% (72/100) by ELISA + MST was identified in this catpopulation. Five cats (5%) were positive for Leishmania donovani complex DNA bymolecular analysis, and two cats (2%) had Leishmania spp. amastigotes in lymphnode smears. Therefore, the agreement between tests was classified as poor forall tests by Kappa index. The IFAT (+)/MST (+) response was the most frequentconsidering all cats (47%; 47/100); nonetheless, the most frequent immuneexpression in Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-positive cats was the IFAT (+)/MST (-) profile (80%; 4/5). Five sick and PCR-positive cats, negative for FelineImmunodeficiency Virus (FIV) and Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV), that PCRsequencing matched 100% with L. donovani complex, all but one were MST negative. These results suggest that cats develop a significant cellular response againstinfection by parasites of the L. donovani complex, and most PCR andparasitological positive cats may be unable to develop a significant cellularresponse.

PG  - e0269682
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0269682 [doi]
AB  - Two-sided mobility platforms, such as Uber and Lyft, widely emerged in the urban mobility landscape. Distributed supply of individual drivers, matched withtravellers via intermediate platform yields a new class of phenomena not present in urban mobility before. Such disruptive changes to transportation systems call for a simulation framework where researchers from various and across disciplines may introduce models aimed at representing the complex dynamics ofplatform-driven urban mobility. In this work, we present MaaSSim, a lightweightagent-based simulator reproducing the transport system used by two kinds ofagents: (i) travellers, requesting to travel from their origin to destination at a given time, and (ii) drivers supplying their travel needs by offering themrides. An intermediate agent, the platform, matches demand with supply. Agentsare individual decision-makers. Specifically, travellers may decide which modethey use or reject an incoming offer; drivers may opt-out from the system orreject incoming requests. All of the above behaviours are modelled throughuser-defined modules, allowing to represent agents' taste variations(heterogeneity), their previous experiences (learning) and available information (system control). MaaSSim is a flexible open-source python library capable ofrealistically reproducing complex interactions between agents of a two-sidedmobility platform. MaaSSim is available from a public repository, along with aset of tutorials and reproducible use-case scenarios, as demonstrated with aseries of illustrative examples and a comprehensive case study.

AB  - Doublecortin (DCX) and neuronal nuclear protein (NeuN) can be used asimmunomarkers of neuronal progenitor cells and mature neurons, respectively.Increased DCX immunolabeling has been associated with tumor invasion in humangliomas and anaplastic canine meningiomas. These immunomarkers have not beenassessed in feline gliomas. Here we characterized the DCX and NeuNimmunohistochemistry (IHC) profile in 11 feline gliomas (7 oligodendrogliomas, 4 astrocytomas). Immunolabeling was classified according to intensity (weak,moderate, strong), distribution of neoplastic cell immunolabeling (1 = <30%, 2 = 30-70%, 3 = >70%), and predominant location within the neoplasm (random or attumor margins). DCX immunolabeling was strong in 6 cases, weak in 4 cases, andmoderate in 1 case. The distribution of DCX immunolabeling was characterized as 1(4 cases), 2 (4 cases), and 3 (3 cases). DCX immunolabeling occurredpredominantly in astrocytomas, which had stronger immunostaining at the tumormargins. NeuN immunolabeling was absent in all cases. Our IHC findings aresimilar to those reported for DCX and NeuN IHC in canine gliomas. The increasedDCX immunolabeling at tumor margins is similar to labeling in invasive humangliomas and anaplastic canine meningiomas.

AB  - Relapsing fever group Borrelia (RFGB) are motile spirochetes transmitted tomammalian or avian hosts through the bite of hematophagous arthropods, such assoft ticks (Argasidae), hard ticks (Ixodidae) and the human clothing lice. RFGBcan infect pets such as dogs and cats, as well as birds, cattle and humans.Borrelia recurrentis, B. anserina and B. theileri are considered to haveworldwide distribution, affecting humans, domestic birds and ruminants,respectively. Borrelia spp. associated with soft ticks are transmitted mainly by Ornithodoros ticks and thrive in endemic foci in tropical and subtropicallatitudes. Nowadays, human cases of soft tick-borne relapsing fever remainneglected diseases in several countries, and the impact these spirochetes have onthe health of wild and domestic animals is largely understudied. Human infection with RFGB is difficult to diagnose, given the lack of distinguishing clinicalfeatures (undifferentiated febrile illness). Clinically, soft tick or louse-bornerelapsing fever is often confused with other etiologies, such as malaria, typhoidor dengue. In Latin America, during the first half of the twentieth centuryhistorical documents elaborated by enlightened physicians were seminal, andresulted in the identification of RFGB and their associated vectors in countries such as Mexico, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru and Argentina. Almost 80 years later, research on relapsing fever spirochetes is emerging once again in LatinAmerica, with molecular characterizations and isolations of novel RFGB members inPanama, Bolivia, Brazil and Chile. In this review we summarize historical aspectsof RFGB in Latin America and provide an update on the current scenario regarding these pathogens in the region. To accomplish this, we conducted an exhaustivesearch of all the published literature for the region, including old medicaltheses deposited in libraries of medical academies. RFGB were once commonpathogens in Latin America, and although unnoticed for many years, they arecurrently the focus of interest among the scientific community. A One Healthperspective should be adopted to tackle the diseases caused by RFGB, since these spirochetes have never disappeared and the maladies they cause may be confusedwith etiologies with similar symptoms that prevail in the region.

AB  - Although sporotrichosis requires a broad approach for control, few reports havedescribed the relationship between the index case and secondary contacts. In the present work, we report an outbreak involving a woman, a dog, and two cats fromthe same household environment, including the clinical and epidemiologicalaspects and outcomes, and discuss the importance of a One Health approach to facethis neglected disease. The joint efforts of professionals such as veterinarians and physicians are essential for early diagnosis and surveillance, whichcontributes to the rapid identification and control of zoonotic sporotrichosisoutbreaks.

TI  - Comparison of corneal culture results obtained using the ESwab and Amies charcoalswab in canine and feline patients.
LID - 10.1111/vop.12999 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to compare corneal culture resultsusing the ESwab and Amies charcoal swab. ANIMALS STUDIED: One hundred fourteencanine and fifteen feline eyes. PROCEDURES: Retrospective analysis of Dick White Referrals bacterial and fungal corneal culture data was conducted. Results wereincluded from canine and feline patients, which presented with suspectedinfectious keratitis that had samples taken using an Amies charcoal swab followedby an ESwab in the same eye. In respect to positive and negative cultures, aMcNemar test was conducted comparing instances of disagreement between swabtypes, and the Kappa coefficient (kappa) was calculated to assess the level ofagreement between swab types. RESULTS: The ESwab produced more positive cornealcultures (71/129 [55.0%]) than the Amies charcoal swab (41/129 [31.8%]). 2/129eyes produced positive fungal cultures. Considering 37/129 eyes in which bothswab types detected a positive corneal culture, the same bacterial species werecultured from each swab type in 34/37 (91.9%) eyes, and an additional bacterialspecies was cultured by the ESwab in 3/37 (8.1%) eyes. In 34/38 (89.5%),instances of disagreement between swab types, the ESwab showed a positiveculture, and the Amies charcoal swab showed a negative culture from the same eye,and this difference was significant (p < 0.0001). There was a moderate level ofagreement between results from both swab types (kappa = 0.432). CONCLUSIONS:ESwab sampling alone may be superior to Amies charcoal swabs for detectingpresence of bacteria in suspected infectious keratitis in cats and dogs.

TI  - Temporal Pitch Sensitivity in an Animal Model: Psychophysics and Scalp Recordings: Temporal Pitch Sensitivity in Cat.
LID - 10.1007/s10162-022-00849-z [doi]
AB  - Cochlear implant (CI) users show limited sensitivity to the temporal pitchconveyed by electric stimulation, contributing to impaired perception of musicand of speech in noise. Neurophysiological studies in cats suggest that thislimitation is due, in part, to poor transmission of the temporal fine structure(TFS) by the brainstem pathways that are activated by electrical cochlearstimulation. It remains unknown, however, how that neural limit might influenceperception in the same animal model. For that reason, we developed non-invasivepsychophysical and electrophysiological measures of temporal (i.e., non-spectral)pitch processing in the cat. Normal-hearing (NH) cats were presented withacoustic pulse trains consisting of band-limited harmonic complexes thatsimulated CI stimulation of the basal cochlea while removing cochlearplace-of-excitation cues. In the psychophysical procedure, trained cats detected changes from a base pulse rate to a higher pulse rate. In the scalp-recordingprocedure, the cortical-evoked acoustic change complex (ACC) andbrainstem-generated frequency following response (FFR) were recordedsimultaneously in sedated cats for pulse trains that alternated between the base and higher rates. The range of perceptual sensitivity to temporal pitch broadlyresembled that of humans but was shifted to somewhat higher rates. The ACClargely paralleled these perceptual patterns, validating its use as an objective measure of temporal pitch sensitivity. The phase-locked FFR, in contrast, showed strong brainstem encoding for all tested pulse rates. These measures demonstrate the cat's perceptual sensitivity to pitch in the absence of cochlear-place cuesand may be valuable for evaluating neural mechanisms of temporal pitch perceptionin the feline animal model of stimulation by a CI or novel auditory prostheses.

AB  - Companion animals are in close contact with the human surroundings, and there is growing concern about the effects of harmful substances on the health of petcats. In this study, we investigated the potential health effects oforganohalogen compounds (OHCs) on thyroid hormone (TH) homeostasis andmetabolomics in Japanese pet cats. There was a significant negative correlationbetween concentrations of several contaminants, such as polychlorinated biphenyls(PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hydroxylated PCBs (OH-PCBs),hydroxylated PBDEs (OH-PBDEs), and THs in cat serum samples. These resultssuggested that exposure to OHCs causes a decrease in serum TH levels in pet cats.In this metabolomics study, each exposure level of parent compounds (PCBs andPBDEs) and their hydroxylated compounds (OH-PCBs and OH-PBDEs) were associatedwith their own unique primary metabolic pathways, suggesting that parent andphenolic compounds exhibit different mechanisms of action and biological effects.PCBs were associated with many metabolic pathways, including glutathione andpurine metabolism, and the effects were replicated in in-vivo cat PCBadministration studies. These results demonstrated that OHC exposure causeschronic oxidative stress in pet cats. PBDEs were positively associated withalanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism. Due to the chronic exposure of catsto mixtures of these contaminants, the combination of their respective metabolic pathways may have a synergistic effect.

AB  - Of the numerous animal species affected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, cats are one of the most susceptible, and cat-to-cat transmission has been described. Althoughcat-to-human infection has not, as yet, been demonstrated, preventive measuresshould be taken in order to avoid both viral infection in cats and transmissionamong them. In this respect, the application of an effective vaccine to at-riskpopulations would be a useful tool for controlling the disease in this species.Here, we test a new vaccine prototype based on the Spike protein of the virus in order to prevent infection and infectious virus shedding in cats. The vaccineemployed in experimentation, and which is easily produced, triggered a strongneutralizing antibody response in vaccinated animals. In contrast to that whichoccurred with control animals, no infectious virus was detected in theoropharyngeal or rectal swabs of vaccinated cats submitted to a SARS-CoV-2challenge. These results are of great interest as regards future considerationsrelated to implementing vaccination programs in pets. The value of cats asvaccination trial models is also described herein.

LID - 10.3389/fped.2022.848357 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the prevalence and distribution of sensitization toaeroallergens in children with atopic diseases. Methods: We conducted skin prick test on 9,527 pediatric patients (aged 0-17 years) with atopic diseases inallergy department of Children's Hospital affiliated with the Capital Instituteof Pediatrics. Positive rates of aeroallergens were compared among the different groups. Results: Boys (69.5%) had a higher positive rate in SPT results thangirls (59.8%; chi(2) = 91.7, P < 0.01), and the prevalence of sensitization toaeroallergens increased from 56.1% in the 0-5 year group, to 73.0% in patientsabove 12 years. Japanese hop (36.2%) and D. farinae (28.1%) were the most common outdoor and indoor aeroallergens, respectively. From low to high age groups, the positive detection rates of D. farinae were 20.3, 30.6, and 33.5%, respectively, followed by D. pteronyssinus (15.7, 24.8, and 30.0%) and cat dander (8.6, 19.8,and 27.9%, respectively), while dog dander and cockroach showed the same trend.The top three positive detection rates of outdoor aeroallergens were Alternaria(30.9%), Japanese Hop (26.7%), and Artemisia (23.7%) in the preschool age group. With regard to patients aged 6 to 11 years, the three most common were Japanesehop (39.2%), Alternaria (36.4%), and Fraxinus pollen (34.4%). Japanese hop(43.8%), Sabina (41.1%), and birch pollen (39.6%) became increasingly commonallergens among adolescents. There were more patients with strongly positivereactions to Alternaria in AS (chi(2) = 10.2, P < 0.01) and AS with AR groups(chi(2) =9.7, P < 0.01) than those in the AR group. Asthmatic patients hadsignificantly higher multiple positive reactions than those with AR (P < 0.01).Asthmatic patients had a much higher prevalence of HDM, animal dander, andAlternaria than those with allergic rhinitis (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Theprevalence of sensitization to aeroallergens increased with age in children with atopic diseases in Greater Beijing Region. Alternaria was the predominantallergen before 5 years of age, and tree pollen had delayed sensitization inadolescents. Sensitization to perennial allergens such as HDM, cats, andAlternaria was more strongly associated with asthma risk. Sensitization to morethan one allergen significantly affected asthmatic patients.

PG  - 900371
LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.900371 [doi]
AB  - Feline heartworm is a vector-borne zoonotic disease caused by Dirofilariaimmitis. It is a cosmopolitan disease that is continuously expanding. Spain isconsidered an endemic country; however, although there are many published studiesin dogs, feline heartworm has been poorly studied in this country. Thus, theobjective was to analyze the exposure to D. immitis throughout Spain to complete the epidemiological map in the feline species. For this, 6,588 feline serumsamples were analyzed for the presence of D. immitis antigens and antibodiesagainst D. immitis and Wolbachia. The results were analyzed according to sex,age, breed, habitat, origin (owned or shelter cats), presence of clinical signs, use of preventive, location and climatology. The results showed a prevalence of0.5% and a seroprevalence of 9.4%. The highest antibody seroprevalences werereported in the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands (19.2 and 16%,respectively), as well as in the autonomous communities located on theMediterranean coast (9.2-11.2%). Seropositive cats were found in both indoor and outdoor cats, and from 6 months of age. Furthermore, only 5.8% of cats receivedregular prophylactic treatment. The results show that feline dirofilariasis iswidely distributed throughout the national territory and corroborate that, where infected dogs are present, there are cats exposed to the parasite. It isnecessary to implement efficient awareness and prophylaxis measures to controlthe incidence and expansion of feline heartworm in Spain.

AB  - There is a paucity of information on the clinical course and outcome of youngcats with polyneuropathy. The aim of the study was to describe the clinicalfeatures, diagnostic investigations, and outcome of a large cohort of cats withinflammatory polyneuropathy from several European countries. Seventy cats withinflammatory infiltrates in intramuscular nerves and/or peripheral nerve biopsieswere retrospectively included. Information from medical records and follow upwere acquired via questionnaires filled by veterinary neurologists who hadsubmitted muscle and nerve biopsies (2011-2019). Median age at onset was 10months (range: 4-120 months). The most common breed was British short hair(25.7%), followed by Domestic short hair (24.3%), Bengal cat (11.4%), Maine Coon (8.6%) and Persian cat (5.7%), and 14 other breeds. Male cats were predominantly affected (64.3%). Clinical signs were weakness (98.6%) and tetraparesis (75.7%)in association with decreased withdrawal reflexes (83.6%) and, less commonly,cranial nerve signs (17.1%), spinal pain/hyperesthesia (12.9%), andmicturition/defecation problems (14.3%). Onset was sudden (30.1%) or insidious(69.1%), and an initial progressive phase was reported in 74.3%. Characteristicfindings on electrodiagnostic examination were presence of generalizedspontaneous electric muscle activity (89.6%), decreased motor nerve conductionvelocity (52.3%), abnormal F-wave studies (72.4%), pattern of temporal dispersion(26.1%) and unremarkable sensory tests. The clinical course was mainly described as remittent (49.2%) or remittent-relapsing (34.9%), while stagnation,progressive course or waxing and waning were less frequently reported. Relapseswere common and occurred in 35.7% of the cats' population. An overall favorableoutcome was reported in 79.4% of patients. In conclusion, young age at the timeof diagnosis and sudden onset of clinical signs were significantly associatedwith recovery (p < 0.05). Clinical and electrodiagnostic features and theremittent-relapsing clinical course resembles juvenile chronic inflammatorydemyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), as seen in human (children/adolescents), in many aspects.

AB  - Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) is an ocular disease characterized bycongenital anterior segmental maldevelopment with progressive optic nervedegeneration. Certain genes, such as cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily B member 1 and latent TGF-beta-binding protein 2, are involved in the pathogenesis of PCG,but the exact pathogenic mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated. There is anurgent need to determine the etiology and pathophysiology of PCG and develop new therapeutic methods to stop disease progression. Animal models can simulate PCGand are essential to study the pathogenesis and treatment of PCG. Various animal species have been used in the study of PCG, including rabbits, rats, mice, cats, zebrafish, and quails. These models are formed spontaneously or by combining withgenetic engineering technology. The focus of the present study is to review thecharacteristics and potential applications of animal models in PCG and providenew approaches to understand the mechanism and develop new treatment strategiesfor patients with PCG.

TI  - A retrospective analysis of the concordance of in-house fungal culture and acommercial quantitative PCR from 16 dermatology referral practices across the USA(2018-2019).
LID - 10.1111/vde.13085 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Commercial quantitative (q)PCR and fungal culture can be usedconcurrently or individually to test for dermatophytosis with a reported highsensitivity and specificity. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: The aims of thisretrospective study were: (i) to evaluate the concordance of a commercial qPCRwith in-house fungal culture for the initial diagnosis of dermatophytosis and formonitoring for mycological cure during treatment in dermatology private practice;and (ii) determine the sensitivity and specificity of qPCR overall, (iii) forinitial diagnosis and (iv) for treatment monitoring in dogs and cats. ANIMALS:Four-hundred and twenty-seven client-owned dogs and 188 client-owned cats.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective evaluation of electronic medical recordsfrom 615 client-owned dogs and cats presented to 16 dermatology referralpractices across the USA from 2018 to 2019. Concordance of qPCR with in-housefungal culture and sensitivity and specificity were determined from 667 pairedsamples. RESULTS: qPCR agreed with in-house fungal culture in 63 of 85 positivetests and 571 of 582 negative tests, with an overall sensitivity and specificity of 74.1% [95% confidence interval (CI) 63.5-83.0] and 98.1% (95%CI 96.6-99.0),respectively. qPCR sensitivity and specificity for the initial diagnosis ofdermatophytosis and for treatment monitoring were 72.4% (95%CI 59.1-83.3) and98.7% (95%CI 97.3-99.5), and 77.8% (95%CI 57.7-91.4) and 92.0% (95%CI 80.1-97.8),respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Compared to in-house fungalculture, qPCR was less sensitive and more specific than reported previously.These findings suggest that a diagnosis of dermatophytosis and determiningmycological cure should continue to be based on a combination of complementarydiagnostic tests.

LID - 10.1002/vetr.1738 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There has been increasing provision of veterinary telemedicineconsultations, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, littleevidence currently exists examining these remote consultations. The aim of thiscross-sectional study was to explore veterinary and cat owner experiences oftelemedicine consultations during the pandemic. METHODS: Two questionnaires, one aimed at veterinary professionals and one at cat owners, were launched inSeptember 2020. Questions explored the type of consultation conducted remotely,the perceived advantages and disadvantages of telemedicine, and the role oftelemedicine in the future of veterinary practice. RESULTS: Responses werereceived from 242 veterinary professionals and 98 owners with experience oftelemedicine. Monitoring and advice consultations were felt to be most suited to telemedicine. Reduced stress for owners/cats was seen as an advantage oftelemedicine, while lack of clinical examination and risk of misdiagnosis wereviewed as disadvantages. Most respondents (85.7% [n = 84/98] of owners; 67.4% [n = 163/242] of veterinary professionals) felt practices should continue to offertelemedicine consultations. CONCLUSION: With increasing pet ownership andpractice workload, telemedicine may play a crucial role in the future ofveterinary practice. Future work should focus on a strategic approach to felinetelemedicine, integrating it alongside face-to-face visits and developingtechnologies to maximise its advantages.

AB  - Pulmonary hemorrhage (P-Hem) occurs among multiple species and can have variouscauses. Cytology of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) using a 5-tier scoringsystem of alveolar macrophages based on their hemosiderin content is consideredthe most sensitive diagnostic method. We introduce a novel, fully annotatedmulti-species P-Hem dataset, which consists of 74 cytology whole slide images(WSIs) with equine, feline and human samples. To create this high-quality andhigh-quantity dataset, we developed an annotation pipeline combining humanexpertise with deep learning and data visualisation techniques. We applied a deeplearning-based object detection approach trained on 17 expertly annotated equine WSIs, to the remaining 39 equine, 12 human and 7 feline WSIs. The resultingannotations were semi-automatically screened for errors on multiple types ofspecialised annotation maps and finally reviewed by a trained pathologist. Ourdataset contains a total of 297,383 hemosiderophages classified into five grades.It is one of the largest publicly available WSIs datasets with respect to thenumber of annotations, the scanned area and the number of species covered.

AB  - PURPOSE: Measuring the growth of young children's vocabulary is important forresearchers seeking to understand language learning as well as for cliniciansaiming to identify early deficits. The MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (CDIs) are parent report instruments that offer a reliable and valid method for measuring early productive and receptive vocabulary across a number oflanguages. CDI forms typically include hundreds of words, however, and so theburden of completion is significant. We address this limitation by building onprevious work using item response theory (IRT) models to create computer adaptivetest (CAT) versions of the CDIs. We created CDI-CATs for both comprehension andproduction vocabulary, for both American English and Mexican Spanish. METHOD:Using a data set of 7,633 English-speaking children ages 12-36 months and 1,692Spanish-speaking children ages 12-30 months, across three CDI forms (Words &Gestures, Words & Sentences, and CDI-III), we found that a 2-parameter logisticIRT model fits well for a majority of the 680 pooled vocabulary items. Weconducted CAT simulations on this data set, assessing simulated tests of varying length (25-400 items). RESULTS: Even very short CATs recovered participantabilities very well with little bias across ages. An empirical validation studywith N = 204 children ages 15-36 months showed a correlation of r = .92 betweenlanguage ability estimated from full CDI versus CDI-CAT forms. CONCLUSION: Weprovide our item bank along with fitted parameters and other details, offerrecommendations for how to construct CDI-CATs in new languages, and suggest when this type of assessment may or may not be appropriate.

TI  - Escherichia coli sequence type 73 bloodstream infections in a centralizedCanadian region and their association with companion animals: an ecologicalstudy.
LID - 10.1007/s15010-022-01856-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) are important pathogenscausing community-acquired infections in humans, including bloodstream infections(BSIs), and may also colonize and infect animals. Our aim was to investigateassociations between incidence rates (IRs) of BSIs caused by ExPEC and number of dogs and cats in communities in Calgary. METHODS: We used a well-characterizedcollection of blood isolates (n = 685) from Calgary, Alberta, Canada (2016). Weused a combination of a seven-single-nucleotide-polymorphism quantitative PCR to type ExPEC into sequence types (STs). Calgary census data were used to estimateIRs per city community, as well as to investigate associations between number of companion animals per community, as obtained from licensing data, and IR of BSIs caused by each dominant ST. RESULTS: From the 685 isolates available, ExPEC ST131was most prevalent (21.3% of included isolates), followed by ST73 (13.7%), ST69(8.2%), ST95 (6.7%), and ST1193 (5.3%), respectively. Incidence of BSIs caused byExPECs among Calgary residents was 48.8 cases per 100,000 resident-years, whereascommunities had on average of 1.7 companion animals per 10 residents. Noassociation between the number of dogs and IR of BSIs caused by ExPECs wasdetected for any ST. Conversely, the incidence rate of BSIs caused by ST73 was3.6 times higher (95%CI 1.3-9.99) for every increase of 1 cat per 10 habitants incommunities. CONCLUSIONS: Number of cats per habitant was positively associatedwith the incidence of BSIs caused by ExPEC ST73.

TI  - Is training necessary for efficacious use of the Glasgow Feline Composite MeasurePain Scale?
PG  - 609-616
AB  - Objective: The Glasgow Feline Composite Measure Pain Scale (CMPS-F) is avalidated cat pain assessment tool for clinical use. No research has examined howtraining impacts use of this tool. Thus, we examined whether seminar-styletraining improves the identification of cat pain when using the CMPS-F.Veterinarians (n = 17) and non-veterinarian staff (n = 33; N = 50) were recruitedto participate. Procedure: Seminars included: i) pre-training use of the CMPS-Fto score cat videos with varying degrees of pain; ii) cat pain assessmenttraining; and iii) post-training use of the CMPS-F. Participant CMPS-F ratingswere compared to experts' ratings of the same videos. Average CMPS-F scores andanalgesic decision ratings were compared pre-and post-training. Results: Mostparticipants were female non-veterinarian staff who had not heard of the CMPS-F. Participant and expert analgesic decision-making did not differ pre- (P = 1.0)and post-training (P = 0.1). In addition, analgesic decision-making was similarbetween participants and experts for all but 3/20 videos. Conclusion and clinicalrelevance: Seminar training may not be necessary for efficacious use of theCMPS-F. Further research is needed to explore strategies for improving awareness of cat pain assessment tools and increasing in-clinic use.

TI  - Description and validation of a new descriptive and multiparametric numericrating scale to assess sedation in cats.
PG  - 603-608
AB  - The objective of this study was to design and assess the validity and reliabilityof a new feline multiparametric sedation scale (FMSS). A total of 89 householdcats were recruited, enabling a total of 534 sedation assessments. Everyassessment was performed by 3 blinded observers with varying expertise levels(Level 1: Student; Level 2: RVT; Level 3: ACVAA diplomate or senior resident).For comparison purposes, a visual analogue scale (VAS) and a Simple QualitativeScale (SQS) were also used concurrently, with the VAS considered the goldstandard. The new scale had excellent inter-observer agreement among experiencegroups with weighted Kappa scores of 0.84 (Levels 1 versus 2), 0.82 (Levels 2versus 3), and 0.84 (Levels 1 versus 3), with P < 0.0001 for all comparisons.There was a high degree of association between FMSS and VAS (r = 0.90, P <0.0001) and between FMSS and SQS (r = 0.89, P < 0.0001). Final FMSS numericalvalues were paired with levels of sedation with None = 0 (0 to 5), Mild = 4 (1 to7), Moderate = 6 (2 to 10), and Profound = 12 (7 to 12); furthermore, differenceswere detected between pre- and post-sedation evaluations (P = 0.001). This scale demonstrated internal consistency and sensitivity even when evaluating drugs ordoses with minimal sedative effects and there was very strong interraterreliability, independent of experience level. Based on this clinical study, weconcluded that the use of this sedation scale is appropriate when objectivenumerical sedation quantification is required, in either a clinical or researchsetting.

TI  - Comparison of Three Tonometers in Measuring Intraocular Pressure in Eyes ThatUnderwent Myopic Laser in situ Keratomileusis and Photorefractive Keratectomy.
PG  - 1623-1637
LID - 10.2147/OPTH.S362344 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To compare the intraocular pressure (IOP) obtained by Goldmannapplanation tonometer (GAT), correcting applanation tonometer surface (CATS) and biomechanically corrected IOP (bIOP) of Corvis ST tonometer (CVS); and todetermine the effects of manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE), centralcorneal thickness (CCT) and mean corneal curvature (Km) on the IOP measurementsof corneal refractive patients. Methods: This was a single-center, retrospective,cross-sectional study of 120 eyes of 64 patients from May 1, 2020 to June 1, 2021who underwent laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) or photorefractive keratectomy(PRK). The level of agreement between the three tonometers was evaluated, andcorrelation between parameters was calculated using Pearson correlation. Results:Mean preoperative to postoperative IOP in LASIK and PRK was 15.1 +/- 3 to 11.3+/- 2.1 and 14.4 +/- 2.6 to 12.1 +/- 3 using GAT, 16.4 +/- 2.8 to 13.1 +/- 2.3and 15.9 +/- 2.6 to 13.7 +/- 3 using CATS and 14.8 +/- 2.4 to 12.9 +/- 1.5 and14.2 +/- 2.4 to 12.6 +/- 1.9 using CVS-bIOP. Preoperative IOP correlation betweeneach tonometer pair showed that the lowest mean difference was between GAT andCVS-bIOP (0.32 in LASIK, 0.15 in PRK). Preoperative to postoperative IOPcorrelation of each tonometer resulted in a difference of 3.77, 2.30 in GAT;3.32, 2.28 in CATS and 1.88, 1.62 in CVS-bIOP in the LASIK and PRK groups,respectively. Percentage change in CCT and Km was not correlated while change in MRSE had a weak relationship with percentage change in CVS-bIOP. Conclusion:Preoperatively, GAT and CVS-bIOP had the best agreement in IOP measurements. CATSrecorded the highest IOP preoperatively and postoperatively. IOP decreased in thethree tonometers after LASIK and PRK with GAT having the largest decrease.CVS-bIOP had the lowest change between preoperative and postoperative IOPmeasurements. Only percentage change in MRSE was correlated with percentagechange in CVS-bIOP in the LASIK group.

AB  - The endothelial glycocalyx (eGlx) is a critically important structure lining the luminal surface of endothelial cells. There is increasing evidence, in humanpatients and animal models, for its crucial role in the maintenance of health.Moreover, its damage is associated with the pathogenesis of multiple diseasestates. This review provides readers with an overview of the eGlx; summarisingits structure, essential functions, and evidence for its role in disease. Wehighlight the lack of studies regarding the eGlx in cats and dogs, particularlyin naturally occurring diseases. Importantly, we discuss techniques to aid itsstudy, which can be applied to veterinary species. Finally, we present targetedtherapies aimed at preserving, and in some cases, restoring damaged eGlx.

TI  - Mesenteric lymph node abscesses due to Escherichia coli in a cat.
PG  - 1611-1616
LID - 10.1002/vms3.840 [doi]
AB  - A 3-year-old, castrated male mixed-breed cat presented with an almost 2-yearhistory of chronic loose stools. On radiography and ultrasound examination, therewere two masses in the centre of the abdomen. Contrast-enhanced computedtomography revealed that the masses were enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes withfluid accumulation. Percutaneous lesion drainage yielded pus-like fluid. Fluidcytology revealed numerous neutrophils and Gram-negative rods. Pus cultureidentified Escherichia coli as the causative organism. Consequently, mesentericlymph node abscesses were definitively diagnosed. Since computed tomographyshowed that the abscesses adhered to the surrounding tissues, it was difficult toremove them surgically. With drainage and antimicrobial therapy, the mesentericlymph nodes gradually decreased in size. However, loose stools persisted. Thecat's diet was changed to a hydrolysed diet, and the clinical symptoms improved, suggesting food-responsive enteropathy. This may be an underlying disease oflymph node abscesses. Lymph node abscesses limited to the mesenteric lymph nodes rarely occur in veterinary medicine, and this is the first report in cats.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Diastolic dysfunction is an early clinical feature of felinehypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The left ventricular filling in early diastoleis facilitated by the diastolic intraventricular pressure gradient (IVPG). Thestudy objectives were to evaluate color Doppler M-mode-derived IVPG calculationin cats as a non-invasive assessment of the left ventricular relaxation property to determine the normal ranges of peak IVPG in cats and investigate the influenceof left ventricular function and heart rate (HR). ANIMALS: One hundred and sixclient-owned apparently healthy cats. METHODS: Prospective cross-sectional study.Quantitative analysis of color Doppler M-mode images was used to estimate totaland segmental IVPGs non-invasively. RESULTS: The total IVPG was 0.76 mmHg (95%reference interval (RI): 0.28-1.29 mmHg), the basal IVPG 0.34 mmHg (95% RI:0.07-0.63 mmHg), and the mid-apical IVPG 0.42 mmHg (95% RI: 0.15-0.71 mmHg).Total and segmental IVPG increased with HR (P < 0.003), while segmental percentIVPG was HR independent. A short isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) and a highmitral annular velocity in early diastole were associated with an increase intotal IVPG (P = 0.008 and P = 0.009, respectively) adjusted for HR. An increasein IVPG was associated with an increase in mitral inflow velocity (P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Feline IVPGs increase with HR and a short IVRT, which was believedto be a normal physiologic adrenergic response associated with an increasedsympathetic tone. Future studies of segmental IVPG changes in feline HCM areneeded to evaluate the clinical applicability of color Doppler M-mode estimatedIVPGs in feline cardiology.

AB  - In this study, 192 diarrheal fecal samples were collected from 2019 to 2021 formonitoring the molecular prevalence of canine parvovirus 2 (CPV-2) among dogs in Southwest China, and 113 samples were detected as Carnivore protoparvovirus1-positive. Surprisingly, 28/113 (24.8%) strains were identified as felineparvovirus (FPV)-like viruses based on the key amino acid (aa) residues in VP2.Further, 6 FPV-like strains were successfully isolated and genome sequenced, and phylogenetic trees based on the genome, VP2 and NS1 sequences showed that the 6FPV-like strains were most genetically related with FPV instead of CPV-2.Interestingly, the VP2 proteins of the FPV-like virus contained all key aaresidues typical for FPV and can be 100% identical to that of FPV, but the VP1intron and NS1 aa sequences exhibited some unique molecular characteristics. The FPV-like isolate could hemagglutinate swine erythrocyte at pH values between 6and 8, and replicated efficiently in MDCK cell line; moreover, the virus couldcause canine systemic infection via oral administration. Further analysis basedon VP2 sequences of FPV and CPV-2 in GenBank revealed that the FPV-like virus hadalready existed among dogs in 4 Asian countries, and have circulated widely inChina. This study first confirmed that the FPV-like isolates could efficientlyinfect dogs, and has been prevalent among dogs in China. Moreover, this studyfirst reported the genome characteristics of the FPV-like virus in dogs, whichmay represent a novel evolution pattern involving in the cross-speciestransmission of the virus from cats to dogs.

AB  - We disclose a series of potent anti-viral 1,2,3-dithiazoles, accessed through asuccinct synthetic approach from 4,5-dichloro-1,2,3-dithiazolium chloride(Appel's salt). A series of small libraries of compounds were screened againstfeline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infected cells as a model for HIV. Thisapproach highlighted new structure activity relationship understanding and led tothe development of sub-micro molar anti-viral compounds with reduced toxicity. Inaddition, insight into the mechanistic progress of this system is provided viaadvanced QM-MM modelling. The 1,2,3-dithiazole represents a versatile scaffoldwith potential for further development to treat both FIV and HIV.

TI  - Identification of Copper Transporter 1 as a Receptor for Feline EndogenousRetrovirus ERV-DC14.
PG  - e0022922
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00229-22 [doi]
AB  - Vertebrates harbor hundreds of endogenous retroviral (ERV) sequences in theirgenomes, which are considered signs of past infections that occurred duringevolution. On rare occasions, ERV genes like env are maintained and coopted byhosts for physiological functions, but they also participate in recombinationevents with exogenous retroviruses to generate rearranged viruses with noveltropisms. In domestic cats, feline leukemia virus type D (FeLV-D) has beendescribed as a recombinant virus between the infectious FeLV-A and likely theERV-DC14 env gene that resulted in an extended tropism due to the usage of a new uncharacterized retroviral receptor. Here, we report the identification ofSLC31A1 encoding the copper transporter 1 (CTR1) as a susceptibility gene forERV-DC14 infection. Expression of human CTR1 into nonpermissive cells wassufficient to confer sensitivity to ERV-DC14 pseudotype infection and to increasethe binding of an ERV-DC14 Env ligand. Moreover, inactivation of CTR1 by genomeediting or cell surface downmodulation of CTR1 by a high dose of copperdramatically decreased ERV-DC14 infection and binding, while magnesium treatment had no effect. We also investigated the role of CTR1 in the nonpermissivity offeline and hamster cells. While feline CTR1 was fully functional for ERV-DC14, wefound that binding was strongly reduced upon treatment with conditioned medium offeline cells, suggesting that the observed resistance to infection was aconsequence of CTR1 saturation. In contrast, hamster CTR1 was inactive due to thepresence of a N-linked glycosylation site at position 27, which is absent in the human ortholog. These results provide evidence that CTR1 is a receptor forERV-DC14. Along with chimpanzee endogenous retrovirus type 2, ERV-DC14 is thesecond family of endogenous retrovirus known to have used CTR1 during pastinfections of vertebrates. IMPORTANCE Receptor usage is an important determinant of diseases induced by pathogenic retroviruses. In the case of feline leukemiaviruses, three subgroups (A, B, and C) based on their ability to recognizedifferent cell host receptors, respectively, the thiamine transporter THTR1, the phosphate transporter PiT1, and the heme exporter FLVCR1, are associated withdistinct feline diseases. FeLV-A is horizontally transmitted and found in allnaturally infected cats, while FeLV-B and FeLV-C have emerged from FeLV-A,respectively, by recombination with endogenous retroviral env sequences or bymutations in the FeLV-A env gene, both leading to a switch in receptor usage and in subsequent in vivo tropism. Here, we set up a genetic screen to identify theretroviral receptor of ERV-DC14, a feline endogenous provirus whose env gene has been captured by infectious FeLV-A to give rise to FeLV-D in a process similar toFeLV-B. Our results reveal that the copper transporter CTR1 was such a receptorand provide new insights into the acquisition of an expanded tropism by FeLV-D.

AB  - Objective The present study aimed to determine the average hip anthropometry of aregional Brazilian population using measurements based on computerized axialtomography (CAT). Methods Retrospective, descriptive analysis of hip measurementsfrom 200 abdominal CATs from patients visiting a medical center. The tests wereselected at random to determine 30 previously defined anthropometricmeasurements. The data were statistically analyzed and compared according togender and age. Results The prevalence of hip dysplasia was 6%. Signs suggesting femoroacetabular impingement were seen in 26% of cases. Patients over 50 yearsold presented significantly greater measures of horizontal acetabulum sectors,center-edge angle, and acetabular arch, as well as lower extrusion index,cervical-diaphyseal angle and vertical offset. Some measurements weresignificantly different according to gender: the lateral center-edge angle (micro= 35.5 degrees ) and the acetabular arch (micro = 68.7 degrees ) were higher infemales. Males presented increased extrusion index (micro = 16%), lateral offset (micro = 38.3 mm), depth (micro = 19.5 mm), and neck diameter (micro = 26.4 mm). Conclusion The present study characterized the hip anthropometry of a regionalBrazilian population. It also demonstrated significant morphological differences per age group and gender.

AB  - Bordetella bronchiseptica is a pleomorphic gram-negative coccobacillus thatcommonly causes respiratory tract infections in canines, felines, and swine.Human infections are rare. We report a case of Bordetella bronchisepticapneumonia in a 67-year-old immunocompromised host. His past medical historyincluded multiple myeloma treated with autologous bone marrow transplant followedby a chimeric antigen receptor cell therapy for relapse. He was admitted withunrelenting diarrhea due to HHV-6 pancolitis. During the hospital course hedeveloped high-grade fever (102.3 degrees F), cough and respiratory failurerequiring mechanical ventilation. Chest imaging demonstrated bilateral opacities most pronounced at lung bases and worsening mediastinal lymphadenopathy.Bronchoalveolar lavage cultures grew Bordetella bronchiseptica. He was treatedwith piperacillin/tazobactam, but developed progressive multiorgan failure,transitioned to comfort care, and expired in the hospital. Bordetellabronchiseptica is an organism that do not cause serious infection inimmunocompetent persons but can sometimes cause serious illness inimmunocompromised populations. It causes "kennel cough" in dogs and spready byrespiratory droplets. Dogs and cats are not uniformly vaccinated against thispathogen. Therefore, transmission through animal contact is becoming increasinglycommon. Realize that unlike other Bordetella spp, this pathogen is not typically responsive to erythromycin and is often resistant to ampicillin andcephalosporins so the typical neutropenic fever coverage with an antipseudomonal cephalosporin and azithromycin might not be effective. Given the increasingrecognition of this zoonosis as a threat to the immunocompromised, it isessential to educate immunocompromised patients to minimize zoonotic exposure, asimmunization of pets might not confer protection to humans.

AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) have been classified in the group of resistant bacteria of highest priority. We determined the prevalence of ESBL-E collected in feces from household and shelter pets inGuadeloupe (French West Indies). A single rectal swab was taken from 125 dogs and60 cats between June and September 2019. The prevalence of fecal carriage ofESBL-E was 7.6% (14/185, 95% CI: 4.2-12.4), within the range observed worldwide. The only risk factor associated with a higher prevalence of ESBL-E rectalcarriage was a stay in a shelter, suggesting that refuges could be hotspots fortheir acquisition. All but one (Klebsiella pneumoniae from a cat) wereEscherichia coli. We noted the presence of a bla CTX-M-1/IncI1-Igamma/sequencetype (ST3) plasmid in 11 ESBL-producing E. coli isolates belonging to ST328 (n = 6), ST155 (n = 4) and ST953 (n = 1). A bla CTX-M-15 gene was identified in thethree remaining ESBL-E isolates. The bla CTX-M-1 and most of the antimicrobialresistance genes were present in a well-conserved large conjugativeIncI1-Igamma/ST3 plasmid characterized by two accessory regions containingantibiotic resistance genes. The plasmid has been detected worldwide in E. coliisolates from humans and several animal species, such as food-producing animals, wild birds and pets, and from the environment. This study shows the potentialrole of pets as a reservoir of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria or genes forhumans and underlines the importance of basic hygiene measures by owners ofcompanion animals.

TI  - High-rise syndrome in cats and dogs.
LID - 10.1111/vec.13206 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the current literature pertaining to the pathophysiology,diagnosis, and treatment of injuries sustained from high-rise syndrome in catsand dogs. ETIOLOGY: High-rise syndrome is defined as a fall from a height of 2 ormore stories that results in a constellation of injuries, including thoracic,abdominal, orthopedic, and orofacial trauma. Animals often fall after slippingfrom windowsills, engaging in mating behavior, or chasing prey. Cats suffer less severe injuries than dogs due to their "righting reflex" and smaller body mass.Affected animals are younger, and the frequency of falls is higher in warmermonths. DIAGNOSIS: Physical examination coupled with radiographs, ultrasound, andcomputed tomography can diagnose a myriad of injuries that include pneumothorax, pleural or abdominal effusion, orthopedic fractures, and orofacial injuries.Bloodwork may identify anemia, thrombocytopenia, or increases in hepatic, renal, or pancreatic values consistent with trauma to these organs. Serial venous orarterial blood gas can help determine the severity of respiratory compromise and influence resuscitative efforts. Traditional coagulation tests andthromboelastography can assess trauma-induced coagulopathy and guide transfusion therapy. THERAPY: Animals presenting in shock require hemodynamic stabilization. Initial resuscitation may incorporate crystalloids, colloids, blood products, andanalgesics. Thoracic injuries may require oxygen, thoracocentesis, chest tubeplacement, and mechanical ventilation. Fractures and wounds are decontaminatedand splinted/bandaged, with definitive fixation pursued after stabilization.Abdominal injuries are managed medically unless there is severe ongoing bleeding,sepsis, or injury to the urinary tract. PROGNOSIS: In feline high-rise syndrome, the prognosis is generally excellent following treatment, with survival exceeding90%. Canine literature is sparse. The largest retrospective study reported a >90%survival to discharge and a greater need for surgical stabilization in thisspecies. There are no prognostic factors identified that are associated withsurvival for either species.

TI  - Evolution and functional diversification of catalase genes in the green lineage.
PG  - 411
LID - 10.1186/s12864-022-08621-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Catalases (CATs) break down hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygento prevent cellular oxidative damage, and play key roles in the development,biotic and abiotic stresses of plants. However, the evolutionary relationships ofthe plant CAT gene family have not been systematically reported. RESULTS: Here,we conducted genome-wide comparative, phylogenetic, and structural analyses ofCAT orthologs from 29 out of 31 representative green lineage species tocharacterize the evolution and functional diversity of CATs. We found that CATgenes in land plants were derived from core chlorophytes and detected alineage-specific loss of CAT genes in Fabaceae, suggesting that the CAT genes in this group possess divergent functions. All CAT genes were split into three majorgroups (group alpha, beta1, and beta2) based on the phylogeny. CAT genes weretransferred from bacteria to core chlorophytes and charophytes by lateral genetransfer, and this led to the independent evolution of two types of CAT genes:alpha and beta types. Ten common motifs were detected in both alpha and betagroups, and beta CAT genes had five unique motifs, respectively. The findings of our study are inconsistent with two previous hypotheses proposing that (i) newCAT genes are acquired through intron loss and that (ii) the Cys-343 residue ishighly conserved in plants. We found that new CAT genes in most higher plantswere produced through intron acquisition and that the Cys-343 residue was onlypresent in monocots, Brassicaceae and Pp_CatX7 in P. patens, which indicates the functional specificity of the CATs in these three lineages. Finally, our finding that CAT genes show high overall sequence identity but that individual CAT genes showed developmental stage and organ-specific expression patterns suggests thatCAT genes have functionally diverged independently. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, ouranalyses of the CAT gene family provide new insights into their evolution andfunctional diversification in green lineage species.

AB  - Azole resistance in Malassezia pachydermatis has been reported in isolates fromcanine skin worldwide. Decreased susceptibility of M. pachydermatis to azoles hasbeen hypothesized to potentially result from mutations in the ERG11 gene, whichencodes lanosterol 14alpha-demethylase. To sequence the mutation hotspots ofERG11 in the isolates, we prepared primers (MPERG11hot2S and MPERG11hot2R) based on the conserved sequences of M. pachydermatis ERG11. DNA samples fromazole-resistant and -susceptible strains were amplified by PCR using the primerpair. PCR amplicons were sequenced and analyzed for single-nucleotidepolymorphisms (SNPs) in the target gene. Seven of the tested azole-resistantstrains (16 strains) harbored ERG11 SNPs at nucleotide 904 (G-->A) or 905(C-->T), resulting in the replacement of Ala 302 with Thr or Val (Ala302Thr orVal). None of the tested azole-susceptible strains had a mutation at either ofthose residues. Our PCR method detected SNPs at the nucleotide-905 (C-->T)hotspot mutation site in M. pachydermatis ERG11. Moreover, we discovered anadditional hot spot site at nucleotide 904 (G-->A).

TI  - Development of an Item Bank for a Health-Related Quality of Life Measure inSpondyloarthritis.
LID - jrheum.210980 [pii]
LID - 10.3899/jrheum.210980 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is an important aspect in themanagement of chronic diseases such as spondyloarthritis (SpA). A promisingapproach to reduce respondent burden when measuring HRQOL is the use of shorterpatient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) delivered using computerized adaptivetests (CATs). However, the lack of an item bank that covers the entire continuum of the HRQOL domain impedes the development of CATs to measure HRQOL amongpatients with SpA. We aimed to develop an item bank for an HRQOL measure amongpatients with SpA based on the items from existing validated PROMs. METHODS: Thisstudy is guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review andMeta-Analysis (PRISMA) and Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement InformationSystem (PROMIS) standards. Relevant articles were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO (Ovid) databases. Items from existing PROMs were binned and winnowedaccording to the facets of HRQOL in the World Health Organization (WHO) qualityof life framework. RESULTS: We identified 147 relevant articles, from whichwritten permission was obtained for including 31 PROMs into the item bank. PROMs contained 1039 items, which underwent binning and winnowing. This resulted in 968items covering 23 domains of HRQOL in the WHO framework, with the number of itemswithin each domain ranging from 1 to 453. CONCLUSION: We created an item bank to measure HRQOL among patients with SpA using items from validated PROMs. This set can provide the foundation for the development of CATs to measure HRQOL amongpatients with SpA.

AB  - Anticoagulant rodenticides (ARs) are important tools for controlling rodentpests, but they also pose a health threat to non-target species. ARs are one ofthe most common causes of pet poisoning. However, exposure of domestic animals tosubclinical doses of ARs is poorly documented. To study the random exposure ofdogs and cats to ARs, feces from animals showing no clinical signs of rodenticidepoisoning were collected from a network of French and Belgian veterinarians. Weanalyzed fresh feces from 304 dogs and 289 cats by liquid chromatography-tandemmass spectrometry. This study showed a limited prevalence of AR exposure in dogs and cats of 2.6 and 4.5% respectively. In both species, access to the outdoors isa risk factor for ARs exposure. In contrast, the sex of the animals did notaffect the ARs exposure status. The observation of the ratio of cis and transisomers suggested primary exposure in dogs, but also in some cats. While primary exposure in dogs appears to be related to the use of ARs as plant protectionproducts, primary exposure in cats may be malicious, as warfarin, ananticoagulant formerly used as a rodenticide and now used only in humans, wasfound in 4 of 13 exposed cats. Secondary exposure may also occur in cats.Ourstudy showed reduced exposure in dogs and cats, compared to wildlife, which oftenhas high exposure, especially in areas where rodent control is important.

PG  - 894297
LID - 10.3389/fcimb.2022.894297 [doi]
AB  - Sporotrichosis has been expanding throughout the Brazilian territory in recentyears. New outbreaks have emerged, and consequently, the sporotrichosis agents,mainly Sporothrix brasiliensis, should remain in the environment somehow.Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the presence of Sporothrixspp. in the environment from an area of the Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, withrecurrent cases of human and animal sporotrichosis. Abandoned demolition timberwood samples were collected in the garden of a house where the cases of human andfeline sporotrichosis have occurred in the last 10 years. The environmentalsurvey revealed a Sporothrix spp. colony from the serial dilution cultures of oneabandoned demolition wood sample. In addition, a fungal strain isolated from acat with skin lesions that lived in the house was also included in the study. Thespecies-specific PCR, and calmodulin partial sequencing identified theenvironmental and cat isolates as S. brasiliensis. Furthermore, the phylogenetic analysis performed with the partial sequences of internal transcribed spacerregion and constitutive genes (calmodulin, beta-tubulin, and chitin synthase)showed high similarity between environmental and cat isolates from the samegeographic region. Moreover, the antifungal susceptibility test revealed that theminimal inhibitory concentration of itraconazole from the environment isolate waslower than the cat isolate, while amphotericin B and terbinafine were similar.Our results show that S. brasiliensis is able to maintain itself in theenvironmental material for years. With this, we corroborate that theeco-epidemiology of sporotrichosis is not well understood, and despite the major occurrence of S. brasiliensis in Brazil, it is rarely isolated from theenvironment.

AB  - The evolutionary lineage of neuronal phenotype is notably complex even within alimited number of species. One of the approaches resides in the realm of complex network theory. The theory reduces the connectomic data into a hallmarked set of few parameters, some of which might be correlated with a suitably chosenphylogenetic marker. In this first-of-its-kind attempt, interspecific variations of two structural complexity measures (i.e., clustering coefficient andcentrality) along with two independent information-theoretic measures (i.e., von Neumann entropy and multifractality) are investigated to decipher any hiddenevolutionary signature considering four mammalian connectomes (i.e., felis catus,mus musculus, macaca mulatta, and homo sapiens). All network complexity measures partially corroborate with the phylogenetic order. Nevertheless, monotonicity of the measures with the chosen phylogenetic marker of genome size has been majorly violated because of the mus musculus data point. On the other hand, von Neumannentropy was found to exhibit an allometric scaling behavior with the communitystructure of all connectomes (p<0.0001, and R(2)>0.95). The respective scalingexponent was noted to be monotonic with the genome size. Singularities of thereal connectomes were also investigated upon carrying out a similar analysis inthree equivalent synthetic network models.

TI  - A quarterly Survey of antibiotic prescribing in small animal and equinepractices-Minnesota and North Dakota, 2020.
LID - 10.1111/zph.12979 [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobials are critical for medicine, but the problem of antimicrobialresistance (AMR) threatens the effectiveness of these valuable drugs. In USA,there are no national- or state-level programs or policies in place to trackantibiotic use (AU) in dogs, cats, and horses, despite acknowledgement of thissector's importance to both the AMR problem and its solution. AU measurement is akey part of antibiotic stewardship and AMR prevention. This study aimed to fillexisting gaps in the veterinary professions' knowledge of antibiotic prescribing in small animals and horses. To address this aim, medical record data werecollected on a single day per quarter for 1 year from 19 Minnesota and NorthDakota small animal and equine practices, totaling 1,899 veterinarian consults ofdogs, cats, and horses. Overall, 25.8% of all canine, feline, and equine consultsinvolved an antibiotic prescription. Third-generation cephalosporins were themost commonly prescribed systemic antibiotic drug class, and the long-actinginjectable drug, cefovecin, was the most commonly prescribed antibiotic for cats (34.5%). Topical antibiotic preparations were prescribed frequently, especiallyin dogs (42.5% of canine prescriptions), though systemic antibiotics were oftenprescribed concurrently. Common general indications, based on problem ordiagnosis recorded in the medical record, for antibiotics in all species combinedwere skin conditions (24.4%), otitis (22.1%), ophthalmic (9.4%), gastrointestinal(8.3%), respiratory (8.3%), and urinary tract (7.6%) diseases. While 44.2% ofpatients for which antibiotics were prescribed had cytology performed, only 3.9% had bacterial culture and susceptibility performed. In a pre-study survey,veterinarians' recommendations for AU differed from actual prescribing,suggesting collection of AU data provides more accurate assessments of veterinaryprescribing behaviour than surveys. This study shows feasibility of AUmeasurement in small animals and horses. The data collection tool and standardoperating procedures described prove suitable for national AU data collection.

TI  - Estimating short and longer-term exposure of domestic cats to dietary iodinefluctuation.
PG  - 8987
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-13139-8 [doi]
AB  - Hyperthyroidism is a common endocrinopathy of domestic felines. In humans, toxic nodular goitre is pathophysiologically similar to feline hyperthyroidism and can be caused by chronically low or fluctuating dietary iodine intake. Theaetiopathogenesis of feline hyperthyroidism is not known, but chronically low or fluctuating dietary iodine intake is likely common. This study assessed habitual iodine intake in domestic cats by: (1) conducting a dietary survey involving 361 owners of 549 cats, (2) analysing iodine content of 119 cat feeds, 38 urine and64 hair samples and (3) assessing variation in iodine content of eight cat feeds over 4-6 different batches. Owners varied their cats feed regularly, usually on aday-to-day basis and often between wet and dry feeds with differing flavours. Themajority (78%; 93 of 119) feeds for cats were within the guideline range foriodine. Of the 22% (n = 26 feeds) that were not compliant, the majority (n = 23) were below the nutritional minimum value with most (n = 16) being dry kibble.Iodine content of feeds did not vary considerably between types of feed or feedpackaging, but variation between different batches of the same feed was 14-31%.Hence, urine iodine in cats also varied markedly. Cats being treated forhyperthyroidism had lower hair iodine. In conclusion, a survey assessing howdomestic cats are fed, together with an analysis of commercial cat feeds suggeststhat domestic cats are likely to experience chronically low or fluctuatingdietary iodine intake. The latter is supported by wide variation in urine iodine content.

AB  - In response to the EU cosmetics directive regulation and REACH legislation which encourage cell culture methods in order to reduce or replace the use of animalsin toxicology studies, we settled the culture of prepubertal domestic catseminiferous tubules in our validated BioAlter(R) model, usually used withprepubertal rat, called here BioAlter(R)-rat, by opposition to BioAlter(R)-catsettled here. We carried out a comparative study on the effects of 3 testiculartoxicants, 1,3-dinitrobenzene at 60 muM, 2-methoxyacetic acid at 2.5 mM andcarbendazim at 50 nM or 500 nM in both BioAlter(R)-cat and BioAlter(R)-rat over a3-week culture period. Sertoli cell or each germ cell populations as well as the levels of Sertoli cell or germ cell specific mRNAs were studied. The harmfuleffects of the 3 toxicants on pre-meiotic, meiotic and post-meiotic cell numbers and on Sertoli or germ cell specific mRNAs were clearly observed in the twospecies, even if there might be some small differences in the intensity of theeffects on some of the studied parameters. Hence, BioAlter(R)-cat might be asolution to the requirements of the EU cosmetics directive and REACH legislation for male reproductive toxicology studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Several cases of reverse transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from human topets were reported during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly,the World Organization for Animal Health has recommended to improve SARS-CoV-2surveillance on household animals to assess the risk of transmission betweenspecies. After such recommendation, we studied the potential SARS-CoV-2 infectionin household dogs and cats in the city of Guayaquil, the most populated city inEcuador. METHODS: Oral and nasal swab samples were collected from dogs and catswithin 10 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result of their owners. Totalribonucleic acid was extracted and detection of viral gene targets N and ORF1abwas performed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.RESULTS: From the 50 cats and dogs tested, 12 were SARS-CoV-2 positive, giving a total positivity rate of 24%. A total of 1 of 8 cats tested positive, whereas 11 of 42 dogs were positive, yielding a positivity rate of 12.5% and 26.2%,respectively. SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed by whole genome sequencing. In addition,we also found a statistically significant association between SARS-CoV-2 petpositivity and food sharing with infected owners. CONCLUSION: This study is thesecond active surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in household dogs and cats in LatinAmerica. Moreover, it is the first study to address the risk factors associatedwith potential anthropogenic SARS-CoV-2 transmission to domestic cats and dogs.Given the high presence of free-roaming dogs and cats in rural and urban areas inLatin American countries and the high capacity shown by coronaviruses forinterspecies transmission, our findings support the view that SARS-CoV-2surveillance in pets is necessary to better understand the role that pet-humaninteraction plays in the COVID-19 spread.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report indications, complications, and long-term outcomes followingfeline total hip replacement (THR) using a client-based clinical metrologyquestionnaire, the Feline Musculoskeletal Pain Index (FMPI), and ownersatisfaction. STUDY DESIGN: Multi-institutional retrospective cohort study.ANIMALS: Cats (n = 44) that underwent THR (n = 56). METHODS: Feline THRssubmitted to a registry over a 10-year period were reviewed. The FMPI and ownersatisfaction surveys were used to assess outcome. RESULTS: Forty-four cats metthe inclusion criteria. Median age was 2 years (range: 0.9-11), and medianbodyweight 5 kg (range: 3.3-7.6). British Shorthair and Domestic Shorthair werethe most frequent breeds. Most cats were neutered males (33/44) and slippedcapital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) was the most common surgical indication (34/56).All implants were cemented micro and nano hip implants. Overall complications(11/56) included 9 major complications. The median duration of follow up was 752 days (range: 102-3089). No association was found between clinical variables andcomplications. The FMPI score improved from 0.111 (range: 0-1.222) to 2.111(range: 0.888-3.666) postoperatively (P < .001). Owner satisfaction was reported as "very good" in 30/33 cases (90.9%). CONCLUSION: A validated client metrologyquestionnaire showed clinical improvement in cats following THR. The most common indication for THR in cats was SCFE occurring in young male neutered cats.Complication rates were comparable to previous reports. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE:Total hip replacement appears to be a successful surgical treatment for felinehip disease with very good owner satisfaction and acceptable complication rates.

TI  - Spay/neuter laws as a debated approach to stabilizing the populations of dogs andcats: An overview of the European legal framework and remarks.

LID - 10.1080/10888705.2022.2081807 [doi]
AB  - To reduce the (over) population of unwanted companion non human animals, namelydogs and cats. They are used to lower negative impacts on human societies and on the animals themselves, and opting for the neutering status is usually considereda demonstration of "responsible ownership." In Western countries, however, suchprovisions are not uniform and must increasingly be balanced with the recognitionof animals as sentient beings with interests under the law. Furthermore, there isno consensus on whether routine neutering benefits both human and nonhumanparties, and the veterinary profession progressively claims the need forcase-by-case management. Such premises make deciding how to manage companionanimals' reproductive lives legally challenging. The current work examines theEuropean legal framework for companion animal protection and animal legal status after providing a brief overview of the global problem of overpopulation.Subsequently, the author discusses the main legal approaches to controllingcompanion animal reproduction, in European countries. Remarks about the legallybinding option and on alternative approaches are provided, while highlighting thepersistent need for appropriate and coherent European legislation.

AB  - Choline is an essential nutrient linked to hepatic lipid metabolism in manyanimal species, including cats. The current study investigated the serum lipidprofiles, serum liver enzymes, respiratory quotients, and energy expenditures of overweight cats fed maintenance diets, in response to graded doses ofsupplemental dietary choline. Overweight (body condition score [BCS]: >/=6/9)adult male neutered cats (n = 14) were supplemented with five choline chloridedoses for 3-wk periods, in a 5 x 5 Latin square design. Doses were based onindividual body weight (BW) and the daily recommended allowance (RA) for choline (63 mg/kg BW0.67) according to the National Research Council. Doses were control (no additional choline: 1.2 x RA, 77 mg/kg BW0.67), 2 x RA (126 mg/kg BW0.67), 4 x RA (252 mg/kg BW0.67), 6 x RA (378 mg/kg BW0.67), and 8 x RA (504 mg/kgBW0.67). Choline was top-dressed over the commercial extruded cat food (3,620 mg choline/kg diet), fed once a day at maintenance energy requirements (130kcal/kgBW0.4). Body weight and BCS were assessed weekly. Fasted blood sampleswere taken and indirect calorimetry was performed at the end of each 3-wk period.Serum was analyzed for cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C),triglycerides, non-esterified fatty acids, glucose, creatinine, blood ureanitrogen (BUN), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and alanine aminotransferase. Verylow-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL) and low-density lipoproteincholesterol were calculated. Data were analyzed via SAS using proc GLIMMIX, with group and period as the random effects, and treatment as the fixed effect.Statistical significance was considered at P < 0.05. Body weight and BCS did not change (P > 0.05). Serum cholesterol, HDL-C, triglycerides, and VLDL increasedwith 6 x RA (P < 0.05). Serum ALP decreased with 8 x RA (P = 0.004). Choline at 4x and 6 x RA decreased serum BUN (P = 0.006). Fed or fasted respiratory quotient and energy expenditure did not differ among dietary choline doses (P > 0.05).These results suggest that dietary choline supplementation at 6 x RA may increasehepatic fat mobilization through increased lipoprotein transport and beneficiallysupport hepatic health in overweight cats. Future studies that combine theseresults with existing knowledge of feline weight loss and hepatic lipidosis arewarranted.

OAB - Choline is an essential nutrient important for lipid metabolism in the liver ofmany mammals. In the present study, fourteen overweight cats had their commercialextruded cat food top-dressed with different amounts of choline chloridesupplement. The amounts of choline were based on the individual body weights and the published recommended allowance (RA) for dietary choline intake in adultcats. The choline treatments were control (no additional choline added, 1.2 xRA), 2 x RA, 4 x RA, 6 x RA, and 8 x RA. The cats were separated into fivegroups. Each group received the choline treatments once daily for 3 wk pertreatment. Choline at 6 x RA increased serum cholesterol, triglycerides, andlipoproteins. There were no significant differences in respiratory quotient orenergy expenditure with choline intake. The results of this study suggest thatcholine at 6 x RA increases the transport of lipids from the liver. This may bebeneficial in supporting liver health in overweight cats. Future studies shouldinvestigate supplementing choline to cats undergoing weight loss and those atrisk of developing fatty liver.

LID - 10.1093/molbev/msac117 [doi]
AB  - Ecological differentiation among diverging species is an important component ofthe evolutionary process and can be investigated in rapid and recent radiations. Here, we use whole genome sequences of five species from the genus Leopardus, arecently diversified Neotropical lineage with species bearing distinctivemorphological, ecological, and behavioral features, to investigate genome-widediversity, comparative demographic history and signatures of positive selection. Our results show that divergent ecological strategies are reflected in genomicfeatures, for example a generalist species shows historically larger effectivepopulation size and higher heterozygosity than habitat specialists. Thedemographic history of these cats seems to have been jointly driven by climatefluctuations and habitat specialization, with different ecological adaptationsleading to distinct trajectories. Finally, a gene involved in vertebrate retinal neurogenesis (POU4F2) was found to be under positive selection in the margay, acat with notoriously large eyes that are likely associated with its nocturnal andarboreal specializations.

LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiac143 [doi]
AB  - Isolated reports of new-onset diabetes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have led researchers to hypothesize that severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects human exocrine and endocrinepancreatic cells ex vivo and in vivo. However, existing research lacksexperimental evidence indicating that SARS-CoV-2 can infect pancreatic tissue.Here, we found that cats infected with a high dose of SARS-CoV-2 exhibitedhyperglycemia. We also detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in pancreatic tissues of thesecats, and immunohistochemical staining revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-2nucleocapsid protein (NP) in islet cells. SARS-CoV-2 NP and spike proteins wereprimarily detected in glucagon-positive cells, and most glucagon-positive cellsexpressed ACE2. Additionally, immune protection experiments conducted on catsshowed that blood glucose levels of immunized cats did not increasepostchallenge. Our data indicate cat pancreas as a SARS-CoV-2 target and suggest that the infection of glucagon-positive cells could contribute to the metabolicdysregulation observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected cats.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Biological behaviour and treatment options of non-injection-site softtissue sarcomas (nFISS) in cats are less well understood than in dogs. The aim ofthis retrospective study was to assess the outcomes of cats with nFISS following treatment with adjuvant radiotherapy. METHODS: The medical records of cats withsoft tissue sarcomas in locations not associated with, and histology reports not suggestive of, injection-site sarcomas were reviewed. All cats underwent adjuvantradiotherapy, either hypofractionated (32-36 Gy delivered in weekly 8-9 Gyfractions) or conventionally fractionated (48-54 Gy delivered in 16-18 3 Gyfractions) to microscopic disease. RESULTS: In total, 18 cats were included inthe study, 17 with extremity nFISS and one with facial nFISS. Nine receivedradiotherapy after a single surgery and nine after multiple surgeries forrecurrent nFISS. Eight cats were treated with a hypofractionated protocol and 10 with a conventionally fractionated protocol. The median follow-up time was 540days (range 51-3317 days). The tumour recurred in eight (44.4%) cats followingadjuvant radiotherapy; it recurred in three (37.5%) cats following ahypofractionated protocol and in five (50%) cats following a conventionallyfractionated protocol. The overall median progression-free interval (PFI) for17/18 cats was 2748 days, while the median PFI for the 7/8 cats with recurrencewas 164 days. The recurrence for one cat was reported, but the date was unknownand it was therefore censored from these data. When stratifying based on theprotocol, the median PFI for hypofractionated and conventionally fractionatedprotocols was 164 days and 2748 days, respectively. Statistically, there was nosignificant difference between the two protocols (P = 0.636). CONCLUSIONS ANDRELEVANCE: Adjuvant radiotherapy resulted in good long-term tumour control in12/18 cats with nFISS. Further studies in larger populations are required toassess the significance of radiation dose and fractionation on tumour control andthe effect of multiple surgeries prior to initiation of radiotherapy on outcome.

LID - 10.1128/spectrum.00403-22 [doi]
AB  - The blaOXA-48/IncL plasmid is increasingly reported in dogs, even in the absence of carbapenem use in animals. In this study, we witnessed the spread of thisplasmid within and between dogs sharing the same relaxing area. This indicates a very dynamic situation where carbapenem resistance can be transmitted betweendogs and expanded in the dogs' gut. As a consequence, picking up dog feces maylower both this dynamic and the global antimicrobial resistance burden.IMPORTANCE The use of carbapenems in animals is forbidden in France due to their critical importance to treat human diseases. Nevertheless, blaOXA-48-producingEnterobacterales were sporadically recovered in cats and dogs, most likely as aspill over from the human reservoir. This study highlights the rapid spread ofblaOXA-48 once transmitted to dogs, suggesting that companion animals can play a role in the transmission routes of carbapenemase genes.

TI  - HIV and FIV glycoproteins increase cellular tau pathology via cGMP-dependentkinase II activation.

LID - 10.1242/jcs.259764 [doi]
AB  - As the development of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) against humanimmunodeficiency virus (HIV) drastically improves the lifespan of individualswith HIV, many are now entering the prime age when Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like symptoms begin to manifest. It has been shown that hyperphosphorylated tau, aknown AD pathological characteristic, is prematurely increased in the brains ofHIV-infected individuals as early as in their 30s and that its levels increasewith age. This suggests that HIV infection might lead to accelerated ADphenotypes. However, whether HIV infection causes AD to develop more quickly inthe brain is not yet fully determined. Interestingly, we have previously revealedthat the viral glycoproteins HIV gp120 and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)gp95 induce neuronal hyperexcitation via cGMP-dependent kinase II (cGKII; alsoknown as PRKG2) activation in cultured hippocampal neurons. Here, we use culturedmouse cortical neurons to demonstrate that the presence of HIV gp120 and FIV gp95are sufficient to increase cellular tau pathology, including intracellular tauhyperphosphorylation and tau release to the extracellular space. We furtherreveal that viral glycoprotein-induced cellular tau pathology requires cGKIIactivation. Taken together, HIV infection likely accelerates AD-related taupathology via cGKII activation.

TI  - Prevalence of serum immunoglobulin E against cross-reactive carbohydratedeterminants in allergic and nonallergic horses, and its impact onpolysensitisation in serum allergen tests.
PG  - 338-e79
LID - 10.1111/vde.13073 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The existence of antibodies against cross-reactive carbohydratedeterminants (CCDs) has been studied extensively in humans, and more recently, indogs and cats. These antibodies can reduce the specificity of in vitro serumallergen tests. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of anti-CCDimmunoglobulin (Ig)E in both allergic and nonallergic horses as well as evaluate its potential impact on serum allergen testing. ANIMALS: Twenty-one allergic and 21 nonallergic horses. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sera were analysed for anti-CCD IgEutilising a commercial CHO enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). An allergenspecific Fc-epsilon receptor ELISA then was performed to evaluatepolysensitisation, both with and without the addition of a proprietary anti-CCDblocking solution. RESULTS: Antibodies against CCD were detected in 30 of 42horses. There was no statistically significant difference (p = 0.18) between the allergic and healthy groups in regard to anti-CCD prevalence. Horses withanti-CCD IgE exhibited more polysensitisation on serum allergen tests than horseswithout anti-CCD IgE in all allergen groups except mites. Polysensitisation wasstatistically significant at the 95% confidence interval for grasses (p <0.03),weeds (p = 0.02) and stinging insects (p = 0.0005). This was found to be trueacross both study groups. Inhibition with an anti-CCD blocking solution resulted in a 43% average reduction in polysensitisation. CONCLUSION AND CLINICALIMPORTANCE: The prevalence of anti-CCD IgE of horses in this study coincides withthe prevalence detected in pollen-sensitised people. Horses with anti-CCD IgEexhibited more positive reactions on serum allergen tests. By minimisingpotential artifactual polysensitisation, inclusion of an anti-CCD blocker mayfacilitate identification of allergen-specific IgE.

PG  - e194-e202
LID - 10.1177/1098612X221100082 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The relationship between blood group antigens and disease has beenstudied in humans. Blood types have been associated with both decreased andincreased rates of various infections. In addition, blood group expression hasbeen shown to vary with some cancers and gastrointestinal diseases. The objectiveof this study was to explore whether there is a relationship between blood typeand retroviral infections in cats. METHODS: Case records from a veterinaryresearch laboratory, veterinary teaching hospitals and veterinary blood bankswere retrospectively searched for cats where both blood type and retroviralstatus (feline leukemia [FeLV], feline immunodeficiency virus [FIV] or both) werelisted (part 1). In addition, a sample of 33 cats with confirmed FIV infectionwas genotyped to determine blood groups (part 2). RESULTS: In part 1, 709 catswere identified, 119 of which were positive for retroviral infection. Among allcases, 621 were type A (87.6%), 68 were type B (9.6%) and 20 were type AB (2.8%).There was no relationship between overall retroviral status (positive/negative)and blood type (P = 0.43), between FeLV status and blood type (P = 0.86) orbetween FIV status and blood type (P = 0.94). There was no difference in thedistribution of blood types between cats that were healthy and typed as possible blood donors vs sick cats that were typed prior to a possible transfusion (P =0.13). In part 2, of the 33 FIV-infected cats, all blood group genotypes wereidentified, although this test did not discriminate type A from type AB.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: No relationship was identified between felineretroviral status and blood type in this study. The relationship between bloodtype and other disease states requires further study in veterinary patients.

TI  - Anti-Mullerian hormone as a diagnostic tool to identify queens with ovarianremnant syndrome.
PG  - e168-e174
LID - 10.1177/1098612X221099195 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ovarian remnant syndrome (ORS) is suspected when heat signs occur in spayed individuals, but further diagnostic procedures are necessary to excludeother possible oestrogen sources, such as the adrenal gland or exogenoussupplementation. Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), secreted by granulosa cells orSertoli cells, serves to differentiate sexually intact from gonadectomisedanimals and has been described in dogs as a tool for diagnosing ORS. The aim ofthis study was to evaluate if AMH determination can be used to diagnose ORS incats. METHODS: AMH was measured with a chemiluminescence immunoassay in serumsamples of 15 sexually intact, 9 spayed and 16 cats with a history of heat signs after spaying. Abdominal ultrasound (n = 13), vaginal smears (n = 7),progesterone measurement (n = 5) and laparotomy (n = 14) were used to determinethe presence of ovarian tissue. After surgery, a histological examination of the obtained tissue was performed in the cats with suspected ORS. RESULTS: In 15 catswith ORS the AMH serum concentrations were significantly higher than in spayedcats (n = 10; P = 0.025) and significantly lower than in sexually intact cats (n = 15; P = 0.001). Among the cats with ORS, the highest AMH serum concentrationswere measured in the queens with cystic ovarian alterations and in one cat fromwhich a whole ovary was obtained. The cat with the lowest AMH serum concentrationhad a simultaneous high progesterone serum concentration. Cats with ORS did notshow any heat signs after surgical removal of the ovarian tissue. CONCLUSIONS ANDRELEVANCE: A single determination of AMH in blood serum is a useful diagnostictool for the diagnosis of ORS in cats, regardless of the hormonal activity of theremnant ovarian tissue.

AB  - Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common and potentially fatal heart diseasein many cat breeds. An intronic variant in TNNT2, c.95-108G>A, was recentlyreported as the cause of HCM in the Maine Coon. The aim of this study was todetermine this variant's allele frequency in different populations and itspossible association with HCM. Based on 160 Maine Coon samples collected inBelgium, Italy, Sweden and the USA, the variant's allele frequency was estimated to be 0.32. Analysis of the 99 Lives feline whole genome sequencing databaseshowed that the TNNT2 variant also occurs in other breeds, as well as mixed-breedcats. Comparison of 31 affected and 58 healthy cats did not reveal significantly increased odds for HCM in homozygotes. Based on the combined evidence and inagreement with the standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequencevariants, this variant is currently classified as a variant of unknownsignificance and should not be used for breeding decisions regarding HCM.

TI  - Arthritis in cat scratch disease: an unusual manifestation.
PG  - 98-99
AB  - Cat scratch disease (CSD) is a zoonosis caused by Bartonella henselae, which isusually transmitted to humans through scratches or bites from infected cats. Itis primarily a disease of children and adolescents, although it can affectindividuals of any age. In approximately 10% of cases, patients can presentatypical manifestations that may involve the musculoskeletal system. Herein, wereport a case of a healthy 51-year-old man that developed low-grade fever andregional lymphadenopathy, followed by erythema nodosum and oligoarthritis. He hadbeen scratched and bitten by his cat before the onset of symptoms. The diagnosis was confirmed serologically by the presence of high titers of specific IgGantibodies. Bartonella henselae was also detected in the blood of the owner's catby PCR and DNA sequencing.

TI  - Environmental risk factors for the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma incats.
PG  - 1398-1408
LID - 10.1111/jvim.16372 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Risk factors for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in cats arederived from a single study dated almost 20 years ago. The relationship betweeninflammation of oral tissues and OSCC is still unclear. OBJECTIVES: Toinvestigate previously proposed and novel potential risk factors for OSCCdevelopment, including oral inflammatory diseases. ANIMALS: Hundred cats withOSCC, 70 cats with chronic gingivostomatitis (CGS), 63 cats with periodontaldisease (PD), and 500 controls. METHODS: Prospective, observational case-control study. Cats with OSCC were compared with an age-matched control sample ofclient-owned cats and cats with CGS or PD. Owners of cats completed an anonymous questionnaire including demographic, environmental and lifestyle information.RESULTS: On multivariable logistic regression, covariates significantlyassociated with an increased risk of OSCC were rural environment (OR: 1.77; 95%CI: 1.03-3.04; P = .04), outdoor access (OR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.07-2.63; P = .02),environmental tobacco smoke (OR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.05-3; P = .03), and petfoodcontaining chemical additives (OR: 1.98; 95% CI: 1.04-3.76; P = .04). Riskfactors shared with CGS and PD were outdoor access and petfood containingchemical additives, respectively. A history of oral inflammation was reported in 35% of cats with OSCC but did not emerge as a risk factor. CONCLUSIONS ANDCLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The study proposes novel potential risk factors for OSCC in cats. Although a history of inflammatory oral disease was not significantly more frequent compared with random age-matched controls, OSCC shared several riskfactors with CGS and PD.

TI  - Adaptation of the H7N2 Feline Influenza Virus to Human Respiratory Cell Culture.
LID - 1091 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14051091 [doi]
AB  - During 2016-2017, the H7N2 feline influenza virus infected more than 500 cats in animal shelters in New York, USA. A veterinarian who had treated the cats became infected with this feline virus and showed mild respiratory symptoms. Thissuggests that the H7N2 feline influenza virus may evolve into a novel pandemicvirus with a high pathogenicity and transmissibility as a result of mutations in humans. In this study, to gain insight into the molecular basis of thetransmission of the feline virus to humans, we selected mutant viruses withenhanced growth in human respiratory A549 cells via successive passages of thevirus and found almost all mutations to be in the envelope glycoproteins, such ashemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). The reverse genetics approach revealedthat the HA mutations, HA1-H16Q, HA2-I47T, or HA2-Y119H, in the stalk region can lead to a high growth of mutant viruses in A549 cells, possibly by changing thepH threshold for membrane fusion. Furthermore, NA mutation, I28S/L, orthree-amino-acid deletion in the transmembrane region can enhance viral growth inA549 cells, possibly by changing the HA-NA functional balance. These findingssuggest that the H7N2 feline influenza virus has the potential to become a human pathogen by adapting to human respiratory cells, owing to the synergisticbiological effect of the mutations in its envelope glycoproteins.

TI  - Fecal Feline Coronavirus RNA Shedding and Spike Gene Mutations in Cats withFeline Infectious Peritonitis Treated with GS-441524.
LID - 1069 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14051069 [doi]
AB  - As previously demonstrated by our research group, the oral multicomponent drugXraphconn((R)) containing GS-441524 was effective at curing otherwise fatalfeline infectious peritonitis (FIP) in 18 feline coronavirus (FCoV)-infectedcats. The aims of the current study were to investigate, using samples from thesame animals as in the previous study, (1) the effect of treatment on fecal viralRNA shedding; (2) the presence of spike gene mutations in different bodycompartments of these cats; and (3) viral RNA shedding, presence of spike genemutations, and anti-FCoV antibody titers in samples of 12 companion catscohabitating with the treated cats. Eleven of the eighteen treated FIP cats (61%)were shedding FCoV RNA in feces within the first three days after treatmentinitiation, but all of them tested negative by day 6. In one of these cats, fecalshedding reoccurred on day 83. Two cats initially negative in feces weretransiently positive 1-4 weeks into the study. The remaining five cats never shedFCoV. Viral RNA loads in feces decreased with time comparable with those in bloodand effusion. Specific spike gene mutations linked to systemic FCoV spread wereconsistently found in blood and effusion from treated FIP cats, but not in feces from treated or companion cats. A new mutation that led to a not yet describedamino acid change was identified, indicating that further mutations may beinvolved in the development of FIP. Eight of the twelve companion cats shed FCoV in feces. All but one of the twelve companion cats had anti-FCoV antibodies. Oraltreatment with GS-441524 effectively decreased viral RNA loads in feces, blood,and effusion in cats with FIP. Nonetheless, re-shedding can most likely occur if cats are re-exposed to FCoV by their companion cats.

TI  - Novel Polymorphisms and Genetic Characteristics of the Shadow of Prion ProteinGene (SPRN) in Cats, Hosts of Feline Spongiform Encephalopathy.
LID - 981 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14050981 [doi]
AB  - Prion diseases are transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) caused bypathogenic prion protein (PrP(Sc)) originating from normal prion protein (PrP(C))and have been reported in several types of livestock and pets. Recent studieshave reported that the shadow of prion protein (Sho) encoded by the shadow ofprion protein gene (SPRN) interacts with prion protein (PrP) and acceleratesprion diseases. In addition, genetic polymorphisms in the SPRN gene are relatedto susceptibility to prion diseases. However, genetic polymorphisms in the felineSPRN gene and structural characteristics of the Sho have not been investigated incats, a major host of feline spongiform encephalopathy (FSE). We performedamplicon sequencing to identify feline SPRN polymorphisms in the 623 bpencompassing the open reading frame (ORF) and a small part of the 3' untranslatedregion (UTR) of the SPRN gene. We analyzed the impact of feline SPRNpolymorphisms on the secondary structure of SPRN mRNA using RNAsnp. In addition, to find feline-specific amino acids, we carried out multiple sequence alignments using ClustalW. Furthermore, we analyzed the N-terminal signal peptide andglycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor using SignalP and PredGPI,respectively. We identified three novel SNPs in the feline SPRN gene and did not find strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) among the three SNPs. We found four majorhaplotypes of the SPRN polymorphisms. Strong LD was not observed between PRNP andSPRN polymorphisms. In addition, we found alterations in the secondary structure and minimum free energy of the mRNA according to the haplotypes in the SPRNpolymorphisms. Furthermore, we found four feline-specific amino acids in thefeline Sho using multiple sequence alignments among several species. Lastly, the N-terminal signal sequence and cutting site of the Sho protein of cats showedsimilarity with those of other species. However, the feline Sho protein exhibitedthe shortest signal sequence and a unique amino acid in the omega-site of the GPIanchor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on geneticpolymorphisms of the feline SPRN gene.

TI  - Calicivirus Infection in Cats.
LID - 937 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14050937 [doi]
AB  - Feline calicivirus (FCV) is a common pathogen in domestic cats that is highlycontagious, resistant to many disinfectants and demonstrates a high geneticvariability. FCV infection can lead to serious or even fatal diseases. In thisreview, the European Advisory Board on Cat Diseases (ABCD), a scientificallyindependent board of experts in feline medicine from 11 European countries,presents the current knowledge of FCV infection and fills gaps with expertopinions. FCV infections are particularly problematic in multicat environments.FCV-infected cats often show painful erosions in the mouth and mild upperrespiratory disease and, particularly in kittens, even fatal pneumonia. However, infection can be associated with chronic gingivostomatitis. Rarely, highlyvirulent FCV variants can induce severe systemic disease with epizootic spreadand high mortality. FCV can best be detected by reverse-transcriptase PCR.However, a negative result does not rule out FCV infection and healthy cats cantest positive. All cats should be vaccinated against FCV (core vaccine); however,vaccination protects cats from disease but not from infection. Considering thehigh variability of FCV, changing to different vaccine strain(s) may be ofbenefit if disease occurs in fully vaccinated cats. Infection-induced immunity isnot life-long and does not protect against all strains; therefore, vaccination ofcats that have recovered from caliciviral disease is recommended.

TI  - Vaccination of Immunocompromised Cats.
LID - 923 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14050923 [doi]
AB  - Immunocompromise is a common condition in cats, especially due to widespreadinfections with immunosuppressive viruses, such as feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), but also due to chronic non-infectiousdiseases, such as tumours, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease, as wellas treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, such as glucocorticoids, cyclosporins,or tumour chemotherapy. In this review, the European Advisory Board on CatDiseases (ABCD), a scientifically independent board of experts in feline medicinefrom eleven European countries, discusses the current knowledge and rationale forvaccination of immunocompromised cats. So far, there are few data available onvaccination of immunocompromised cats, and sometimes studies producecontroversial results. Thus, this guideline summarizes the available scientificstudies and fills in the gaps with expert opinion, where scientific studies aremissing. Ultimately, this review aims to help veterinarians with theirdecision-making in how best to vaccinate immunocompromised cats.

TI  - Role of Feline Coronavirus as Contributor to Diarrhea in Cats from BreedingCatteries.
LID - 858 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14050858 [doi]
AB  - (1) Background: Feline coronavirus infection (FCoV) is common in multi-catenvironments. A role of FCoV in causing diarrhea is often assumed, but has notbeen proven. The aim of this study was to evaluate an association of FCoVinfection with diarrhea in multi-cat environments. (2) Methods: The studyincluded 234 cats from 37 catteries. Fecal samples were analyzed for FCoV RNA by reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Potentialco-infections were determined by applying a qPCR panel on different potentialenteropathogens and fecal flotation. A fecal scoring system was used tocategorize feces as diarrheic or non-diarrheic. (3) Results: Of the 234 catsincluded, 23 had diarrhea. The prevalence of FCoV infection was 87.0% in catswith and 58.8% in cats without diarrhea. FCoV infection was significantlyassociated with diarrhea (Odds Ratio (OR) 5.01; p = 0.008). In addition, presenceof Clostridium perfringens alpha toxin (OR 6.93; p = 0.032) and felinepanleukopenia virus (OR 13.74; p = 0.004) were associated with an increased risk of diarrhea. There was no correlation between FCoV load and fecal score.FCoV-positive cats with co-infections were not more likely to have diarrhea than FCoV-positive cats without co-infections (p = 0.455). (4) Conclusions: FCoVinfection is common in cats from catteries and can be associated with diarrhea.

In an effort to identify any novel adaptations associated with thisapparent shift in tropism we carried out detailed evolutionary analyses of thespike gene of this virus in the context of related Alphacoronavirus 1 species.The spike 0-domain retains homology to CCoV2b (enteric infections) andTransmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV; enteric and respiratory). This domain is subject to relaxed selection pressure and an increased rate of molecularevolution. It contains unique amino acid substitutions, including within a regionimportant for sialic acid binding and pathogenesis in TGEV. Overall, the spikegene is extensively recombinant, with a feline coronavirus type II strain servinga prominent role in the recombinant history of the virus. Molecular divergencetime for a segment of the gene where temporal signal could be determined, wasestimated at around 60 years ago. We hypothesize that the virus had an entericorigin, but that it may be losing that particular tropism, possibly because ofmutations in the sialic acid binding region of the spike 0-domain.

TI  - A COVID-19 Vaccine for Dogs Prevents Reverse Zoonosis.
LID - 676 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vaccines10050676 [doi]
AB  - COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome virus type 2(SARS-CoV-2), which can infect both humans and animals. SARS-CoV-2 originatedfrom bats and can affect various species capable of crossing the species barrier due to active mutation. Although reports on reverse zoonosis (human-to-animaltransmission) of SARS-CoV-2 remain limited, reverse zoonosis has been reported inmany species such as cats, tigers, minks, etc. Therefore, transmission to moreanimals cannot be ruled out. Moreover, the wide distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in thehuman population could result in an increased risk of reverse zoonosis. Tocounteract reverse zoonosis, we developed the first COVID-19 subunit vaccines fordogs, which are representative companion animals, and the vaccine includes theSARS-CoV-2 recombinant protein of whole S1 protein and the receptor-bindingdomain (RBD). A subunit vaccine is a vaccine developed by purifying only theprotein region that induces an immune response instead of the whole pathogen.This type of vaccine is safer than the whole virus vaccine because there is norisk of infection and proliferation through back-mutation of the virus. Vaccines were administered to beagles twice at an interval of 3 weeks subcutaneously andantibody formation rates were assessed in serum. We identified a titer,comparable to that of vaccinated people, shown to be sufficient to protectagainst SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the vaccination of companion animals, such asdogs, may prevent reverse zoonosis by protecting animals from SARS-CoV-2; thus,reverse zoonosis of COVID-19 is preventable.

TI  - Seroepidemiology of Toxoplasma gondii Infection in Blood Donors from WesternRomania.
LID - 973 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10050973 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Toxoplasma gondii is estimated to infect 33% of blood donorsworldwide, and seroprevalence varies widely between countries. We aimed toevaluate, for the first time, the seroprevalence and risk factors associated withT. gondii in blood donors from Western Romania. METHODS: Serologic testing todemonstrate the presence of T. gondii antibodies was conducted in 1347 healthyblood donors. Risk factors for T. gondii infection were assessed through anepidemiological questionnaire. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of T. gondiiantibodies was 45.9%, with a significant age-associated increase (p &lt; 0.001)from 32.6% in age group 18-25 years to 67.6% in age group 56-63 years. T. gondii seroprevalence decreased with increasing level of education, from 64.3% inindividuals who graduated from elementary/middle school to 40.4% in those whograduated from University (p &lt; 0.001). The multiple logistic regressionanalysis revealed that age, level of education and having pets (cats and/or dogs)were significantly associated with T. gondii infection. CONCLUSIONS: This studybrings new and valuable data regarding the seroepidemiology of T. gondiiinfection in Romania. Our findings indicate a high prevalence of T. gondiiantibodies in blood donors and may serve as a starting point for furtherepidemiological studies that should lead to implementation of prevention programsfor toxoplasmosis.

TI  - Babesiosis in Southeastern, Central and Northeastern Europe: An Emerging andRe-Emerging Tick-Borne Disease of Humans and Animals.
LID - 945 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10050945 [doi]
AB  - There is now considerable evidence that in Europe, babesiosis is an emerginginfectious disease, with some of the causative species spreading as a consequenceof the increasing range of their tick vector hosts. In this review, we summarize both the historic records and recent findings on the occurrence and incidence of babesiosis in 20 European countries located in southeastern Europe (Bosnia andHerzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia), central Europe (Austria, the Czech Republic,Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Switzerland), andnorthern and northeastern Europe (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Iceland, Denmark,Finland, Sweden, and Norway), identified in humans and selected species ofdomesticated animals (cats, dogs, horses, and cattle). Recorded cases of humanbabesiosis are still rare, but their number is expected to rise in the comingyears. This is because of the widespread and longer seasonal activity of Ixodesricinus as a result of climate change and because of the more extensive use ofbetter molecular diagnostic methods. Bovine babesiosis has a re-emergingpotential because of the likely loss of herd immunity, while canine babesiosis israpidly expanding in central and northeastern Europe, its occurrence correlating with the rapid, successful expansion of the ornate dog tick (Dermacentorreticulatus) populations in Europe. Taken together, our analysis of the availablereports shows clear evidence of an increasing annual incidence of babesiosisacross Europe in both humans and animals that is changing in line with similarincreases in the incidence of other tick-borne diseases. This situation is ofmajor concern, and we recommend more extensive and frequent, standardizedmonitoring using a "One Health" approach.

LID - 10.3390/jof8050469 [doi]
AB  - Although rare, disseminated sporotrichosis is increasing in several countries.Despite its limiting toxic potential, amphotericin B is the only intravenousantifungal available to treat severe sporotrichosis. We aimed to describe theeffectiveness and safety of amphotericin B treatment for severe sporotrichosis.Clinical records of patients with disseminated sporotrichosis at a referencecenter were reviewed. This study included 73 patients. Most (53.4%) were men and non-white. HIV coinfection was the main comorbidity (52.1%). Most reportedcontact with cats (76.7%). Sporothrix brasiliensis was the causative species.Affected sites were skin (98.6%), osteoarticular system (64.4%), upper airway(42.5%), central nervous system (20.5%), eyes (12.3%), and lungs (8.2%). Mediandoses of amphotericin B used were 750 mg and 4500 mg for deoxycholate and lipidcomplex formulations, respectively. Amphotericin B discontinuation occurred in20.5% due to adverse events, mainly azotemia. The outcomes included cure (52.1%),death due to sporotrichosis (21.9%), death due to other causes (9.6%), and lossto follow-up (8.2%). Survival analysis showed an association between cure and theabsence of bone, upper airway, and central nervous system involvement.Amphotericin B is the first-choice treatment for disseminated sporotrichosis;however, the severity of systemic dissemination might predict its response.Favorable clinical results depend on prompt diagnosis, investigation of fungaldissemination, and early therapy initiation.

TI  - Independent COL5A1 Variants in Cats with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.
LID - 797 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13050797 [doi]
AB  - We investigated four cats with similar clinical skin-related signs stronglysuggestive of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Cases no. 1 and 4 were unrelated and the remaining two cases, no. 2 and 3, were reportedly siblings. Histopathologicalchanges were characterized by severely altered dermal collagen fibers.Transmission electron microscopy in one case demonstrated abnormalities in thecollagen fibril organization and structure. The genomes of the two unrelatedaffected cats and one of the affected siblings were sequenced and individuallycompared to 54 feline control genomes. We searched for private protein changingvariants in known human EDS candidate genes and identified three independentheterozygous COL5A1 variants. COL5A1 is a well-characterized candidate gene forclassical EDS. It encodes the proalpha1 chain of type V collagen, which is neededfor correct collagen fibril formation and the integrity of the skin. Theidentified variants in COL5A1 are c.112_118+15del or r.spl?, c.3514A&gt;T orp.(Lys1172*), and c.3066del or p.(Gly1023Valfs*50) for cases no. 1, 2&3, and 4,respectively. They presumably all lead to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, whichresults in haploinsufficiency of COL5A1 and causes the alterations of theconnective tissue. The whole genome sequencing approach used in this studyenables a refinement of the diagnosis for the affected cats as classical EDS. It further illustrates the potential of such experiments as a precision medicineapproach in animals with inherited diseases.

TI  - Cats with Genetic Variants of AGXT2 Respond Differently to a Dietary InterventionKnown to Reduce the Risk of Calcium Oxalate Stone Formation.
LID - 791 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13050791 [doi]
AB  - This study was completed to evaluate a genotype-specific nutritional interventionfor reducing the risk of calcium oxalate stone formation. Serum metabolomicprofiles and genotypes of 445 cats in the colony at Hill's Pet Nutrition, Inc(Topeka, KS, USA)were assessed in a genome-wide association study, and revealedan association between genetic variants of alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase 2 (AGXT2) and 2-oxoarginine. The most significant single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNP) associated with 2-oxoarginine was at position chrA1:212069607, [G/A] (p&lt; 3.687 x 10(-17)). This SNP explained approximately 15% of the variance in2-oxoarginine concentrations. The distribution of genotype frequencies was 0.07AA, 0.39 AG, and 0.54 GG, with a mean relative 2-oxoarginine concentration foreach genotype of 0.45 AA, 0.92 AG, and 1.27 GG, indicating a subtractive effectof the minor allele (A). Serum concentrations of two AGXT2 substrates,symmetric/asymmetric dimethylarginines (SDMA/ADMA) and beta-aminoisobutyrate(BAIB) were also strongly associated with SNP chrA1:212069607 (p &lt; 1.43 x10(-12) and p &lt; 2.30 x 10(-14), respectively). These two AGXT2 substrates wereincreased with the minor allele (A), indicating that the variant of the AGXT2gene results in decreased aminotransferase activity. Additionally, the lifetimehistory of stone incidence showed that cats with the AA variant of AGXT2 SNP had a 2.515x increased incidence of stones compared with cats having the GG variant(p = 0.019). In a subsequent study assessing AGXT2 genotypes, cats (n = 10 GG, 4 AG, 9 AA) were fed control or test food (containing betaine at 0.500%, and thebotanicals green tea, fenugreek and tulsi at 0.25, 0.025, and 0.0015%,respectively) in a cross-over study design. Stone risk analysis was conducted on urine samples after feeding control or test food for 28 days each. A calciumoxalate titration test (COT) was performed to assess the amount of added Ox(-2)(per L) required to initiate calcium oxalate crystal formation. Cats with the GG variant of the AGXT2 SNP required more added oxalate to initiate urine crystalformation after consuming test food compared with control food, indicating adecreased risk of oxalate crystal formation in GG cats. In addition, urineoxalate concentrations showed an overall effect of test food independent ofgenotype (p = 0.0009), which resulted in lower oxalate concentrations afterconsuming test food compared with control food. These data indicate that catswith the GG-specific variant of AGXT2 should benefit from a reduced risk ofcalcium oxalate stone formation after consuming a betaine and botanical dietaryenhancement.

TI  - A Common Missense Variant Causing Factor XI Deficiency and Increased BleedingTendency in Maine Coon Cats.
LID - 792 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13050792 [doi]
AB  - Hereditary factor XI (FXI) deficiency is characterized as an autosomal mild tomoderate coagulopathy in humans and domestic animals. Coagulation testingrevealed FXI deficiency in a core family of Maine Coon cats (MCCs) in the United States. Factor XI-deficient MCCs were homozygous for a guanine to adeninetransition resulting in a methionine substitution for the highly conservedvaline-516 in the FXI catalytic domain. Immunoblots detected FXI of normal sizeand quantity in plasmas of MCCs homozygous for V516M. Some FXI-deficient MCCsexperienced excessive post-operative/traumatic bleeding. Screening of 263 MCCs inEurope revealed a mutant allele frequency of 0.232 (23.2%). However, V516M wasnot found among 100 cats of other breeds. Recombinant feline FXI-M516 (fFXI-M516)expressed ~4% of the activity of wild-type fFXI-V516 in plasma clotting assays.Furthermore, fFXIa-M516 cleaved the chromogenic substrate S-2366 with ~4.3-foldlower catalytic efficacy (kcat/Km) than fFXIa-V516, supporting a conformationalalteration of the protease active site. The rate of FIX activation by fFXIa-M516 was reduced &gt;3-fold compared with fFXIa-V516. The common missense variantFXI-V516M causes a cross-reactive material positive FXI deficiency in MCCs thatis associated with mild-moderate bleeding tendencies. Given the prevalence of thevariant in MCCs, genotyping is recommended prior to invasive procedures orbreeding.

TI  - Prevalence and Genomic Investigation of Multidrug-Resistant Salmonella Isolatesfrom Companion Animals in Hangzhou, China.
LID - 625 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antibiotics11050625 [doi]
AB  - Salmonella is a group of bacteria that constitutes the leading cause of diarrhealdiseases, posing a great disease burden worldwide. There are numerous pathwaysfor zoonotic Salmonella transmission to humans; however, the role of companionanimals in spreading these bacteria is largely underestimated in China. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of Salmonella in pet dogs and cats in Hangzhou,China, and characterize the antimicrobial resistance profile and genetic featuresof these pet-derived pathogens. In total, 137 fecal samples of pets werecollected from an animal hospital in Hangzhou in 2018. The prevalence ofSalmonella was 5.8% (8/137) in pets, with 9.3% (5/54) of cats and 3.6% (3/83) of dogs being Salmonella positive. By whole-genome sequencing (WGS), in silicoserotyping, and multilocus sequence typing (MLST), 26 pet-derived Salmonellaisolates were identified as Salmonella Dublin (ST10, n = 22) and SalmonellaTyphimurium (ST19, n = 4). All of the isolates were identified as beingmultidrug-resistant (MDR), by conducting antimicrobial susceptibility testingunder both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The antibiotics of the mostprevalent resistance were streptomycin (100%), cotrimoxazole (100%), tetracycline(96.20%), and ceftriaxone (92.30%). Versatile antimicrobial-resistant genes were identified, including floR (phenicol-resistant gene), blaCTX-M-15, andblaCTX-M-55 (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genes). A total of 11 incompatible (Inc) plasmids were identified, with IncA/C2, IncFII(S), and IncX1 being the mostpredominant among Salmonella Dublin, and IncFIB(S), IncFII(S), IncI1, and IncQ1being the most prevailing among Salmonella Typhimurium. Our study applied WGS to characterize pet-derived Salmonella in China, showing the presence of MDRSalmonella in pet dogs and cats with a high diversity of ARGs and plasmids. Thesedata indicate a necessity for the regular surveillance of pet-derived pathogensto mitigate zoonotic diseases.

LID - 10.3390/ani12101310 [doi]
AB  - Carbapenem and colistin are important antibiotics for the treatment of infectionscaused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. Here, we isolated theblaNDM-5-harboring Escherichia coli in companion animals in healthy or diseasedcompanion animals from veterinary clinics in six cities in China from July toNovember 2016. A total of 129 rectal swabs of healthy or diseased dogs and catswere collected from veterinary clinics in six different cities in China, and the isolates were subjected to carbapenem and colistin susceptibility testing.Resistance genes were confirmed using PCR. Conjugation experiments were conductedto determine the transferability of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in thestrains. The isolated rate of blaNDM-5-harboring E. coli strains was 3.88% (five strains). These five strains were multidrug resistant to at least threeantibiotics and corresponded to four sequence types including ST101. The blaNDM-5gene was located on 46 kb IncX3 plasmids in these five strains, and the geneticcontexts were shared and were nearly identical to the K. pneumoniae plasmidpNDM5-IncX3 from China. In addition, one strain (CQ6-1) co-harboredblaNDM-5-encoding-IncX3 plasmid along with a mcr-1-encoding-IncX4 plasmid, andtheir corresponding genetic environments were identical to the blaNDM-5-IncX3 andmcr-1-IncX4 hybrid plasmid reported previously from the same area and from thesame clinic. The results indicated that the similar genetic contexts were shared between these isolates from companion animals, and the IncX3-type plasmids playeda key role in the spread of blaNDM-5 among these bacteria.

AB  - The olfactory mucosa contains olfactory ecto-mesenchymal stem cells (OE-MSCs)which show stemness features, multipotency capabilities, and have a therapeuticpotential. The OE-MSCs have already been collected and isolated from variousmammals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of collecting,purifying and amplifying OE-MSCs from the cat nasal cavity. Four cats wereincluded in the study. Biopsies of olfactory mucosa were performed onanesthetized animals. Then, the olfactory OE-MSCs were isolated, and theirstemness features as well as their mesodermal differentiation capabilities werecharacterized. Olfactory mucosa biopsies were successfully performed in allsubjects. From these biopsies, cellular populations were rapidly generated,presenting various stemness features, such as a fibroblast-like morphology,nestin and MAP2 expression, and sphere and colony formation. These cells coulddifferentiate into neural and mesodermal lineages. This report shows for thefirst time that the isolation of OE-MSCs from cat olfactory mucosa is possible.These cells showed stemness features and multilineage differentiationcapabilities, indicating they may be a promising tool for autologous grafts andfeline regenerative medicine.

TI  - Short Communication: Use of Infrared Thermometers for Cutaneous TemperatureRecording: Agreement with the Rectal Temperature in Felis catus.
LID - 1275 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12101275 [doi]
AB  - In veterinary medicine, the gold standard for assessing body temperature isrectal temperature assessment. Considering that this procedure is stressful formany species, in particular for cats, it could be clinically important toconsider an alternative approach for the monitoring of core body temperature. Theaim of this study was to test if cutaneous temperature measurements by means ofdifferent infrared thermometers are in agreement with the most commonly usedmethod for body temperature measurement in cats. The cutaneous temperature wasrecorded in the jugular, shoulder, rib, flank, and inner thigh, using threedifferent non-contact infrared thermometers (IR1, IR2, and IR3) in 20 cats. Thecutaneous temperature was then compared to the rectal temperature, recorded bymeans of a digital thermometer. The obtained data indicated that the cutaneoustemperature recorded by the infrared thermometers was not in agreement with thedata recorded by the digital thermometer in the rectum. In cats, the use ofnon-contact infrared thermometers gave no reproducible or constant data tojustify their application for the recording of body temperature instead of rectaltemperature recording. In addition, the infrared temperature measurement devices generated results that were not in good agreement among themselves, providing anovel result of clinical importance.

TI  - Role of Erythrocytes in Nitric Oxide Metabolism and Paracrine Regulation ofEndothelial Function.
LID - 943 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antiox11050943 [doi]
AB  - Emerging studies provide new data shedding some light on the complex and pivotal role of red blood cells (RBCs) in nitric oxide (NO) metabolism and paracrineregulation of endothelial function. NO is involved in the regulation ofvasodilatation, platelet aggregation, inflammation, hypoxic adaptation, andoxidative stress. Even though tremendous knowledge about NO metabolism has beencollected, the exact RBCs' status still requires evaluation. This papersummarizes the actual knowledge regarding the role of erythrocytes as a mobiledepot of amino acids necessary for NO biotransformation. Moreover, the complexregulation of RBCs' translocases is presented with a particular focus on cationicamino acid transporters (CATs) responsible for the NO substrates and derivatives transport. The main part demonstrates the intraerythrocytic metabolism ofL-arginine with its regulation by reactive oxygen species and arginase activity. Additionally, the process of nitrite and nitrate turnover was demonstrated to be another stable source of NO, with its reduction by xanthine oxidoreductase orhemoglobin. Additional function of hemoglobin in NO synthesis and its subsequent stabilization in steady intermediates is also discussed. Furthermore, RBCsregulate the vascular tone by releasing ATP, inducing smooth muscle cellrelaxation, and decreasing platelet aggregation. Erythrocytes andintraerythrocytic NO metabolism are also responsible for the maintenance ofnormotension. Hence, RBCs became a promising new therapeutic target in restoring NO homeostasis in cardiovascular disorders.

TI  - Molecular and serological evaluation of visceral leishmaniasis in domestic dogsand cats in Maragheh County, north-west of Iran, 2018-2021.
LID - 10.1002/vms3.846 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is caused by Leishmania infantum,of which dogs are the main reservoir. VL is endemic in the Middle East, also insome parts of Iran. Following reports of new cases of VL in children in Maragheh County, the non-endemic area of the disease, we encouraged to conduct apreliminary study on domestic dogs and cats to identify their potential role asreservoirs for the disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conductedduring a period of 3 years from 2018 to 2021. Two hundred ownership dogs and 25cats from Maragheh County, north-west of Iran, were randomly screened. Bloodsamples were collected. A direct agglutination test (DAT) was used for thedetection of anti-L. infantum antibodies. Furthermore, buffy coat samples fromthe L. infantum seropositive animals were examined to detect parasite presenceusing polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Out of the total of 200 ownership dogs evaluated, 170 (85%) were male and 30 (15%) were female with a mean age of 4.3years. Anti-L. infantum antibodies (IgG cut-off >/= 1:320) were observed in 3.5% of dogs (7/200) by the DAT test. All seropositive dogs were identified in thefirst year of examination. Regarding molecular approaches in seropositive dogs,two samples were positive for a 565 bp kDNA minicircle gene specific for L.infantum. During the study period, no seropositive case was detected in the cats examined. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the domestic cycle of L. infantumhas been established in the studied region. It is necessary to increase theawareness and monitoring of the disease with the study of wild reservoirsperiodically.

LID - 10.3390/vetsci9050237 [doi]
AB  - With the development of 3D printing and surgical techniques, various defectreconstruction methods after tumor resection have been applied not only in humansbut also in veterinary medicine. This report describes a case of reconstructionafter hemipelvectomy for an osteoma in a cat using a 3D-printed pelvicendoprosthesis and micro total hip replacement (mTHR). A 5-year-old spayed femaleTurkish Angora cat was referred for a 1-month history of constipation andintermittent weight-bearing lameness in the left hindlimb. An osteoma in thepelvis measuring 4.5 x 3 x 5.4 cm was identified based on diagnosticexaminations. A left mid-to-caudal partial and right caudal partialhemipelvectomy, and a left femoral head and neck osteotomy, were planned toremove the mass. Reconstruction of the bone defect using 3D-printed metalendoprosthesis and mTHR in the left hindlimb was intended. During right caudalpartial hemipelvectomy, right femoral head and neck osteotomy was performedbecause there was infiltration in the medial wall of the acetabulum.Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of an osteoma. Two weekspost-surgery, surgical debridement and femoral stem removal were performedbecause of delayed wound healing and sciatic neurapraxia, leading to femoral stemdislocation from the cup. The delayed wound healing and sciatic neurapraxia were appropriately addressed. The cat regained normal weight and defecation 4 weekspost-operatively. Two years post-surgery, the patient recovered with an almostnormal gait. Hemipelvectomy with 3D-printed endoprosthesis provides a safesurgical option with favorable outcomes for neoplasms in the pelvis of cats.

TI  - Prevalence of Toxocara Eggs in Public Parks in the City of Valencia (EasternSpain).
LID - 232 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vetsci9050232 [doi]
AB  - Toxocara spp. is one of the most common zoonotic geohelminths in the world. Itsinfections are associated with the accidental ingestion of contaminated soil and affecting, especially children. In this study, feces, and soil samples from 14public parks in the city of Valencia were analyzed. The Telemann method and amodified version of a sieving technique were used to process feces and soil,respectively. None of the fecal samples and 10.9% of soil samples from five parks(35.7%) tested positive for the presence of Toxocara eggs. The most contaminated areas were the canine sanitary parks (30.8% of the samples), followed bysocialization areas for dogs (9.7%); no positive samples were found at children'splaygrounds. Our results suggest that most pets in Valencia are periodicallydewormed, although additional preventive measures should be applied, since therisk of infection exists probably due to the presence of stray dogs and feralcats.

TI  - Helicobacter spp. in the Stomach of Cats: Successful Colonization and Absence of Relevant Histopathological Alterations Reveals High Adaptation to the HostGastric Niche.
LID - 228 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vetsci9050228 [doi]
AB  - In addition to Helicobacter pylori, many non-Helicobacter pylori Helicobacters(NHPH) are able to cause gastric disease in humans. Cats are a natural reservoir for many of these species. Accordingly, living in close and intimate contact withanimals has been identified as a risk factor, and an important zoonoticsignificance has therefore been attributed to NHPH. To determine the prevalenceand associated gastric histopathological changes of Helicobacter species, thegastric mucosa of 71 cats were evaluated. Only four presented normalhistopathological mucosa with the absence of spiral-shaped organisms. Normalgastric mucosa and the presence of spiral-shaped bacteria were observed in 13cats. The remaining animals presented histopathological changes representative ofgastritis. Helicobacter species were detected in 53 cats (74.6%) by at least one detection method. None of the animals were positive for H. pylori or for H.ailurogastricus. Helicobacter heilmannii organisms were identified in 20 animals,predominantly in the body gastric region. Helicobacter salomonis was the secondmost prevalent species (57.1%), although it was mainly found in association with other NHPH. Helicobacter felis and H. bizzozeronii were less frequently detected.The great majority of the Helicobacter spp. PCR-positive animals presented normalfeatures regarding fibrosis/mucosal atrophy, neutrophils, eosinophils, or otherinflammatory cells and lymphofollicular hyperplasia. Given the controversy andthe strong evidence of absence of significant histopathological alterationsassociated with the presence of Helicobacter spp. in cats, it is possible tohypothesize that these bacteria may be able to adapt to the feline gastricmicroenvironment or even to comprise part of the gastric microbiome of thisanimal species. Thus, prudency must be taken when prescribing an antibiotictherapy based solely on the presence of these bacteria in the feline stomach.

AB  - Introduction: Mycotic aortic aneurysm is defined as dilatation of the aortic walldue to infection caused by a variety of microorganisms and is associated withhigh mortality rates. This case report describes a patient with a rapid growingmycotic infrarenal aneurysm caused by Capnocytophaga canimorsus following a dogbite. Report: A 61 year old male professional dog handler presented with ahistory of progressive abdominal pain and constitutional symptoms. He had beenbitten by a Pit Bull Terrier dog that was attacking a young girl three weeksprior to the onset of complaints. Investigations revealed a mycotic infrarenalaortic aneurysm that grew 0.5 cm in only three days. Open surgical repairconsisting of an infrarenal aorto-aortic bypass with a 21 mm x 15 cm bovinebioprosthesis was performed successfully. All cultures and biopsies were negativeand the subsequent 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region based polymerase chainreaction (IS-pro) technique revealed C. canimorsus, a Gram negative bacterialpathogen that lives as a commensal in the gingival flora of dogs and cats thatcan cause a variety of severe infections, as the causative agent. Identification made it possible to treat the patient with eight weeks of intravenous followed byfour weeks of oral antibiotics. At the last follow up over a year after surgery, the patient was symptom free, without infection and on ultrasound examinationthere were no signs of complications or aneurysm formation. Discussion: This casehighlights C. canimorsus as a rare cause of a rapid growing mycotic aorticaneurysm following a dog bite. 16S-23S rRNA profiling (IS-pro) led to theidentification of the bacterial pathogen. The use of biological grafts should be considered in the management of mycotic aortic aneurysms.

PG  - e24414
LID - 10.7759/cureus.24414 [doi]
AB  - Cats and dogs make up an essential part of the household for families in theUnited States. Close contact with pets can carry a risk of potential infectiousdisease transmission. This case series outlines causes of zoonotic pneumoniaassociated with cats and dogs, with a particular focus on the three casespresented of respiratory infection with Bordetella (B.) bronchiseptica andPasteurella (P.) multocida in patients with an underlying malignancy. B.bronchiseptica is a rare bacterial pathogen in humans that can cause disease inimmunocompromised individuals. Interpreting the significance of B. bronchisepticaas a pathogenic agent can be challenging given that this microbe oftenaccompanies other organisms in culture. P. multocida is another importantpathogen known to cause severe respiratory infection in immunocompromisedpopulations or those with certain underlying comorbidities. A broadeneddifferential for other bacterial etiologies of zoonotic respiratory infectionacquired from dogs or cats includes Francisella tularensis, Yersinia pestis,Coxiella burnetii, and Bartonella henselae. These pathogens should be considered in the correct clinical context. Pets also play a role as reservoirs for thetransmission of resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcusaureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus intermedius group (SIG), and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae.Immunocompromised individuals must be educated on the potential for householdtransmission of zoonotic disease and how to limit certain types of close contact with pets. This report also highlights the importance of flea and tick control inpets for the prevention of zoonotic disease spread.

TI  - KOREAN AEROALLERGEN SENSITIZATION STATUS FROM 2018-2021.
LID - 10.21053/ceo.2022.00248 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: To date, studies on the aeroallergen sensitization status of Koreans based on large-scale data are lacking. Methods: We analyzed the data for 368,156 multiple allergosorbent tests (MAST) collected by a domestic medical diagnosiscompany from 3,735 hospitals nationwide from 2018 to 2021. We additionallycollected sex, age, and regional data. If the level of an aeroallergen was 0.35IU/mL or more, it was defined as positive, and if one aeroallergen was positive, it was defined as a positive case. The positive ratio (PR) for aeroallergens was calculated only for positive cases. Results: A total of 347,996 cases wereanalyzed, excluding cases with missing data. The percentage of positive cases was56.7%, which was high in adolescents (74.1%) and low in the elderly (47.0%). All four types of mites had high PRs (0.382-0.655), and mold had low PRs(0.023-0.058). Among pollens, the PR of grass was generally high (more than0.14), followed by weeds (approximately 0.10), and in the case of wood, it wasless than 0.1. For animals, cats and dogs had the highest values at 0.231 and0.183, respectively. The value for cockroaches was also high, at 0.211. The PRsof indoor aeroallergens, such as mites, molds, and animals, were high inadolescents, and those of pollen and cockroaches were high in the elderly. InJeju, the PR of the Japanese cedars was extremely high (0.222). Conclusion:Koreans are sensitized to a wide variety of aeroallergens. There were significantdifferences in sensitization patterns according to age or region.

PG  - 93
LID - 10.1186/s12985-022-01816-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Phylogenetic studies indicate bats as original hosts of SARS-CoV-2.However, it remains unclear whether other animals, including pets, are crucial inthe spread and maintenance of COVID-19 worldwide. METHODS: In this study, weanalyzed the first fatal case of a SARS-CoV-2 and FeLV co-infection in aneight-year-old male cat. We carried out a clinical evaluation and severallaboratory analyses. RESULTS: As main results, we observed an animal presentingsevere acute respiratory syndrome and lesions in several organs, which led to theanimal's death. RT-qPCR analysis showed a SARS-CoV-2 as the causative agent. The virus was detected in several organs, indicating a multisystemic infection. Thevirus was found in a high load in the trachea, suggesting that the animal mayhave contribute to the transmission of the virus. The whole-genome sequencingrevealed an infection by SARS-CoV-2 Gamma VOC (P.1), and any mutations indicatinghost adaptation were observed. CONCLUSION: Our data show that FeLV-positive cats are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and raise questions about the potentialof immunocompromised FeLV-positive cats to act as a reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 new variants.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of isavuconazole in healthy cats after oral and intravenousadministration.
PG  - 1422-1429
LID - 10.1111/jvim.16452 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Isavuconazole is a triazole antifungal drug that has shown goodefficacy in human patients. Absorption and pharmacokinetics have not beenevaluated in cats. OBJECTIVES: To determine the pharmacokinetics of isavuconazolein cats given a single IV or PO dose. ANIMALS: Eight healthy, adult researchcats. METHODS: Four cats received 100 mg capsules of isavuconazole PO. Four cats received 5 mg/kg isavuconazole solution IV. Serum was collected at predetermined intervals for analysis using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Data were analyzed using a 2-compartment uniform weightingpharmacokinetic analysis with lag time for PO administration and a 2 compartment,1/y(2) weighting for IV administration. Predicted 24 and 48-hour dosing intervalsof 100 mg isavuconazole administered PO were modeled and in vitro plasma protein binding was assessed. RESULTS: Both PO and IV drug administration resulted inhigh serum concentrations. Intravenous and PO formulations of isavuconazoleappear to be able to be used interchangeably. Peak serum isavuconazoleconcentrations occurred 5 +/- 3.8 hours after PO administration with anelimination rate half-life of 66.2 +/- 55.3 hours. Intersubject variability wasapparent in both the PO and IV groups. Two cats vomited 6 to 8 hours after POadministration. No adverse effects were observed in the IV group. Oralbioavailability was estimated to be approximately 88%. Serum protein binding was calculated to be approximately 99.0% +/- 0.03%. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICALIMPORTANCE: Isavuconazole might prove to be useful in cats with fungal diseasegiven its favorable pharmacokinetics. Additional studies on safety, efficacy, andtolerability of long-term isavuconazole use are needed.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to evaluate and compare the effects that dexmedetomidine and methadone, either alone or in combination, have on the ocularvariables of healthy adult cats when administered intramuscularly, as well astheir reversal with atipamezole. METHODS: A randomized crossover blinded study of10 healthy cats was used to assess the effect of 0.2 mg/kg methadone (MET), 7.5mug/kg dexmedetomidine (D7), 10 mug/kg dexmedetomidine (D10), 7.5 mug/kgdexmedetomidine and 0.2 mg/kg methadone (DM7) and 10 mug/kg dexmedetomidine and0.2 mg/kg methadone (DM10) on intraocular pressure (IOP), tear production andpupil diameter (PD). The animals were evaluated for 30 mins. Afterwards,atipamezole was administered and ocular variables were evaluated for 30 mins.RESULTS: D10, DM7 and DM10 significantly decreased mean IOP but MET or D7 didnot. Tear production decreased significantly in all treatments, corresponding to 18%, 59%, 63%, 86% and 98% in MET, D7, D10, DM7 and DM10, respectively. PDincreased in all treatments, but MET showed the highest PD. Thirty minutes after atipamezole (RT30), IOP returned to baseline with no difference between groups,and there was a significant increase in tear production, but the means were stilldifferent from baseline. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Dexmedetomidine decreases IOPand tear production but increases PD in healthy cats. Atipamezole can partlyreverse those alterations. Low-dose dexmedetomidine (7.5 microg/kg) promotessedation without changing the IOP. All protocols significantly decrease tearproduction, and Schirmer tear test after sedation is not representative ofnon-sedated values. Methadone induces quick onset mydriasis without changing the IOP.

TI  - Quality of life and response to treatment in cats with hypersomatotropism: theowners' point of view.
PG  - e175-e182
LID - 10.1177/1098612X221098718 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to collect clinical information from ownersof cats with hypersomatotropism (HS) distributed worldwide, assessing the impact of HS and its treatments on cats' quality of life (QoL) and survival time.METHODS: A survey focused on clinical presentation, diagnostic procedures,treatments, cats' QoL and disease progression was distributed worldwide to ownersof cats with HS. The owner's perception of the cats' QoL before and after orduring treatment was defined using a score ranging from 1 (poor) to 5(excellent). Improvement following treatment (IFT) was quantified using a scoreranging from 1 (absent) to 5 (obvious). Different treatment groups, including at least five cases, were compared. RESULTS: A total of 127 cats were included from at least 11 different countries. Among these, 120 (95%) were diabetic and 7 (5%) were not. Out of 120 diabetic cats, 55 (46%) were treated with insulin as asingle treatment (INS). Other treatments were not mentioned to owners in 35/120(29%) cases. The median QoL score at diagnosis was 2 (range 1-5) and improvedafter treatment in all groups. Cabergoline (4; range 1-5), radiotherapy (4; range2-5) and hypophysectomy (5; range 4-5) showed better median IFT scores comparedwith INS (3; range 1-5) (P = 0.046, P <0.002 and P <0.0001, respectively).Hypophysectomy IFT proved superior to cabergoline (P = 0.047) and was equal toradiotherapy IFT (P = 0.32). No difference was found between cabergoline andradiotherapy IFT (P = 0.99). The median survival time (MST) was 24 months (range 0-75 months). Cats treated with INS showed shorter MST (22 months; range 0-69months) compared with cats treated with causal treatments combined (36 months;range 3-75 months) (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Not all cats with HSwill have diabetes mellitus. Causal treatments seem associated with the greatest improvements in perceived cats' QoL and survival; such treatments shouldtherefore be discussed with owners. Cabergoline could be an effective alternativemanagement option.

TI  - Welfare worries: a preliminary, cross-sectional study of general practice, small animal veterinarians perceptions and management of canine and feline behaviourproblems.
LID - 10.1111/avj.13168 [doi]
AB  - Behavioural disease is one of the leading reasons for euthanasia in shelter dogs and cats. Information acquired via a survey of veterinarians (n = 59) was used tounderstand the way canine and feline behaviour problems are viewed and managed bynonshelter, small animal general practice veterinarians. Participants (20%, n =12) felt that the following diseases were more of a welfare issue than behaviour problems: food sensitivity, osteoarthritis, puppy/kitten farms, skin disease,nutritional disease, parasitic disease, dental disease, obesity, in-breeding,over-population, neoplasia, greyhound racing, hyperthyroidism and renal disease. Behaviour problems in dogs and cats were not ranked in the top four welfareproblems by 40% (n = 23) of respondents. Behaviour case follow-up was poorer thanphysical health case follow-up. Respondents (20%, n = 12) felt that veterinariansshould 'possibly' be able to identify behaviour problems in dogs and cats, and54% (n = 32) felt that this was 'absolutely' their professional responsibility.Twelve percent (n = 7) would reschedule behaviour appointments that had beenbooked in for them. Behaviour was more likely to be seen as a welfare issue bymore experienced veterinarians and also, those with shelter experience. Half ofrespondents felt reluctant to discuss behaviour problems with clients because of deficiencies in behaviour knowledge. Eighty percent (n = 47) felt their educationequipped them poorly or extremely poorly in dealing with behaviour problems indogs and cats. Consideration should be given for the inclusion of adequatebehavioural medicine content in veterinary medicine curriculum to allow forgraduates to possess a basic level of training and competency in this discipline.

AB  - Recently, there has been an increasing movement of germinal products of dogs(Canis lupus familiaris) and cats (Felis silvestris catus) between the MemberStates. Therefore, Europe laid down and harmonized rules on the marking of strawsand other packages containing germinal products [Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/686]. Given that germinal products' movement may increase the risk ofinfectious disease spread, requirements regarding animal health have been revisedfocusing on control of rabies and echinococcosis, although there are new emergingdiseases that may require, even locally, specific requirements. For this reason, veterinarians, operators, and official veterinarians are involved in differentphases of the process. Because non-veterinary operators can operate in allphases, they should have a limited role in collecting germinal products,especially for feline species. Veterinarians, instead, should have a main role inthe health evaluation of donors, in collecting germ cells with medical techniquesand in depositing sperm and embryos with endoscopic or surgical methods. Theofficial veterinarians are the main ones responsible for the application of therules. This paper aims to provide an overview of the European legislativeframework regarding the newly delegated regulation on germinal products in small animals (dogs and cats), highlighting some of the benefits and critical aspectsregarding its functioning.

AB  - Purpose: To determine the comparative efficacy of ganciclovir ophthalmic gel and famciclovir oral tablets in cats with experimentally induced ocular felineherpesvirus-1 (FHV-1) epithelial infection. Methods: A randomized,placebo-controlled trial was performed using 16 nonvaccinated, specificpathogen-free cats with experimental FHV-1 infection induced by topical ocularinoculation. Cats received topical ganciclovir 0.15% ophthalmic gel (1 drop 3times daily, n = 6 cats), oral famciclovir (90 mg/kg twice daily, n = 6), ortopical artificial tear gel (1 drop 3 times daily, n = 4) for 14 days. Cats were monitored after inoculation for 30 days. Ophthalmic examinations were performedevery 2 days and ocular disease scores calculated. In vivo confocal microscopywas performed, and corneal leukocyte infiltrates quantified. Ocular samples forFHV-1 quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and virus isolation assayswere collected every 3 days. Hemograms and serum biochemistry panels wereperformed at intervals. Results: Clinical ocular disease scores and cornealleukocyte infiltrates were significantly lower in the ganciclovir and famciclovirgroups compared with placebo, but no significant differences were detectedbetween the antiviral treatment groups. Ocular viral loads determined by qPCRwere significantly lower in the ganciclovir group compared with the placebogroup, but there were no significant differences between the other study groups. Hemograms and biochemistry panels were unremarkable. Conclusion: Topicalapplication of ganciclovir gel 3 times daily was well-tolerated and displayedsimilar efficacy at reducing clinical ocular disease scores and cornealinflammation as twice daily oral famciclovir treatment in cats with experimental ocular FHV-1 infection.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the outer retinal band thickness and choriocapillaris (CC)visibility in four distinct retinal regions in dogs and cats imaged with spectraldomain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). To attempt delineation of afovea-like region in canine and feline SD-OCT scans, aided by the identification of outer retinal thickness differences between retinal regions. METHODS:Spectralis(R) HRA + OCT SD-OCT scans from healthy, anesthetized dogs (n = 10) andcats (n = 12) were analyzed. Scanlines on which the CC was identifiable werecounted and CC visibility was scored. Outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness and thedistances from external limiting membrane (ELM) to retinal pigmentepithelium/Bruch's membrane complex (RPE/BM) and ELM to CC were measured in thearea centralis (AC), a visually identified fovea-like region, and in regionssuperior and inferior to the optic nerve head (ONH). Measurements were analyzedusing a multilevel regression. RESULTS: The CC was visible in over 90% ofscanlines from dogs and cats. The ONL was consistently thinnest in the fovea-likeregion. The outer retina (ELM-RPE and ELM-CC) was thickest within the AC comparedwith superior and inferior to the ONH in dogs and cats (p < .001 for allcomparisons). CONCLUSIONS: The CC appears a valid, albeit less than ideal outerretinal boundary marker in tapetal species. The AC can be objectivelydifferentiated from the surrounding retina on SD-OCT images of dogs and cats; afovea-like region was identified in dogs and its presence was suggested in cats. These findings allow targeted imaging and image evaluation of these regions ofretinal specialization.

PG  - 5198-5211
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0664-21.2022 [doi]
AB  - We studied the changes that neuronal receptive field (RF) models undergo when thestatistics of the stimulus are changed from those of white Gaussian noise (WGN)to those of natural scenes (NSs), by fitting the models to multielectrode datarecorded from primary visual cortex (V1) of female cats. This allowed theestimation of both a cascade of linear filters on the stimulus, as well as thestatic nonlinearities that map the output of the filters to the neuronal spikerates. We found that cells respond differently to these two classes of stimuli,with mostly higher spike rates and shorter response latencies to NSs than to WGN.The most striking finding was that NSs resulted in RFs that had additionaluncovered filters compared with WGN. This finding was not an artifact of thehigher spike rates observed for NSs relative to WGN, but rather was related to a change in coding. Our results reveal a greater extent of nonlinear processing in V1 neurons when stimulated using NSs compared with WGN. Our findings indicate theexistence of nonlinear mechanisms that endow V1 neurons with context-dependenttransmission of visual information.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT This study addresses a fundamental question about the concept of the receptive field (RF): does theencoding of information depend on the context or statistical regularities of the stimulus type? We applied state-of-the-art RF modeling techniques to datacollected from multielectrode recordings from cat visual cortex in response totwo statistically distinct stimulus types: white Gaussian noise and naturalscenes. We find significant differences between the RFs that emerge from ourdata-driven modeling. Natural scenes result in far more complex RFs that combine multiple features in the visual input. Our findings reveal that different regimesor modes of operation are at work in visual cortical processing depending on the information present in the visual input. The complexity of V1 neural codingappears to be dependent on the complexity of the stimulus. We believe this newfinding will have interesting implications for our understanding of the efficienttransmission of information in sensory systems, which is an integral assumptionof many computational theories (e.g., efficient and predictive coding of sensory processing in the brain).

AB  - To conveniently replace worn cutterhead tools in complicated strata, a novelcutterhead attitude control mechanism was recently designed. Meanwhile, themechanism also causes an engineering problem of how to control a matchingcutterhead anti-torque system (CATS) effectively, which is used to prevent adrive box of the cutterhead from rotation during a complex excavation process. Inthis paper, a disturbance observer-based adaptive position controller is proposedfor the CATS. The proposed method presents a nonlinear adaptive controller withadaptation laws to compensate for the unknown time-varying load torque anddamping uncertainty in the system. Based on the disturbance observer method andsliding mode control, an asymptotically stable controller proven by Lyapunovtheory is constructed using the back-stepping technique. In addition, a virtualtest rig based on MATLAB and AMESim co-simulation is built to verify the validityof the proposed controller. The simulation results show that the proposed method has good performance for tracking tasks in the presence of uncertainties comparedwith PID control. Together, the data support targeting disturbance observer-basedadaptive position control as a potential control strategy for cutterheadanti-torque systems.

AB  - Cats with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a decreased ability to maintain body weight. As CKD advances, loss of body weight contributes to morbidity andmortality. The goal of this study was to evaluate the combined effects of feedingbetaine and prebiotics on body weight of both CKD and healthy cats. The pre-trialfood (control food) was a complete and balanced dry food designed to aid in themanagement of CKD. Test food was the control food supplemented with betaine(0.500%) and prebiotics: long-chain oat beta-glucan (0.586%) and 0.407% shortchain fructooligosaccharides (scFOS). The CKD cats (n = 7) were fed pre-trialfood for 28 days and then randomly assigned to control food or test food. Eachfood was fed for 8 weeks in a cross-over study design. In a second study, healthycats received control food or test food for 8 weeks (n = 8 each group). Blood,urine, and fecal samples were collected to evaluate concentrations of relevantkidney function biomarkers and metabolites at the end of each feeding period for CKD cats, and blood samples were collected monthly to evaluate concentrations of plasma metabolites for healthy cats. Body weight and composition were measuredusing dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan at baseline and after eachfeeding period. Total body mass was significantly higher in CKD cats afterconsuming test food compared with control food (P = 0.004), with no significantdifference in food intake while consuming test or control food (P = 0.34). Testfood did not affect total body mass or composition of healthy cats. Indolecompounds produced by bacterial metabolism were decreased in urine and increased in feces of CKD cats fed test food, and plasma concentrations were negativelycorrelated with the level of kidney function, indicating a potential benefit ofconsuming test food. In healthy cats, consuming test food resulted insignificantly decreased concentrations of plasma P-cresol sulfate (P = 0.004) andincreased concentrations of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; both P < 0.05), despite the fact that both control and test foods hadsimilar concentrations of these long-chain fatty acids, 0.03% and 0.02%,respectively. These results suggest that the addition of betaine and prebioticsto the control food formula may have increased total body mass in CKD cats byenhancing one-carbon metabolism and by modulating the gut microbiome.

AB  - We tested swab specimens from pets in households in Ontario, Canada, with humanCOVID-19 cases by quantitative PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and surveyed pet owners forrisk factors associated with infection and seropositivity. We tested serumsamples for spike protein IgG and IgM in household pets and also in animals from shelters and low-cost neuter clinics. Among household pets, 2% (1/49) of swabspecimens from dogs and 7.7% (5/65) from cats were PCR positive, but 41% of dogserum samples and 52% of cat serum samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG orIgM. The likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in pet samples was higher forcats but not dogs that slept on owners' beds and for dogs and cats thatcontracted a new illness. Seropositivity in neuter-clinic samples was 16%(35/221); in shelter samples, 9.3% (7/75). Our findings indicate a highlikelihood for pets in households of humans with COVID-19 to seroconvert andbecome ill.

LID - 10.1111/jvim.16430 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypercalcemia is associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) incats, but studies assessing the physiologically relevant ionized calcium fractionare lacking. OBJECTIVES: To describe the prevalence and incidence rate of ionizedhypercalcemia, and to explore predictor variables to identify cats at risk ofionized hypercalcemia in a cohort of cats diagnosed with azotemic CKD. ANIMALS:One hundred sixty-four client-owned cats with azotemic CKD. METHODS: Variablesindependently associated with ionized hypercalcemia at diagnosis of azotemic CKD were explored by binary logistic regression. Cats that were normocalcemic atdiagnosis of azotemic CKD were followed over a 12-month period or until ionizedhypercalcemia occurred and baseline predictor variables for ionized hypercalcemiaexplored using Cox proportional hazards and receiver operating characteristiccurve analysis. RESULTS: Ionized hypercalcemia (median, 1.41 mmol/L; range,1.38-1.68) was observed in 33/164 (20%) cats at diagnosis of azotemic CKD and wasassociated with male sex, higher plasma total calcium and potassiumconcentrations, and lower plasma parathyroid hormone concentrations. Twenty-five of 96 initially normocalcemic (26%) cats followed for minimum 90 days developedionized hypercalcemia (median, 1.46 mmol/L; range, 1.38-1.80) at a median of 140 days after diagnosis of azotemic CKD (incidence rate, 0.48 per felinepatient-year). Only body condition score was independently associated withincident ionized hypercalcemia. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Theoccurrence of ionized hypercalcemia is high in cats with CKD. Continuedmonitoring of blood ionized calcium concentrations is advised.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Feline parvovirus (FPV) is a member of the family Parvoviridae, whichis a major enteric pathogen of cats worldwide. This study aimed to investigatethe prevalence of feline parvovirus in Beijing of China and analyze the geneticfeatures of detected viruses. RESULTS: In this study, a total of 60 (8.5%)parvovirus-positive samples were detected from 702 cat fecal samples usingparvovirus-specific PCR. The complete VP2 genes were amplified from all thesesamples. Among them, 55 (91.7%) sequences were characterized as FPV, and theother five (8.3%) were typed as canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) variants,comprised of four CPV-2c and a new CPV-2b strain. In order to investigate theorigin of CPV-2 variants in cats, we amplified full-length VP2 genes from sevenfecal samples of dogs infected with CPV-2, which were further classified asCPV-2c. The sequences of new CPV-2b/MT270586 and CPV-2c/MT270587 detected fromfeline samples shared 100% identity with previous canine isolates KT156833 andMF467242 respectively, suggesting the CPV-2 variants circulating in cats might bederived from dogs. Sequence analysis indicated new mutations, Ala91Ser andSer192Phe, in the FPV sequences, while obtained CPV-2c carried mutations reportedin Asian CPV variants, showing they share a common evolutionary pattern with the Asian 2c strains. Interestingly, the FPV sequence (MT270571), displaying fourCPV-specific residues, was found to be a putative recombinant sequence betweenCPV-2c and FPV. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP2 gene showed that amino acid and nucleotide mutations promoted the evolution of FPV and CPV lineages. CONCLUSIONS:Our findings will be helpful to further understand the circulation and evolution of feline and canine parvovirus in Beijing.

LID - 10.1071/RD22034 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Little is known about the hormonal regulation of feline ovariangranulosa cell proliferation and steroidogenesis. AIMS: To determine iftransforming growth factor beta1 (TGFB1), activin, epidermal growth factor (EGF),follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), melatonin, andinsulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) regulate granulosa cell steroidogenesis andproliferation in cats, three experiments were conducted in winter season.METHODS: Granulosa cells were isolated and treated in vitro with various hormonesin serum-free medium for 48h after an initial 48h plating in 10% fetal calfserum. KEY RESULTS: Treatment with IGF1 and FSH increased (P <0.05) estradiolproduction by 2.3- and 1.33-fold, respectively. In contrast, TGFB1 blocked (P<0.05) IGF1-induced estradiol production and inhibited FSH-induced estradiolproduction by 60%. Combined with FSH or FSH plus IGF1, TGFB1 inhibited (P <0.05) cell proliferation, whereas TGFB1 increased progesterone production by 2.8-foldin the presence of FSH plus IGF1. EGF decreased (P <0.05) FSH plus IGF1-inducedestradiol production by 89% but did not affect progesterone production or cellnumbers. Activin did not affect (P >0.10) cell numbers or steroidogenesis in the presence of FSH plus IGF1. Melatonin and LH decreased (P <0.05) estradiolproduction 53% and 59%, respectively, without affecting progesterone productionor cell proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: The present study has identified TGFB1 as amajor regulator of feline ovarian function, in addition to EGF, IGF1, melatonin, LH and FSH. IMPLICATIONS: These studies will provide useful information forfuture development of fertility control in feline species.

AB  - Dental pathology is among the most ubiquitous diseases in cats of all ages.Dental pain is yet to be fully understood in cats and therefore its presence isoften missed. To better understand feline dental disease as a pain trigger duringroutine examination and whether disease severity correlates to the degree ofpain, a 6-month prospective study in a cats' only veterinary hospital in Portugalwas conducted. Sixty-four cats that randomly presented for different clinicalprocedures were evaluated. Dental and periodontal abnormalities (primary dentalparameters, PDP), as well as clinical signs related to dental pain (secondarydental parameters, SDP), were assessed. All cats underwent an oral cavityexamination, upon which, the Feline Acute Pain Scale from Colorado StateUniversity Veterinary Teaching Hospital (CPS), was used in order to assess pain. Six PDP (periodontal disease, gingival index, calculus index, tooth resorption,tooth fracture and missing teeth) and five SDP (mouth discomfort, halitosis,hypersalivation, difficulty in holding food and several attempts at prehension offood), were compared with CPS pain scores. All SDP were significantly associated to higher CPS pain scores (p < 0.05). The number of missing teeth wassignificantly associated to higher CPS pain scores (p < 0.0001). A trend wasobserved between higher CPS pain scores and tooth resorption (p = 0.08). Thisstudy concluded that cats with dental disease feel pain during clinicalexamination and the pain increases as the severity of the disease progresses.

TI  - Emergence of personality in weaning-age kittens of the domestic cat?
PG  - e22281
LID - 10.1002/dev.22281 [doi]
AB  - Individual differences in behavior (animal personality) have recently receivedmuch attention although less so in young mammals. We tested 74 preweaning-agekittens from 16 litters of domestic cats in five everyday contexts repeated threetimes each across a 3-week period: a handling test where an experimenter held thekitten, a test where a piece of raw beef was given to the kitten and graduallywithdrawn, a test where the kitten was presented with a live mouse in a jar, atest where the kitten was briefly confined in a pet carrier, and an encounterwith an unfamiliar human who first remained passive and then attempted to stroke the kitten. We found consistent individual differences in behavior in all testsexcept with the mouse, although less marked than in equivalent tests with adultcats. Differences in behavior were unrelated to sex, body mass, litter size, ormaternal identity. We found only weak correlations in results among the tests(behavioral syndromes), again unlike findings in adult cats. We conclude thatweanling kittens show consistent individual differences in behavior but in adifferent manner to adults. If and how the pattern of such differences changesacross development remains to be studied.

PG  - 290-302
LID - 10.5455/OVJ.2022.v12.i2.18 [doi]
AB  - Background: Feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD) is a common disorderassociated with the dysfunction of the urinary bladder or urethra in tomcats.Aim: A prospective study was carried out on the point prevalence and odds ratio(OR) of the FLUTD in Shirazi and Baladi tomcats at Ismailia Governorate, Egypt,recording the prominent clinical manifestation and identifying the antibiogram,virulence, and antimicrobial resistance genes of the causative microorganisms.Methods: A total number of 420 tomcats admitted to the veterinary clinics ofIsmailia during the period June 2020 to May 2021 were examined for FLUTD. A totalof 1,260 urine samples were collected and analyzed. Results: Hematuria, dysuria, and pollakiuria were the most evident signs recorded in a total of 120 tomcatsdiagnosed with FLUTD. The diagnosed cases of FLUTD were associated with causeslike crystals (35.83%), pyogenic microorganisms (19.16%), and mixed cases(45.00%). The prevalence revealed highly significant (p < 0.01) increases in the cases caused by Escherichia coli, E. coli mixed cases, and calcium oxalate at >4 years; Staphylococcus aureus at </= 2 years; amorphous urate and phosphate at 2-4and >4 years in Shirazi and </=2 years in Baladi; triple phosphate at </=2 years in Shirazi and >4 years in Baladi; and S. aureus mixed cases at </=2 years. TheOR of FLUTD revealed higher odds of associations with E. coli, E. coli mixedcases, S. aureus, amorphous urate, and triple phosphate, as well as lower oddswith S. aureus, calcium oxalate, amorphous phosphate, and S. aureus mixed cases. Isolated E. coli revealed higher resistance to amoxicillin (AMX, 83.4%),ceftriaxone (83.4%), ceftazidime (CAZ, 75.0%), and cefoxitin (FOX, 50.0%), and S.aureus to oxacillin (100%), FOX (100%), AMX (85.8%), CAZ (76.2%), and FOX(50.0%). S. aureus-detected virulence genes were mecA, coa, spa, and tetK, and E.coli were fimH, iss, iutA, papC, blaTEM, blaCTX-M, and tetA. About 100% of E.coli and 76.1% of S. aureus isolates exhibited multidrug resistance. Conclusion: FLUTD in tomcats is associated with higher odds in E. coli, E. coli mixed cases, and triple phosphate at older ages (>4 years) with high antimicrobial resistance in the microbial isolates contributing to the disease.

TI  - Outcome of radioiodine therapy for feline hyperthyroidism: Fixed dose versusindividualized dose based on a clinical scoring system.
PG  - 231-241
LID - 10.5455/OVJ.2022.v12.i2.11 [doi]
AB  - Background: Hyperthyroidism is the most frequent endocrinopathy in older cats. Todate, there is no consensus on how to best calculate the dose of radioiodine toadminister to hyperthyroid cats. Aim: The goals of this study were to comparethyroid function, renal function, and survival time between hyperthyroid catsreceiving a fixed dose of radioiodine and those receiving an individualized dose calculated using a clinical scoring system. Methods: Medical records of 110 cats treated with radioiodine therapy at the University of Bern between 2010 and 2020 were reviewed. Thyroid function, renal function, and survival of cats treatedwith a fixed dose of radioiodine (2010-2015; n = 50) were compared to those ofcats treated with an individualized dose (2015-2020; n = 60) at different timepoints after therapy. Results: Treatment with a fixed dose of radioiodine (mean =168 +/- 26 MBq) was associated with 69% of euthyroidism, 19% persistenthyperthyroidism, and 12% hypothyroidism, whereas treatment with an individualizeddose (mean = 120 +/- 30 MBq) led to 54% euthyroidism, 23% hyperthyroidism, and23% hypothyroidism (p = 0.73). More than 12 months after treatment, the incidenceof azotemia was comparable between cats treated with a fixed dose (37%) and thosetreated with an individualized dose (31%) (p = 0.77). No factors were found to bepredictive of treatment failure (hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism) aftertherapy. Median survival time after radioiodine therapy was 44 months. In amultivariate analysis, persistent hyperthyroidism was the only variableindependently associated with a shorter survival time (HR = 6.24, p = 0.002).Conclusion: The method of calculating the dose of radioiodine (fixed vs.individualized) to treat feline hyperthyroidism does not appear to be decisivefor posttreatment thyroid function, renal function, or survival.

PG  - 192-196
LID - 10.5455/OVJ.2022.v12.i2.6 [doi]
AB  - Background: Benign esophageal strictures arise from various etiologies, mostlysevere esophagitis. Although endoscopic balloon dilation is still the first-line therapy, refractory or recurrent strictures do occur and remain a challenge tothe endoluminal treatment. The aim of this report was to communicate a recurrent esophageal stricture resolution in a cat treated with balloon dilatation andsteroid injections in Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Argentina. Case Description: A1-year-old spayed mix-breed female cat was consulted to the Veterinary Endoscopy Service for recurring regurgitation after two previous esophageal dilations. The cat had received doxycycline for Mycoplasma spp. infection and 20 days after the treatment consulted for dysphagia and regurgitation. Upper esophagogastroscopy(UGE) was performed with an Olympus CV-160 8.7 mm diameter endoscope; an annular 7 mm stricture was observed 3 cm caudal to the cranial esophagus sphincter. Threeballoon dilatations procedures were performed with a Boston Scientific ControlledRadial Expansion (CRE) balloon 8-10-12 mm of 1 minute each. Because of ongoingclinical signs, another UGE was performed 15 days from the first procedure: a 3mm stricture was encountered, balloon dilatation was repeated with 6-10-12 mmdiameter, and a four-quadrant triamcinolone was injected in the submucosa.Clinically, the cat could eat with no alterations until day 20, where it started with mild dysphagia. Another UGE was performed, and the known stricture conserveda 11 mm diameter and balloon dilatation 12-15-16.5 mm with triamcinoloneinjection was repeated 30 days after the previous procedure. The cat could eatkibbles with no clinical signs in an 11-month follow-up. Conclusion: Thealternative to triamcinolone injection after balloon dilatation presented in thisclinical report was successful and it could be a therapeutic option for recurrentesophageal strictures in cats as it is in human medicine.

TI  - Unexpected clinical case of Pasteurella multocida infectious endocarditis in apatient with iv drug abuse: why epidemiological history matters.
PG  - 130-136
LID - 10.18683/germs.2022.1316 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Right-sided lesions caused by staphylococci are the most commonclinical entity of infectious endocarditis (IE) among iv drug abusers. But someaspects of the epidemiological history are critical in terms of early detectionof uncommon pathogens. Case report: We describe a clinical observation of native aortic valve IE caused by Pasteurella multocida in a 37-year-old female with ahistory of heroin addiction, alcohol abuse and liver cirrhosis.She presentedherself at our hospital with acute fever, chills, subconjunctival petechialhemorrhages, traces of scratches on the hands, splenomegaly, peripheral edema,elevated WBC and inflammatory serum markers. Initial transthoracicechocardiography was negative, but the patient was put on oxacillin for suspectedright-sided IE. The transesophageal echocardiography revealed vegetation onnoncoronary leaflet of aortic valve. Blood culture was positive with the growthof P. multocida in 4/4 samples.On detailed questioning, a close domestic contact with cats was revealed. Oxacillin was switched to meropenem and tigecycline with a prompt clinical response. The P. multocida isolate was found to be susceptible to penicillins, so the patient was discharged after 3 weeks with recommendations to take amoxicillin for up to 4 weeks. At 3 and 6 months follow-up there were no signs of IE relapse revealed. Conclusions: P. multocida is a rare causative agentof IE. In our case, this pathogen was identified in a patient with injection druguse, where such etiology is not usually assumed. The close contact with cats was not taken into account, which caused late diagnosis and delayed therapy.

AB  - Introduction: Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a commensal bacterium found in thesaliva of dogs and cats. In most cases C. canimorsus causes local infectionresulting from bite-wounds, scratches or licks but severe forms can occur. Thefollowing case describes a severe and rapidly fatal sepsis and disseminatedintravascular coagulation with no evidence of bite in a patient without obviouscause of immunosuppression, diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction and 16S rRNAgene sequencing. Case report: Herein we present a rare case of a 39-year-old man who was taken care of by the emergency medical service for faintness, fever andchills associated with generalized mottling. Despite critical care management andbroad-spectrum antibiotherapy, the patient presented an irrepressible shock with disseminated intravascular coagulation and multiple organ failure. He died duringthe night. The initial etiological assessment was negative but rod-shapedinclusions could be observed in his blood. A pan-bacterial polymerase chainreaction targeting part of the gene encoding 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid(rRNA) was carried out directly on blood cultures; the sequencing identifiedCapnocytophaga canimorsus. Conclusions: This observation illustrates thepotential severity of C. canimorsus infection even in a patient without neitherobvious causes of immunosuppression nor evidence of bite. The presence ofintracellular bacillary forms on the blood smear is an important informationwhich should lead to performing a polymerase chain reaction and 16S rRNA genesequencing.

TI  - Cardiovascular and Gas Exchange Effects of Individualized Positive End-ExpiratoryPressures in Cats Anesthetized With Isoflurane.
PG  - 865673
LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.865673 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: To compare the effects of four levels of end-expiratory pressure[zero (ZEEP) and three levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)] on the cardiovascular system and gas exchange of cats anesthetized with isoflurane andmechanically ventilated for 3 h with a tidal volume of 10 ml/kg. Study Design:Prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Animals: Six healthy male neuteredpurpose-bred cats. Methods: Anesthesia was induced with isoflurane and maintainedat 1.3 minimum alveolar concentration. PEEP of maximal respiratory compliance(PEEPmaxCrs) was identified in a decremental PEEP titration, and cats wererandomly ventilated for 3 h with one of the following end-expiratory pressures:ZEEP, PEEPmaxCrs minus 2 cmH2O (PEEPmaxCrs-2), PEEPmaxCrs, and PEEPmaxCrs plus 2 cmH2O (PEEPmaxCrs+2). Cardiovascular and gas exchange variables were recorded at 5, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min (T5 to T180, respectively) of ventilation andcompared between and within ventilation treatments with mixed-model ANOVAfollowed by Dunnet's and Tukey's tests (normal distribution) or Friedman testfollowed by the Dunn's test (non-normal distribution). Significance to reject thenull hypothesis was considered p < 0.05. Results: Mean arterial pressure(MAP-mmHg) was lower in PEEPmaxCrs+2 [63 (49-69); median (range)] when comparedto ZEEP [71 (67-113)] at T5 and stroke index (ml/beat/kg) was lower inPEEPmaxCrs+2 (0.70 +/- 0.20; mean +/- SD) than in ZEEP (0.90 +/- 0.20) at T60.Cardiac index, oxygen delivery index (DO2I), systemic vascular resistance index, and shunt fraction were not significantly different between treatments. The ratiobetween arterial partial pressure and inspired concentration of oxygen(PaO2/FIO2) was lower in ZEEP than in the PEEP treatments at various time points.At T180, DO2I was higher when compared to T5 in PEEPmaxCrs. Dopamine was requiredto maintain MAP higher than 60 mmHg in one cat during PEEPmaxCrs and in threecats during PEEPmaxCrs+2. Conclusion: In cats anesthetized with isoflurane andmechanically ventilated for 3 h, all levels of PEEP mildly improved gas exchange with no significant difference in DO2I when compared to ZEEP. The PEEP levelshigher than PEEPmaxCrs-2 caused more cardiovascular depression, and dopamine was an effective treatment. A temporal increase in DO2I was observed in the catsventilated with PEEPmaxCrs. The effects of these levels of PEEP on respiratorymechanics, ventilation-induced lung injury, as well as in obese and criticallyill cats deserve future investigation for a better understanding of the clinical use of PEEP in this species.

TI  - DNA metabarcoding reveals a broad dietary range for Tasmanian devils introducedto a naive ecosystem.
PG  - e8936
LID - 10.1002/ece3.8936 [doi]
AB  - Top carnivores are essential for maintaining ecosystem stability andbiodiversity. Yet, carnivores are declining globally and current in situ threatmitigations cannot halt population declines. As such, translocations ofcarnivores to historic sites or those outside the species' native range arebecoming increasingly common. As carnivores are likely to impact herbivore andsmall predator populations, understanding how carnivores interact within anecosystem following translocation is necessary to inform potential remedialmanagement and future translocations. Dietary analyses provide a preliminaryassessment of the direct influence of translocated carnivores on a recipientecosystem. We used a metabarcoding approach to quantify the diet of Tasmaniandevils introduced to Maria Island, Tasmania, a site outside the species' nativerange. We extracted DNA from 96 scats and used a universal primer set targetingthe vertebrate 12S rRNA gene to identify diet items. Tasmanian devils on MariaIsland had an eclectic diet, with 63 consumed taxa identified. Cat DNA wasdetected in 14% of scats, providing the first instance of cats appearing as part of Tasmanian devil diets either via predation or scavenging. Short-tailshearwaters and little penguins were commonly consumed, corresponding withprevious surveys showing sharp population declines in these species since theintroduction of Tasmanian devils. Our results indicate that the introduction ofcarnivores to novel ecosystems can be very successful for the focal species, but that commonly consumed species should be closely monitored to identify anyvulnerable species in need of remedial management.

TI  - Ego network analysis of the trophic structure of an island land bird through 300 years of climate change and invaders.
PG  - e8916
LID - 10.1002/ece3.8916 [doi]
AB  - Ego net analysis is a well-known practice in social sciences, where an ego net(EN) consists of a focal node, the ego, and its links to other nodes, calledalters, and alter-alter links may also be included. An EN describes how a focalnode is embedded in its interaction context. Here, I introduce EN analysis toecology in a study of the trophic network of a sub-Antarctic land bird, LesserSheathbill (Chionis minor). Data originate from the sheathbill population onMarion Island in the Southern Ocean. The bird is ego and its enemies and food arealters. The EN is organized along three dimensions: habitat, interaction type,and time (from before human arrival in 1803 and until a future year 2100). Ten ENdescriptors are defined, estimated, and used to track the 300 years of change in sheathbill EN structure. Since 1803, the EN has passed two major, but reversible shifts-seal exploitation in the 19th century and presence of cats from 1949 to1991. These shifts can be read as structural changes in the sheathbill EN. In thefuture, a third, perhaps irreversible change is predicted, driven by climatechange and a surprising, recent shift to seabird predation by House Mouse, themost detrimental of all extant invaders on Marion. In a warmer and drier future, the mouse will proliferate, and if this forces seabirds to abandon the island,their accumulation of detritus runs dry, starving a rich invertebrate detritivorefauna, which also is a key food source to sheathbills. These detritivorestogether with plants have also constituted the main food sources of mice. The EN descriptors quantify that story. In the future, these events may lead to acollapse of the island ecosystem, including extinction of the sheathbill-unlessplans for mouse eradication are implemented.

AB  - This study aimed to assess 1) the effect of high environmental temperatures onsperm production and 2) the effectiveness of a temperature-humidity index (THI)to predict the degree of thermal stress in a cat model. Semen collection wasperformed by electroejaculation for 18 mo in 20 tomcats maintained undercontrolled photoperiod. Still, temperature and humidity were not experimentallymanipulated to describe the effect of natural climate conditions on seminalsamples. Ejaculates (n = 512) were then grouped according to temperature records of the sampling day and compared by temperature and THI index. Significant lower sperm parameters and increase sperm tail abnormalities were observed during warm environments (temperature and THI). Concentration and total sperm count were the most affected parameters. Environmental temperatures of 28.5 degrees C with 54%relative humidity (THI = 77.07) and 27.9 degrees C with 66% humidity (THI =77.84) were upper thresholds of moderate thermal stress. Moreover, days withrelative humidity near 90% led to severe thermal stress with temperatures as low as 26.6 degrees C (THI = 78.88). The current study demonstrates the detrimentaleffect of high environmental temperatures on sperm quality in the domestic cat.This effect is observed at lower temperatures when high relative humidity ispresent. In this sense, the THI was a reliable predictor of the magnitude ofthermal stress experienced by cats. Thus, cats from reproductive programs should be maintained under controlled photoperiod cycles with temperatures around 20degrees C and humidity around 70% to avoid semen detrimental effects.

TI  - Prevalence and characteristics of ocular diseases in Sphynx cats: A retrospectiveassessment (2012-2021) and comparison with non-Sphynx cats.
LID - 10.1111/vop.12994 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the prevalence of ocular diseases in Sphynx cats, andcompare disease characteristics with other feline breeds. METHODS: Medicalrecords of Sphynx cats presented to an ophthalmology referral center between1/2012 and 4/2021 were examined. Cats of other breeds examined during the sameperiod served as controls. RESULTS: One hundred ten Sphynx cats were examinedduring the study period, diagnosed with corneal sequestrum (n = 42 cats), lowereyelid entropion (n = 25), presumed herpetic keratoconjunctivitis (n = 19),conjunctivitis (n = 7), corneal ulcers (n = 6), nasolacrimal ductatresia/obstruction (n = 6), corneal dystrophy (n = 3), eosinophilic keratitis (n= 2), uveitis (n = 2), non-ulcerative keratitis (n = 1), and cataract (n = 1).Corneal sequestrum was significantly more common in Sphynx versus non-Sphynx cats(odds ratio = 8.0, 95% CI = 5.3-12.2, p < .001), and age of diagnosis wassignificantly younger in Sphynx cats (2.0 +/- 1.5 years vs. 5.9 +/- 4.0 years, p < .001). Corneal sequestrum recurrence was noted in 19.4% Sphynx eyes and 6.4%non-Sphynx eyes undergoing surgery (p = .015). Lower eyelid entropion-most often bilateral (80%)-was significantly more common in Sphynx versus non-Sphynx cats(odds ratio = 4.1, 95% CI = 2.3-7.1, p < .001), and age of diagnosis wassignificantly younger in Sphynx cats (0.9 +/- 1.4 years vs. 3.5 +/- 3.3 years, p < .005). CONCLUSIONS: Corneal sequestrum and entropion were overrepresented anddiagnosed at an earlier age in Sphynx cats when compared with the general feline population. Given the high prevalence, early age of onset, and relatively highrecurrence of corneal sequestrum in Sphynx cats, further studies are warranted tobetter understand etiopathogenesis and preferred therapies.

TI  - Molecular epidemiological study on ticks and tick-borne protozoan parasites(Apicomplexa: Cytauxzoon and Hepatozoon spp.) from wild cats (Felis silvestris), Mustelidae and red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) in central Europe, Hungary.
PG  - 174
LID - 10.1186/s13071-022-05271-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Among live wild mammals adapted to urban and peri-urban habitats inEurope, members of the families Felidae, Mustelidae and Sciuridae deserve specialattention as pathogen reservoirs because all of these families include membersthat are kept as pets. We report here the results of our study on two importantgroups of tick-borne protozoan parasites in ticks and tissues of wild cats,mustelids and red squirrels. METHODS: DNA was extracted from the tissues ofcarnivores (wild cats, mustelids; n = 16) and red squirrels (n = 4), as well asfrom ixodid ticks (n = 89) collected from these hosts. These DNA extracts werescreened for piroplasms and Hepatozoon spp. using conventional PCR analysis andsequencing. In addition, 53 pooled samples of 259 questing Haemaphysalis concinnaticks were evaluated for the presence of Hepatozoon DNA, followed by phylogeneticanalyses. RESULTS: One wild cat was found to be coinfected with Cytauxzooneuropaeus and a new genotype of Hepatozoon felis, and two additional wild catswere infected with H. felis from a different phylogenetic group. In mustelids,Hepatozoon martis and two further Hepatozoon genotypes were detected. The latter clustered separately, close to others reported from eastern Asia. In addition,Hepatozoon sciuri was detected in red squirrels. Morphologic and molecularanalyses verified eight tick species. One wild cat was infected with a H. felisgenotype that was significantly different from that in Ixodes ricinus femalesinfesting this cat. Only three pools of questing H. concinna nymphs testedpositive for Hepatozoon, one of which contained H. martis. CONCLUSIONS: Thisstudy provides the first evidence of the occurrence of any Cytauxzoon species andof three Hepatozoon species in Hungary. In addition to H. martis, two furthermustelid-associated Hepatozoon genotypes were detected, one of which was new interms of phylogenetic and broader geographical contexts. This may be the firstindication that H. felis genotypes from both of its phylogenetic groups occur in Europe. This also appears to be the first evidence of H. felis and C. europaeuscoinfection in felids in Europe, and of autochthonous H. felis infection in wild cats north of the Mediterranean Basin. New tick-host associations were alsoobserved in this study. Based on the results, H. felis and H. martis mightsurvive transstadially in I. ricinus and H. concinna, respectively.

TI  - Accuracy of the IDEXX SediVue Dx analyzer for quantifying RBC and WBC indices in the urine sediments of cats and dogs compared with manual microscopicevaluations.
LID - 10.1111/vcp.13141 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The IDEXX SediVue Dx (SediVue) is an automated, in-clinic urinesediment analyzer for veterinary patients. The bias between the results frommanual microscopy and the SediVue is currently unknown. OBJECTIVES: To assess thediagnostic accuracy of the SediVue, we aimed to determine the bias between theSediVue (index test) and manual microscopy (reference standard) for thequantification of RBCs and WBCs in urine. METHODS: Urine remnant samples werecollected from cats and dogs that contained RBCs (n = 462) and WBCs (n = 510).Retrospective analysis of results from urine sediment examinations using bothmanual microscopy (using a KOVA and DeciSlide system) and the SediVue (1.0.1.3)was performed. Bias was determined with Bland-Altman plots. SediVue-capturedimages from high-bias samples were reviewed, and biases were compared. RESULTS:The median bias for semi-quantitative RBC and WBC counts was determined for RBCand WBC counts. The cutoffs were RBC </= 5/HPF, 0.3; RBC 5.1-10/HPF, 10.1; RBC10.1-20/HPF, 10.6; and RBC > 20/HPF, 28.93; WBC </= 5/HPF, 0.1; WBC 5.1-10/HPF,2.2; WBC 10.1-20/HPF, 9.4; and WBC > 20/HPF, 26.6. High bias between the methods was identified in 98 samples (21.0%) with RBCs and 77 samples (15.7%) with WBCs. Reviewer-based enumeration of the SediVue-captured images decreased thepercentage of samples with high bias to 17.3% for RBCs and to 11.4% for WBCs.CONCLUSIONS: Bias in the RBC and WBC counts between manual microscopy and theSediVue was unlikely to impact clinical interpretations in a majority of cases.Although reviewer enumeration of SediVue-captured images reduced observed bias,inherent differences between methodologies appeared to have a larger impact onthe bias.

TI  - Resting state functional brain networks associated with emotion processing infrontotemporal lobar degeneration.
LID - 10.1038/s41380-022-01612-9 [doi]
AB  - This study investigated the relationship between emotion processing andresting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) of the brain networks infrontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Eighty FTLD patients (including caseswith behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia, primary progressive aphasia, progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome, motor neuron disease) and 65 healthycontrols underwent rs-functional MRI. Emotion processing was tested using theComprehensive Affect Testing System (CATS). In patients and controls,correlations were investigated between each emotion construct and rs-FC changeswithin critical networks. Mean rs-FC of the clusters significantly associatedwith CATS scoring were compared among FTLD groups. FTLD patients had pathologicalCATS scores compared with controls. In controls, increased rs-FC of thecerebellar and visuo-associative networks correlated with better scores inemotion-matching and discrimination tasks, respectively; while decreased rs-FC ofthe visuo-spatial network was related with better performance in theaffect-matching and naming. In FTLD, the associations between rs-FC and CATSscores involved more brain regions, such as orbitofrontal and middle frontal gyriwithin anterior networks (i.e., salience and default-mode), parietal andsomatosensory regions within visuo-spatial and sensorimotor networks, caudate andthalamus within basal-ganglia network. Rs-FC changes associated with CATS weresimilar among all FTLD groups. In FTLD compared to controls, the pattern of rs-FCassociated with emotional processing involves a larger number of brain regions,likely due to functional specificity loss and compensatory attempts. Theseassociations were similar across all FTLD groups, suggesting a commonphysiopathological mechanism of emotion processing breakdown, regardless theclinical presentation and pattern of atrophy.

TI  - Diode laser-assisted transcanal endoscopic removal of an aural polyp in theexternal auditory canal of a dog.
LID - 10.1002/vms3.845 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In humans, aural polyps comprise fibrovascular tissue covered by the respiratory epithelium. Aural polyps with ciliated epithelium are common in cats but are rarely reported in dogs. In a previous case, a mass filled the tympaniccavity alone, and it was surgically removed. OBJECTIVES: To report a case of acanine aural polyp with ciliated epithelium extending from the dorsal tympaniccavity to the external auditory canal with detailed otological features and todemonstrate the usefulness of the transcanal endoscopic procedure (TEP) with adiode laser as a less-invasive therapy. METHODS: A 12-year-old castrated maleCavalier King Charles Spaniel presented with a 6-month history of unilateralchronic otorrhoea. Video-otoscope examination revealed a protruding, reddish and soft-to-rubbery round mass in the right horizontal ear canal. Computed tomographyand magnetic resonance imaging further revealed a smooth mass extending from the dorsal portion of the tympanic cavity into the horizontal part of the externalauditory canal. However, it showed no lesions in the dorsal tympanic cavity.RESULTS: The mass was removed using aural forceps by a traction-torsionmanoeuvre. The suspected base of the mass on the caudal side of the uppertympanic cavity was confirmed by a rigid scope, and it was completely vaporisedwith a diode laser. Histopathology revealed foci of columnar ciliated epithelium embedded in the connective tissue encapsulated by stratified squamous epithelium.No recurrence was observed at 3 years and 8 months. CONCLUSION: We describe arare case of an aural polyp with ciliated epithelium extending from theupper-middle ear to the external auditory canal in a dog. The TEP using a diodelaser may be a useful minimally invasive treatment option for managing externalauditory canal polyps.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence of ocular lesions in cats with newlydiagnosed histoplasmosis. ANIMALS: 55 client-owned domestic cats. PROCEDURES: As part of this prospective case series, cats diagnosed with histoplasmosis between the years 2015 and 2020 underwent complete ophthalmic examinations by aboard-certified veterinary ophthalmologist prior to the initiation of antifungal treatment. Histoplasmosis was diagnosed by consistent clinical findings andidentification of Histoplasma yeast on pathology or by the use of a commercially available enzyme immunoassay to detect Histoplasma antigen in urine. RESULTS: Of the 55 cats, 45 (82%; 95% CI, 72% to 92%) had signs of active anterior,posterior, or panuveitis. The most common lesions were identified in theposterior portion of the globe and included chorioretinitis and partial retinaldetachments (44/55 [80%; 95% CI, 69% to 90%] cats). CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Detailed ophthalmic examinations should be performed on all cats with diagnosed orsuspected histoplasmosis, as ocular involvement and subsequent vision loss arecommon.

AB  - A vast global literature documents that free-roaming domestic cats (Felis catus) have substantial negative effects on wildlife, including through predation, fear,disease and competition-related impacts that have contributed to numerouswildlife extinctions and population declines worldwide. However, no study hassynthesized this literature on cat impacts on wildlife to evaluate itsoverarching biases and major gaps. To direct future research and conservationrelated to cat impacts on wildlife, we conducted a global literature review that entailed evaluation and synthesis of patterns and gaps in the literature related to the geographic context, methods and types of impacts studied. Our systematicliterature search compiled 2245 publications. We extracted information from 332of these meeting inclusion criteria designed to ensure the relevance of studiesanalysed. This synthesis of research on cat impacts on wildlife highlights afocus on oceanic islands, Australia, Europe, and North America, and on ruralareas, predation, impacts of unowned cats, and impacts at population and species levels. Key research advances needed to better understand and manage cat impacts include more studies in underrepresented, highly biodiverse regions (Africa,Asia, and South America), on cat impacts other than predation, and on methodsdesigned to reduce impacts on wildlife. The identified areas of needed researchinto cat impacts on wildlife will be critical to further clarifying the role ofcats in global wildlife declines and to implementing science-driven policy andmanagement that benefit conservation efforts.

AB  - In June-September 2021, we investigated severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in domestic dogs and cats (n = 225) inBangkok and the vicinities, Thailand. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in a dog and a cat from COVID-19 positive households. Whole genome sequence analysis identifiedSARS-CoV-2 delta variant of concern (B.1.617.2). Phylogenetic analysis showedthat SARS-CoV-2 isolated from dog and cat were grouped into sublineage AY.30 and AY.85, respectively. Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in both dog (day 9) and cat (day 14) after viral RNA detection. This study raises awarenesson spill-over of variant of concern in domestic animals due to human-animalinterface. Thus, surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in domestic pets should be routinely conducted.

AB  - Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection as a zoonotic disease virus has been thoroughlyinvestigated in pigs around the world, but there have been few studies in petanimals. Although molecular and serological evidence suggests that numerous otheranimal species may act as HEV hosts in industrialized countries, domestic pigsand wild boars are the main reservoirs of HEV genotypes 3 and 4 for humaninfections. In this study, the sera of 91 household cats from Turkiye werestudied by using serological (new generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays(ELISA)) and molecular methods. HEV antibodies were determined with an overallprevalence of 5.4%. The seropositive distributions were (3.2%) in the 0-2 agegroup, 1 (1.09%) in the 2-8 age group, and 1 (1.09%) in the cats older than 8years, despite the fact that there was no statistically significant differenceacross age and sex groups (p > 0.05). Viral RNA was not detected in the sera ofthe household cats using hemi-nested and nested RT-PCR. These findings show that cats in Turkiye have a low seroprevalence of HEV. Nevertheless, it is importantin terms of detecting the presence of HEV antibodies in cats for the first timein Turkiye. More research is required to determine the effects of virusesbelonging to the Hepeviridae family on cats, as well as their transmission tohumans.

LID - 10.1177/03009858221098431 [doi]
AB  - Ocular mycobacterial infections are an under-recognized cause of morbidity in thedomestic cat. This study aimed to explore the distribution, histopathologicalappearance, and severity of feline ocular mycobacterial lesions, and tocharacterize the immune cell population with immunohistochemistry. Routinehistological staining with hematoxylin and eosin, and Masson's trichrome, wasperformed to identify ocular lesions and assign an inflammation score based onthe number of cells present. Acid-fast bacilli were detected with Ziehl-Neelsen, and immunohistochemistry for ionized calcium-binding adaptor protein-1 (Iba1),calprotectin, cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3), and Pax5 was undertaken onformalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 24 cases of ocularmycobacteriosis. Posterior or panuveitis with concurrent retinitis was identifiedin 20/24 cases (83%), with retinal detachment in 16/20 (80%) of these cases.Choroidal lesions had the highest median inflammation score.Ziehl-Neelsen-positive organisms were detected in 20/24 cases (83%), with thehighest prevalence of acid-fast bacilli detected in choroidal lesions (16/20,80%). Lesions were typically granulomatous to pyogranulomatous, characterized by abundant numbers of Iba1-positive macrophages, followed by calprotectin-positive granulocytes and monocytes, fewer T cells, and rarer B cells. However, whereiritis was identified, inflammation was typically lymphoplasmacytic (11/16 cases,69%). Where diagnostic testing was performed, tuberculosis (ie, infection withMycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium microti, or a nonspeciated Mycobacteriumtuberculosis-complex pathogen) was diagnosed in 20/22 cats (91%), withMycobacterium lepraemurium infection identified in the other 2/22 cats (9%).These results suggest the choroid is the primary site of lesion development inmost cases of feline ocular mycobacteriosis, and inflammatory changes areassociated with the presence of mycobacteria localized to ocular tissues.

AB  - Escherichia coli (E. coli) was identified among the most relevantantimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria in the EU for dogs and cats, horses,swine, poultry, cattle, sheep and goats in previous scientific opinions. Thus, ithas been assessed according to the criteria of the Animal Health Law (AHL), inparticular criteria of Article 7 on disease profile and impacts, Article 5 on itseligibility to be listed, Annex IV for its categorisation according to diseaseprevention and control rules as in Article 9 and Article 8 for listing animalspecies related to the bacterium. The assessment has been performed following amethodology previously published. The outcome is the median of the probabilityranges provided by the experts, which indicates whether each criterion isfulfilled (lower bound >/= 66%) or not (upper bound </= 33%), or whether there isuncertainty about fulfilment. Reasoning points are reported for criteria withuncertain outcome. According to the assessment here performed, it is uncertainwhether AMR E. coli can be considered eligible to be listed for Unionintervention according to Article 5 of the AHL (33-66% probability). According tothe criteria in Annex IV, for the purpose of categorisation related to the level of prevention and control as in Article 9 of the AHL, the AHAW Panel concludedthat the bacterium does not meet the criteria in Sections 1, 2, 3 and 4(Categories A, B, C and D; 0-5%, 5-10%, 10-33% and 10-33% probability of meeting the criteria, respectively) and the AHAW Panel was uncertain whether it meets thecriteria in Section 5 (Category E, 33-66% probability of meeting the criteria).The animal species to be listed for AMR E. coli according to Article 8 criteriainclude mammals, birds, reptiles and fish.

TI  - Purification-induced damage to calicivirus particles at near-atomic resolution.
LID - 10.1099/jgv.0.001742 [doi]
AB  - The purification of virus particles is an essential process for the manufactureof vaccines. However, the application of different purification processes mayaffect the quality of the virus particles, such as structural integrity andhomogeneity, which may further influence the infectivity and immunogenicity ofthe purified virus. In this study, we took Feline calicivirus (FCV), a commonnatural pathogen in cats belonging to Caliciviridae, as a research model. Byusing cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we incorporated the 3D classificationprocess as a virus flexibility evaluation system. Cryo-EM images of virusparticles resulting from different purification processes were compared atnear-atomic resolution. The results indicated that molecular sieving purificationwill impact the stability of P-domains through increasing flexibility asdetermined by the evaluation system, which can be extended to assess thepurification effect on the entire particle. This evaluation process can befurther applied to all non-enveloped viruses.

AB  - Echocardiography is an invaluable technique for the diagnosis of heart disease.The aim of this study was to develop 3-D models of healthy and diseased hearts ofdogs and cats, and to evaluate their effectiveness in assisting veterinaryundergraduates to understand echocardiographic imaging planes. Resin modelsdepicting the main echocardiographic imaging planes of normal hearts werecreated, as well as example hearts with features of mitral degeneration in dogsand hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in cats. After a theoretical class, fourth-yearstudents were randomly assigned to one of two groups (model group or controlgroup). The model group had access to the 3-D models, along with self-explanatorytext about echocardiographic imaging planes; the control group only had access tothe self-explanatory text. Both groups were allowed 2 weeks to study theirallocated resources, after which the students undertook an assessment to evaluatetheir learning and completed a questionnaire about their experiences andsatisfaction with the respective teaching method. A total of 39 studentsparticipated in the study, 19 in the model group and 20 in the control group.Students assigned to the model group spent more time studying (p = 0.0027). Theproportion of students who achieved a satisfactory grade in the assessment was89.5% in the model group and 60% in the control group (p = 0.0449). The 3-Dmodels facilitated, and significantly improved, the identification of cardiacstructures and disease-associated abnormalities, and the learning process ingeneral. Additionally, the models seemed to provide greater student motivationfor studying echocardiography.

TI  - Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection in domestic pet cats in Australiaand New Zealand: Guidelines for diagnosis, prevention and management.
LID - 10.1111/avj.13166 [doi]
AB  - Despite the passage of over 30 years since its discovery, the importance offeline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) on the health and longevity of infecteddomestic cats is hotly debated amongst feline experts. Notwithstanding theabsence of good quality information, Australian and New Zealand (NZ)veterinarians should aim to minimise the exposure of cats to FIV. The mostreliable way to achieve this goal is to recommend that all pet cats are keptexclusively indoors, or with secure outdoor access (e.g., cat enclosures, secure gardens), with FIV testing of any in-contact cats. All animal holding facilities should aim to individually house adult cats to limit the spread of FIV infection in groups of animals that are stressed and do not have established socialhierarchies. Point-of-care (PoC) FIV antibody tests are available in Australiaand NZ that can distinguish FIV-infected and uninfected FIV-vaccinated cats(Witness and Anigen Rapid). Although testing of whole blood, serum or plasmaremains the gold standard for FIV diagnosis, PoC testing using saliva may offer awelfare-friendly alternative in the future. PCR testing to detect FIV infectionis not recommended as a screening procedure since a negative PCR result does not rule out FIV infection and is only recommended in specific scenarios. Australiaand NZ are two of three countries where a dual subtype FIV vaccine (Fel-O-Vax(R) FIV) is available and offers a further avenue for disease prevention. Since FIVvaccination only has a reported field effectiveness of 56% in Australia, andpossibly lower in NZ, FIV-vaccinated cats should undergo annual FIV testing priorto annual FIV re-vaccination using a suitable PoC kit to check infection has not occurred in the preceding year. With FIV-infected cats, clinicians should strive to be even more thorough than usual at detecting early signs of disease. The mosteffective way to enhance the quality of life and life expectancy of FIV-infected cats is to optimise basic husbandry and to treat any concurrent conditions early in the disease course. Currently, no available drugs are registered for thetreatment of FIV infection. Critically, the euthanasia of healthy FIV-infectedcats, and sick FIV-infected cats without appropriate clinical investigations,should not occur.

AB  - New discoveries relating to phosphorus homeostasis include the hormonesfibroblast growth factor-23 and klotho produced by bone and kidney. Thesehormones, together with novel understanding of how calcium and phosphate ions arecarried in colloidal form as calciprotein particles, have changed our view of howphosphorus is regulated. Recognition that high dietary intake of inorganic forms of phosphorus in humans is a risk factor for both cardiovascular and renaldiseases have led to re-examination of the impact of inorganic sources ofphosphorus in prepared cat foods on renal health. Data suggest that whenhomeostatic mechanisms lead to proximal tubular (S3 segment) phosphateconcentrations exceeding 3.25 mmol/L for a significant part of the day, tubularstress and structural kidney damage ensues. Recent experimental rodent studiessupport the concept that calciprotein particles form in the proximal tubule atthese prevailing phosphate concentrations and trigger proximal tubular damage.Long-term feeding studies in cats suggest that carefully formulated prepareddiets containing 1 g/Mcal of inorganic phosphorus (in the form of sodiumtripolyphosphate or potassium monophosphate and pyrophosphate), resulting inestimated tubular phosphate concentrations < 2.5 mmol/L can be fed to healthyadult cats without detectable adverse effects on renal health.

AB  - Oncostatin M receptor beta (OSMRbeta) mediates signaling of Oncostatin M (OSM)and interleukine-31 (IL-31), two key cytokines involved in many importantbiological processes including inflammation and cancer progression. Moreimportantly, OSMRbeta might be a potential biomarker and therapeutic target forsome diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, pruritus and ovarian cancer.In this study, soluble recombinant canine OSMRbeta (cOSMRbeta) was experimentallyexpressed as a native antigen to develop an effective cOSMRbeta-specificmonoclonal antibody (mAb), 2O2, using hybridoma technology. It was demonstratedthat 2O2 is able to detect OSMRbeta expressed on cell surface usingimmunofluorescence assay (IFA) and flow cytometry (FACS). This mAb exhibits very high binding affinity to cOSMRbeta with the KD and half-maximal effectiveconcentration (EC50) values of 2.49 nM and 96.96 ng/ml, respectively. Meanwhile, it didn't show any cross-relativities with feline OSMRbeta (fOSMRbeta) and human OSMRbeta (hOSMRbeta). Moreover, we determined the binding epitope of 2O2, whichlocalizes in the domain VI (DVI, amino acids 623-734) of cOSMRbeta. Inconclusion, this novel mAb, 2O2, can be used in immunoassays, including IFA, FACSand enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to facilitate studies in dogs.

AB  - Adrenal computed tomography characteristics (aCTc) in healthy cats are known, butreference intervals for diseased cats are lacking. aCTc of cats without evidence of adrenal disease (NAD group) were compared to parameters of cats with possible concurrent adrenal disease (PAD group). The PAD group was assessed for adrenalmasses or other morphological deviations using the NAD group as reference.Associations of aCTc with patient variables were explored, and all results werecompared with published aCTc of healthy cats. No incidental adrenal masses wereidentified in the PAD group (n = 92), and only few aCTc differed compared to the NAD group (n = 30). The NAD group showed similar associations of patientvariables and aCTc as length (right: 11.5 +/- 2.2 mm, left: 11.8 +/- 1.7 mm),width (right: 6.4 +/- 1.2 mm, left: 5.4 +/- 0.8 mm), height (right: 4.5 +/- 0.9mm, left: 4.5 +/- 0.8 mm), attenuation (right: 33.1 +/- 5.0 Hounsfield units,left: 32.5 +/- 5.3 Hounsfield units) and position, but markedly moremineralization (right: 10%, left: 13.3%) than reported in healthy cats. Thisstudy provides references of aCTc for diseased cats without evidence of adrenaldisease. The result suggests that adrenal incidentalomas seem to be rare in cats.

LID - 10.5326/JAAHA-MS-7151 [doi]
AB  - A 2 mo old domestic shorthair kitten was presented for acute respiratory distressand severe ambulatory difficulties. Thoracic radiography revealed hyperinflation of the left cranial lung lobe and a mass with soft-tissue/gas opacity in thecaudal mediastinum, leading to the suspicion of congenital lung lobe emphysemaand hiatal hernia. Decreased bone radiopacity and suspected pathologicalfractures were also present. Complete clinicopathological analyses showedsignificant ionized hypocalcemia and suspicion of secondary hyperparathyroidismrelated to an inadequate diet. Lung lobectomy and reduction of the hiatal hernia following a median sternotomy and a cranial laparotomy were performed. IV andoral supplementation of calcium led to a full recovery and improvement in thekitten's walking. A histopathological analysis revealed pulmonary emphysemaassociated with hypoplastic and irregular bronchial cartilage. Congenital lobaremphysema is a rare disease in both humans and animals. This is the firstveterinary report describing a kitten affected by congenital lobar emphysemacombined with a hiatal hernia and additionally complicated by secondarynutritional hyperparathyroidism with a good long-term outcome.

LID - 10.5326/JAAHA-MS-7201 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the complication risk and prevalenceafter phacoemulsification in cats with presumed congenital/inherited cataracts.Twelve client-owned cats were included in the study. This retrospective studyspanned 13 yr and involved 22 eyes. The median age at the time of surgery was 15 mo (range: 4.5-168 mo of age). Recorded complications were 3 eyes developedpostoperative ocular hypertension, 1 eye developed glaucoma, 7 eyes developedfeline herpes virus-1 signs, and 7 eyes developed postoperative uveitis >2 wkafter surgery. No eyes had developed intraocular sarcomas at the time of theirlast exam. All eyes remained visual at last follow-up (range: 0.5-121 mo).Success was defined as a comfortable and visual eye without intraocularneoplasia, glaucoma, a partial or complete retinal detachment, or uveitis thatoccurred >2 wk after surgery or persisted longer than 2 wk. Twenty-one out of 22 eyes had a successful outcome. In this study, cats with presumedcongenital/juvenile cataracts who underwent phacoemulsification had an excellent outcome.

TI  - Resistivity and pulsatility indexes in feline kidney disease: a systematicreview.
PG  - 306-318
LID - 10.1111/vru.13102 [doi]
AB  - Doppler ultrasonography is used in the evaluation of hemodynamics, and theresistivity (RI) and pulsatility (PI) indexes provide information aboutresistance to blood flow within a vessel. This systematic review was carried out to evaluate renal RI and PI in clinically healthy and nonsedated cats and as wellas their usefulness in the evaluation of kidney disease in cats. An electronicsearch in the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases was carried out using the terms "resistive index" or "resistivity index" or "pulsatility index;""Doppler;" "renal" or "kidney;" and "cat" or "feline" in titles, abstracts, andkeywords. Variables of interest related to experimental model features, research methods, and technical resources were extracted from the studies. Themethodological quality was assessed with SYRCLE's risk of bias tool. Thus, 14studies involving healthy and sick cats were selected. Interestingly, the upperlimits estimated for both RI and PI varied among studies. The upper limits ofrenal RI for healthy cats varied between 0.64 and 0.72, while for PI, the values varied from 1.06 to 1.29. A limited number of studies evaluated cats with kidney disease. In most studies, RI values of kidneys with different conditions weresignificantly different from kidneys of healthy animals, indicating that RIvalues increase with kidney disease. The parameters body weight, heart rate, and age seem to influence the RI values. Standardized studies regarding itsrealization and description are still necessary to define normal values andanalyze its applicability in the clinical diagnostic routine.

AB  - Growth differentiation factor-9 (GDF-9), an oocyte-derived member of the TGF-betasuperfamily, plays an essential role in regulation of follicular development.This study aimed to determine the cyclic changes in serum GDF-9 concentration,compare its levels before and after ovariohysterectomy (OHE), and investigate itspotential as a tool in ovarian remnant syndrome (ORS) diagnosis in cats. GDF-9measurements were performed on 50 cats referred for routine OHE. The stage of theestrous cycle was determined by vaginal cytology and measurement of serumestradiol and progesterone levels was carried out to detect the cyclic changes incirculating GDF-9. One week after OHE, serum samples were collected again from 30cats to reveal differences in GDF-9 levels. GDF-9 levels in the follicular phase were significantly higher than those in the interestrus (p0.05). Thepostoperative analysis could be performed. GDF-9 levels slightly decreased oneweek after OHE (p=0.053). In conclusion, blood GDF-9 levels change during theestrous cycle, and may decrease with age in cats. However, further studies areneeded to reveal the efficiency of GDF-9 in ORS diagnosis.

PG  - 67-73
LID - 10.24425/pjvs.2022.140842 [doi]
AB  - Cutaneous adverse food reaction (CAFR) is a common disease, affecting about 1-2% of dogs and cats. Diagnosis of the CAFR is made through elimination diet coupled with diet challenge, as methods like skin tests, patch tests, basophildegranulation tests and assessment of IgG and IgE serum levels are not sensitive enough. A partially hydrolysed salmon and pea hypoallergenic diet was evaluatedin the diagnosis and treatment of CAFR in dogs and cats. The diet was used in thetreatment of 13 dogs and 12 cats for 10 weeks. The Pruritus Visual Analog Scale(PVAS; dogs and cats), Canine Atopic Dermatitis Extent and Severity Index(CADESI-04; dogs) and the Scoring Feline Allergic Dermatitis (SCORFAD; cats) wereused for effectiveness evaluation. In dogs, a significant decrease was reportedin both CADESI-04 (from 17.3+/-7.5 to 10.15+/-7.4; p=0.028) and PVAS (from7+/-1.3 to 4.76+/-1.8; p=0.003) after four weeks of treatment. Also in cats, boththe PVAS (from 6.75+/-1.8 to 4+/-2.3; p=0.006) and SCORFAD (from 4.16+/-1.9 to2.58+/-1.2; p=0.029) decreased significantly after four weeks. After eight weeks,a significant improvement was observed in almost all the animals. Evaluated diet was useful in the treatment of the CAFR in dogs and cats.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to evaluate the cutaneous trunci muscle reflex (CTMR)in healthy cats using methods performed by the clinician and the cat's owner athome. METHODS: A total of 55 healthy cats without neurological abnormalities wereincluded in this study. CTMR evaluation was performed sequentially in each catusing three methods by a clinician: method A, pinch skin with a straight 14 cmCrile haemostat forceps; method B, displace fur with the tip of a pen orhaemostat forceps; and method C, poke skin with the tip of a straightened paperclip. The normal response rates for each method were obtained and compared. A'CTMR performance score' was assigned for each cat, reflecting the presence of a normal CTMR response using one or more of the three methods. An 'ownerperformance score' was also obtained, reflecting the response of the CTMR whenperformed at home by the cat owner. The two scores were compared as paired datafor each cat. RESULTS: The CTMR was elicited normally in 17 (31%), 27 (49%) and16 (29%) cats using methods A, B and C, respectively. Method B delivered asignificantly higher percentage of normal responses. When comparing the 'CTMRperformance score' and 'owner performance score', the percentage of normalresponses was 60% and 100%, respectively, which was significantly different.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The overall normal response rate of the CTMR inhealthy feline subjects was low when performed by a clinician, regardless of the method applied. Conversely, a high percentage of normal responses was obtained bycat owners performing CTMR at home, potentially indicating the impact of stresson the CTMR performance.

TI  - Exploring Finger Digit Ratios (2D:4D) in Surgeons, Professional Rugby Players,and Political Journalists to Form a Directional Hypothesis: Could Finger LengthPredict Attention and Focus?
PG  - 873129
LID - 10.3389/fnbeh.2022.873129 [doi]
AB  - In this short report we explore the predictive nature of finger digit ratio(i.e., second/index finger length divided by fourth/ring finger length; 2D:4D)and achievement. This research, with niche and specialized populations, wasintended to support and grow on knowledge obtained from other large population2D:4D studies and help form a directional hypothesis for future work exploringfinger digit ratio and "success." Twenty-nine professional rugby players aged25.1 +/- 4.2 years, height 185.2 +/- 6.3 cm and weight 101.9 +/- 11.8 kg; n = 16 orthopedic surgeons aged 55.3 +/- 9.3 years with height 183.8 +/- 10.2 cm andweight 90.8 +/- 14.0 kg; and n = 18 political journalists with age, height andweight of 38.8 +/- 7.3 years, 182.8 +/- 7.8 cm, and 84.4 +/- 11.4 kg,respectively, were recruited. Three experiments were conducted where we (1)explored relationships for 2D:4D with testosterone and cortisol responsiveness tolow stress exercise, (2) explored relationships for 2D:4D with pupil constrictionand pupil constriction latency (pupillometry measures related to testosterone andcortisol responsiveness and to attentiveness), and (3) compared 2D:4D betweenrugby players, surgeons, and journalists. Our results revealed 2D:4D was notpredictive of testosterone and cortisol responsiveness to low-level exercisestress. However, relationships exist for 2D:4D and pupillometry measures (p <0.05). Journalists right minus left 2D:4D difference was significantly different to rugby players' and surgeons (p < 0.05). We argue 2D:4D is likely predictive oftestosterone sensitivity and associated ability to focus attention; a skillimportant to high achievement in various contexts.

AB  - Toxoplasmosis is an important zoonotic disease worldwide caused by theintracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Cats, being hosts, act as a goodsentinel for this disease. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine theseroprevalence of T. gondii in cats by examining serum from seven districts ofMetropolitan Lima, Peru. We collected and analyzed 303 cat serum samples, and theowners answered a questionnaire about age, gender, lifestyle (indoors only andoutdoors access) and feeding (commercial and home food). The samples were tested using indirect hemagglutination (IHA) for detection of antibody IgM and IgG.Among the animals analyzed, we found 52 (17.2%, 95% CI: 13.1% - 21.9%)seropositive cats to T. gondii, of which one corresponded to acute infection(IgM) and 51 to chronic infections (IgG). In addition, the presence of anti-T.gondii antibodies was associated with feeding commercial food and living outdoorsaccess. Our results concluded that T. gondii infections are common in cats withowners in Metropolitan Lima and will be useful to future epidemiological studies.

TI  - A case report of fatal feline babesiosis caused by Babesia canis in north westernSpain.
PG  - 177
LID - 10.1186/s12917-022-03287-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Europe, Babesia infections in cats are sporadic and only partialknowledge is currently available since the number of described cases includingboth the clinical presentation and the molecular identification of the Babesiaspecies involved is limited. In the present case report, the clinical signs, the epidemiological data and the molecular results suggest that this is the firstreported fatal case of feline babesiosis caused by Babesia canis. CASEPRESENTATION: A six month old female European shorthair cat from north-westernSpain died after being hospitalized for two days. This animal was pregnant andshowed anorexia, lethargy, weakness, jaundice and fever with increasedrespiratory and heart rates. Haematological analysis revealed haemolyticregenerative anaemia, thrombocytopenia and leukocytosis. The presence ofpiroplasms was assessed using a PCR targeting the 18S rRNA gene of Babesia spp.and Theileria spp.; the sample resulted positive and B. canis was identified byDNA sequence analysis. The possible existence of co-infections with othervector-borne pathogens such as Anaplasma spp., Bartonella spp., Borreliaburgdorferi s.l., Cytauxzoon spp., Ehrlichia spp., Hepatozoon canis, Mycoplasmaspp. or Rickettsia spp. was excluded by qPCR. CONCLUSIONS: Our results togetherwith previous reports on Babesia infections in cats from Europe suggest thatfeline babesiosis should be included in the differential diagnosis of animalswith anaemia, thrombocytopenia, anorexia and lethargy, especially in young orimmunocompromised animals from endemic areas for canine babesiosis.

AB  - A three-month-old, male intact Norwegian forest cat without any clinical signswas referred to the cardiology service of the author's teaching hospital forevaluation of a cardiac murmur. The murmur was systolic with an intensity of 4out of 6 with the point of maximal intensity at the left heart base.Echocardiography revealed a moderate mitral valve regurgitation and a moderatedynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction both resulting from systolicanterior motion of the mitral valve (SAM). Moreover, left ventricular concentric hypertrophy was noted. Oral atenolol therapy was initiated. Recheck examination3.5 months later revealed unchanged murmur characteristics in the stillasymptomatic kitten. Echocardiography showed no SAM, but there was a severe fixedaortic stenosis apparent caused by a discrete supravalvular lesion, 4 mm distalto the valve, with an hourglass morphology. Supravalvular aortic stenosis is arare congenital anomaly in cats, which has not been reported antemortem yet.

TI  - Compartment-Specific Differences in the Activation of Monocyte Subpopulations AreNot Affected by Nitric Oxide and Glucocorticoid Treatment in a Model ofResuscitated Porcine Endotoxemic Shock.

LID - 10.3390/jcm11092641 [doi]
AB  - Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) remains one of the treatment modalities in shock, and in addition to its vasoactive properties, iNO exerts immunomodulatory effects. Weused a porcine model of endotoxemia with shock resuscitation (control) andadditional treatment with iNO and a steroid (treatment group). After 20 h, bonemarrow (BM), peripheral blood (PB), and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were collected to analyze the immunophenotype and mitochondrial membrane potential(Deltaphi) in three subsets of monocytes. In both groups, SLA-DR expressiondecreased twofold on the circulating CD14(+)CD163(+) and CD14(-)CD163(+)monocytes, while it did not change on the CD14(+)CD163(+). Deltaphi increasedonly in the CD14(-)CD163(+) subpopulation (0.8 vs. 2.0, p &lt; 0.001). Theanalysis of compartment-specific alterations showed that nearly 100% of BALFCD14(+)CD163(+) and CD14(-)CD163(+) monocytes expressed SLA-DR, and it was highercompared to PB (32% and 20%, p &lt; 0.0001) and BM (93% and 67%, p &lt; 0.001,respectively) counterparts. BALF CD14(+)CD163(+) had a threefold higher Deltaphi than PB and BM monocytes, while the Deltaphi of the other subsets was highest in PB monocytes. We confirmed the compartmentalization of the monocyte responseduring endotoxemic shock, which highlights the importance of studyingtissue-resident cells in addition to their circulating counterparts. TheiNO/steroid treatment did not further impair monocyte fitness.

TI  - Nesting Site and Plumage Color Are the Main Traits Associated with Bird SpeciesPresence in Urban Areas.

LID - 10.3390/ani12091148 [doi]
AB  - Urban areas are expected to grow in the next decades, filtering bird species fromthe regional pool based on their life history traits. Although the impact ofurbanization on traits such as diet, habitat and migratory behavior has beenanalyzed, their joint role with other traits related to plumage color has not yetbeen analyzed. Urban characteristics such as impervious surfaces, human presence and pollutants may be related to dark and uniform plumages. The objective of thisstudy is to determine different bird species responses to urbanization usingordination analysis, and to characterize their life history traits combininginformation about diet, habitat and plumage color. Birds were surveyed alongurban-rural gradients located in three cities of central Argentina. Speciesassociations with urban characteristics were assessed through principal componentanalysis. Two axes were obtained: the first related positively to urbanexploiters and negatively to urban avoiders, and a second axis related negativelyto urban adapters. The scores of each axis were related to species traits throughphylogenetic generalized least squares models. Species identified as 'urbanexploiters' tended to nest in buildings and have uniform plumage, whereas thoseidentified as 'urban avoiders' tended to be ground-nesting species with variable plumage. A third type, 'urban adapters', tended to be tree-nesting species with alow diet breadth, intermediate plumage lightness, low presence of plumage sexual dimorphism and high presence of iridescence. The results suggest that nestpredation and habitat loss may exclude ground nesting birds from urban areas. Thehigh density of pedestrians and domestic animals, such as cats and dogs, in urbancenters may favor uniform plumages in birds that enhance camouflage.

TI  - Home Range and Activity Patterns of Free-Ranging Cats: A Case Study from aChinese University Campus.
LID - 1141 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12091141 [doi]
AB  - Human activities and the available resources influence the home range andactivity patterns of free-ranging cats. Our objective in this study was todetermine sex and breeding season vs. non-breeding season home range size, aswell as activity patterns for unowned free-ranging cats at a university campus inChina. Twenty-nine adult cats (fifteen males and fourteen females) were trackedwith attached GPS units from October 2018 to June 2020. We considered the effectsof sex and breeding status on the home range size of free-ranging cats. Male catshad larger home ranges (95% KDE: 12.60 +/- 2.61 ha) than female cats (95% KDE:5.02 +/- 1.34 ha) in the breeding season. There was a seasonal effect on the homerange size of male cats; for example, during the non-breeding season, the homerange (95% KDE: 6.68 +/- 1.22 ha) was smaller than that during the breedingseason (95% KDE: 12.60 +/- 2.61 ha), while female cats tended to have larger homeranges in the non-breeding season (95% KDE: 7.73 +/- 2.77 ha) than in thebreeding season (95% KDE: 5.02 +/- 1.34 ha). We used the number of activity stepsto measure the activity intensity of cats to explore their activity patterns. Themean (+/-SE) number of steps a cat takes per day was 19,863.96 +/- 1627.21. Therewere two peak periods of activity in a day, 6:00-10:00 and 17:00-21:00. Our studyprovided a case study of the home range and activity patterns of free-rangingcats living on a Chinese university campus, and the results show that the homerange of free-ranging cats is affected by the breeding status and sex, andfree-ranging cats have more intense activities at twilight and relatively loweractivity intensity in the afternoon. The results provided theoretical support forthe management and conservation implications of free-ranging cats in cities.

LID - 10.3390/ani12091072 [doi]
AB  - This study investigates whether the measurement of glucocorticoid metabolites(GCMs) in feces is a useful method for the noninvasive evaluation of stress inthe endangered Tsushima leopard cats (Prionailurus bengalensis euptilurus). Feceswere collected from six seemingly healthy and five diseased (renal dysfunction,adrenal tumor, hernia, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline leukemia virus(FeLV)) Tsushima leopard cats in captivity. Fecal GCMs were measured by enzymeimmunoassay (EIA) for cortisol. Individuals that experienced a physicalexamination under anesthesia showed increased fecal GCMs 1-2 days after theevent. An individual diagnosed with disk herniation showed decreased fecal GCMsafter medical administration. The mean fecal GCM concentrations for six healthyanimals and five diseased animals were 0.66 +/- 0.08 and 2.65 +/- 0.76 mug/g,respectively, which was significantly different. Cortisol and corticosterone werenot clearly detected in the feces examined by the use of the HPLC-EIA analysis.GCMs may be excreted in the feces; however, the exact identification of thesesubstances is not achieved. The results suggest that the measurement of fecalGCMs is useful for the husbandry and health management of this species.

AB  - Pet ownership literature remains mixed regarding associations with mental andphysical health outcomes among older adults. The present study investigates therelationship between pet ownership and depression, health, and physical activity in an older adult sample balanced by sex (male/female), race (White/Black), andurban/rural status. Participants were adults aged 65+ recruited between 1999 and 2001 in the University of Alabama at Birmingham Study of Aging. Participantscompleted the Geriatric Depression Scale, a single-item self-reported healthmeasure, and a physical activity questionnaire. Dog owners reported bettersubjective health and were more likely to walk for exercise as compared tonon-pet owners. Cat owners did not differ from non-pet owners in terms ofself-reported health or walking. White participants were more likely than Blackparticipants to report ownership of a pet. No relationships were found betweenpet ownership and symptoms of depression. Findings were not influenced by sex,race, or geographical location. Dog ownership may be associated with positivephysical health behaviors and subjective health perceptions. Additional research focused on mechanisms and cognitive impact is needed. Although there may bephysical health benefits of dog ownership, adopting a pet should not be viewed asa simplistic solution to alleviating depression in older adults.

AB  - Lyme disease (LD) is the most common vector-borne disease in the USA. Beyond its tick-borne nature, however, risk factors for LD are poorly understood. We used anonline questionnaire to compare LD patients and non-LD counterparts and elucidatefactors associated with LD. We investigated demographic, lifestyle, and householdcharacteristics and use of prevention measures. Associations with LD were modeledusing logistic regression, and average marginal effects were estimated. In total,185 active or past LD patients and 139 non-patients participated. The majority ofrespondents were white (95%) and female (65%). Controlling for age, sex, and typeof residential area, pet ownership was associated with an 11.1% (p = 0.038)increase in the probability of LD. This effect was limited to cat owners (OR:2.143, p = 0.007; dog owners, OR: 1.398, p = 0.221). Living in rural areas wasassociated with a 36% (p = 0.001) increase in the probability of LD compared toliving in an urban area. Participants who reported knowing someone with LymeDisease were more likely to wear insect repellant and perform tick checks. Thisstudy suggests opportunities for improved LD prevention, including advising catowners of their increased risk. Although patterns in adoption of LD preventionmethods remain poorly understood, concern about LD risk does motivate their use.

AB  - Recent surface forces apparatus experiments that measured the forces between two mica surfaces and a series of subsequent theoretical studies suggest theoccurrence of universal underscreening in highly concentrated electrolytesolutions. We performed a set of systematic Atomic Force Spectroscopymeasurements for aqueous salt solutions in a concentration range from 1 mM to 5 Musing chloride salts of various alkali metals as well as mixed concentrated salt solutions (involving both mono- and divalent cations and anions), that mimicconcentrated brines typically encountered in geological formations. Experimentswere carried out using flat substrates and submicrometer-sized colloidal probesmade of smooth oxidized silicon immersed in salt solutions at pH values of 6 and 9 and temperatures of 25 degrees C and 45 degrees C. While strong repulsiveforces were observed for the smallest tip-sample separations, none of theconditions explored displayed any indication of anomalous long rangeelectrostatic forces as reported for mica surfaces. Instead, forces areuniversally dominated by attractive van der Waals interactions at tip-sampleseparations of approximately 2 nm and beyond for salt concentrations of 1 M andhigher. Complementary calculations based on classical density functional theoryfor the primitive model support these experimental observations and display aconsistent decrease in screening length with increasing ion concentration.

AB  - An electrochemical immunosensor for the accurate detection of cat neutrophilgelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) in urine samples based on an electrodewith a monolayer of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) was proposed in this study. Tofabricate the sensing electrode, a nickel mold with concave micron hemispherearray was prepared and then used to transfer the micron hemispherical structureonto a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film using the hot embossing technique. Agold thin film was sputtered onto the micron hemispherical structure array, afterwhich 1,6-hexanedithol and AuNPs were uniformly deposited on the PET membrane to form a sensing electrode. The NGAL concentrations were measured byelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy after attaching the anti-NGAL. Resultsrevealed that the proposed sensing scheme exhibited a wide dynamic detectionrange from 1 to 100 ng/mL, which is far enough to distinguish the healthy (NGALconcentration <10 ng/mL) from the damaged kidney. A low limit of detection andhigh sensitivity of 0.47 ng/mL and 10261.8 Omega ng(-1)mL, respectively, werealso measured. After performing real sample detection using urine samples fromcats collected at a veterinary hospital, the results confirmed that the proposed NGAL detection approach in this research could accurately detect theconcentration of NGAL in cat urine samples.

TI  - Combining radiation therapy with zoledronate for the treatment of osteo-invasive feline oral squamous cell carcinoma.
LID - 10.1111/vco.12830 [doi]
AB  - Feline oral squamous cell carcinoma (FOSCC) is the most common oral tumourdiagnosed in pet cats and carries a poor prognosis with <10% one-year survivaldespite multi-modal therapies. Tumours of the mandible or maxilla are frequently osteo-invasive and pain can result from osteolysis. Zoledronate is abisphosphonate that inhibits osteoclasts and reduces bone resorption. Radiationtherapy (RT) is used to treat FOSCC due to anti-cancer activity and ability toimprove quality of life. We hypothesized RT can be safely combined withzoledronate, and that this combinatory therapy would be efficacious, welltolerated, and result in decreased bone resorption in cats with FOSCC. SCCF1 cellline was treated with zoledronate before, concurrently, or after RT, andclonogenic assays were performed to determine if an optimal dosing schedule wouldbe identified. Nine cats with osteoinvasive FOSCC were recruited for treatmentwith 4 weekly doses of 8 Gy RT combined with zoledronate administered at thefirst and fourth treatments. Serial CT scans were performed to assess tumourresponse. Safety and tolerability were monitored with hematologic and biochemicalparameters, and acute radiation effects were characterized. Serum c-telopeptide(CTx) and relative bone mineral density (rBMD) by dual -energy X-rayabsorptiometry (DEXA) quantified bone resorption. In vitro studies showed noclear benefit to timing of zoledronate with RT, therefore all zoledronate wasadministered concurrently with RT in FOSCC patients. Based on tumour volume, 4/9 (44.4%) cats achieved partial remission, 4/9 (44.4%) stable disease and 1/9(11.1%) had progressive disease. The combinatory therapy was well-tolerated basedon biochemical measurements, and all patients experienced decreased serum CTx.Combining RT with zoledronate in tumour-bearing cats is safe, well-tolerated,results in a partial remission rate of up to 44%, and decreases serum CTx, amarker of bone resorption.

TI  - Quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the hippocampal cytoarchitecture inadult cats with regard to the pathological diagnosis of hippocampal sclerosis.
PG  - e0268010
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0268010 [doi]
AB  - Cats are known to be affected by hippocampal sclerosis, potentially causingantiseizure drug(s) resistance. In order to lay the foundation for astandardized, systematic classification and diagnosis of this pathology in cats, this prospective study aimed at evaluating normal reference values of cellulardensities and the cytoarchitecture of the feline hippocampus. Three transversesections (head, body and tail) of each left hippocampus were obtained from 17non-epileptic cats of different brachycephalic and mesocephalic breeds and ageclasses (range: 3-17 years). Histological (hematoxylin and eosin, Nissl) andimmunohistochemical (NeuN, GFAP) staining was performed to investigate neuron andastroglial cell populations, as well as the layer thickness of the pyramidal celllayer and granule cell layer. Significant differences in neuronal density (inCA2-CA4 and the granule cell layer) and layer thickness (in CA1-CA3 and thegranule cell layer) were evidenced throughout the longitudinal hippocampal axis(p<0.05); on the other hand, the astrocyte density did not differ. Moreover,reference ranges were defined for these parameters in the pyramidal cell layerand in the granule cell layer. The findings did not differ according to breed or age. In veterinary medicine these parameters have not been evaluated in cats sofar. As surgical treatment may become a therapeutic option for cats with temporallobe epilepsy, estimating normal values of the hippocampal cytoarchitecture will help in the standardized histopathological examination of resected hippocampalspecimens to reach a diagnosis of hippocampal sclerosis.

TI  - One hundred years of insulin: Is it time for smart?
LID - 10.1111/jsap.13507 [doi]
AB  - Smarter understanding of diabetes pathophysiology and pharmacology of insulintherapy can lead to better clinical outcomes. Rather than looking for an insulin formulation that is considered "best" for a general population, it could beappropriate to seek the "smart" insulin choice, tailored to the specific clinicalsituation. Different treatment goals should be considered, with pros and cons to each. Ideally, insulin therapy in most diabetic dogs should mimic a "basal-bolus"pattern. The "intermediate"-acting insulin formulations might provide better"bolus" treatment in dogs than the rapid-acting formulations used in people. Inpatients with some residual beta cell function such as many diabetic cats,administering only a "basal" insulin might lead to complete normalisation ofblood glucose concentrations. Insulin suspensions (neutral protamine Hagedorn,neutral protamine Hagedorn/regular mixes, lente and protamine zinc insulin) aswell as insulin glargine U100 and detemir are "intermediate"-acting formulations that are administered twice daily. For a formulation to be an effective and safe "basal" insulin, its action should be roughly the same every hour of the day.Currently, only insulin glargine U300 and insulin degludec meet this standard in dogs, whereas in cats, insulin glargine U300 is the closest option.

AB  - The infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus in cats and dogs raised issue ofhuman-to-animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in domestic pets in close contactswith their owners. Our study was designed to research this in the framework ofBosnia and Herzegovina. Using ELISA, AFIAS fluorescent immunoassay, RT-qPCR andWGS on Nanopore MinION platform with ARTIC Network Amplicon sequencing protocolfor SARS-CoV-2, we showed that three out of thirteen dogs and one out of fivecats from the households with confirmed human cases of COVID-19 inBosnia-Herzegovina were infected with SARS-CoV-2. The high viral RNA load wasdetected in samples collected from a 4-year-old male Havanese (Ct = 12.52), a6-year-old German Shepherd (Ct = 21.36) and a 9-year-old female AmericanStaffordshire terrier (Ct = 25.74). The antibody response in dogs and one cat wasobserved. The viral genetic sequences from dogs were identical to the sequencesdetected in the owners suggesting the human-to-animal transmission of the virus. These findings, especially the low initial Ct values detected, from the publichealth perspective additionally stress the need for precautionary measures toprotect both humans and animals.

TI  - Case Report: Articular Gout in Four Dogs and One Cat.
PG  - 752774
LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.752774 [doi]
AB  - Background: There is widespread prejudice in veterinary medicine that gout doesnot occur in non-human mammalians. However, we recently discovered monosodiumurate crystals in the synovial fluid obtained from a few dogs and a cat. Since itis the definitive and gold standard to diagnose gout, we report these cases asnewly emerging diseases in companion animals. Case Presentation: Four dogs andone cat were presented at our hospital because of lameness due to an unknowncause. Even after the routine examinations, including radiographic imaging,laboratory examination, and arthrocentesis, we were unable to find a clear cause of polyarthritis. However, we later discovered monosodium urate crystals in thesynovial fluid of the animals, confirmed by polarized microscopy. In one of thetwo dogs treated with immunosuppressants, the disease relapsed, and the other didnot show any symptoms for 3 months. The other two dogs were treated with xanthineoxidase inhibitor, where one died, and the other did not show any symptoms for 3 years. The cat was treated with drainage and intra-articular dexamethasoneinjection, but the disease recurred after 6 months. Conclusion: This is the firstreport to confirm that articular gout can occur in dogs and cats. Care must betaken not to neglect needle-shaped materials in the synovial fluid. Gout shouldalso be included in the differential diagnosis of arthritis and further research is needed in these animals.

AB  - High-frequency vibration of the tendon provides potent activation of Ia afferentstime-locked to the stimulation frequency and provides excitatory ionotropicactivation of homonymous motor pools. In cats, the evoked motor unit discharge isconstrained to discharge at integer multiples of the vibration frequency,resulting in a probability of discharge that is highly punctuated. Here wequantify the robustness of this punctuated response in the cat and evaluatewhether it is present in the human. Soleus electromyography (EMG) was collectedfrom eight cats using 64 channel electrodes during three modes of motoneuronactivation. First, tendon vibration parameters were modified. Second, secondaryreflex inputs are applied concurrently with tendon vibration. Third, the state ofthe spinal cord was altered through pharmacological or surgical manipulations.Analogous surface high-density EMG was collected from the lower leg of six humansduring both vibration evoked and matched volitional contractions. Array EMGsignals from both the cat and human were decomposed into corresponding motor unitaction potential spike trains, and the punctuation in discharge was quantified.In the cat, regardless of vibration parameters, secondary synaptic drive, andstate of spinal circuitry, focal tendon vibration evoked punctuated motor unitdischarge. However, in the human lower limb, the vibration-evoked contractions donot produce punctuated motor unit discharge.

AB  - Parvovirus infections in dogs and cats are restricted to highly mitoticallyactive tissues, predominantly to the epithelium of the gastrointestinal tractand, in cases of prenatal infections in cats, also to Purkinje cell neuroblasts. The evidence of parvovirus-infected mature feline neurons gave rise to reconsiderthe dogma of post-mitotically fixed and terminally differentiated neurons in the adult central nervous system. To elucidate the postulated capability of certainterminally differentiated feline neurons to re-enter the cell cycle,immunohistochemical double labeling using the transcription factor Sox2 and thetumor suppressor and cell cycle regulator retinoblastoma protein in itsphosphorylated state (pRb) was performed. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embeddedbrain tissue negative for parvovirus-antigen from 14 cats was compared to braintissue from 13 cats with immunohistochemically confirmed cerebral parvovirusinfection; the 27 cats were aged between 50 days of gestation (E50) and 5 years. Both groups revealed nuclear Sox2 and pRb immunosignals in numerous neurons,suggesting a more active state than mature neurons should have. Accordingly,parvovirus is not exclusively involved in the reactivation of the cell cyclemachinery in those post-mitotic, terminally differentiated feline neurons.

TI  - Occupational risk of cutaneous larva migrans: A case report and a systematicliterature review.
PG  - e0010330
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010330 [doi]
AB  - Cutaneous larva migrans (CLM) is a parasitic zoonosis of warm tropical andsubtropical areas, although autochthonous cases have been increasingly reportedin Western European countries. Data on the prevalence of CLM as an occupationaldisease in workers exposed to potentially contaminated soil or in close contactwith dogs and cats are scant. Herein, we report an autochthonous case of CLM in adog breeder from southern Italy (Apulia region), along with a systematicliterature review describing the risk of CLM infection, mainly according to jobcategories. The patient was referred to the dermatology unit presenting aserpiginous lesion on his hand, raising the suspected CLM diagnosis. Innon-endemic areas, CLM might represent a challenge for physicians in terms ofdiagnosis, treatment, and prevention, particularly in workplaces. Themultidisciplinary approach in the diagnosis of CLM with the involvement ofdifferent scientific competences (i.e., dermatologists, veterinarians, andoccupational physicians) may contribute to further assess the distribution ofhuman CLM and associated risk factors, toward reducing the risk for theinfection.

PG  - 7851
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-11973-4 [doi]
AB  - The public health problem of tick-borne diseases has attracted much attention in recent years due to an increasing incidence in humans and animals. The aim ofthis study was to compare the risk of exposure to ticks and tick-borne infectionsin dogs and cats in recreational and urbanized areas in the Lesser Poland andSilesian Provinces. For molecular testing for the presence of the selectedpathogens, 207 I. ricinus females collected from 119 dogs and 50 cats, and 2 I.hexagonus females collected from 2 domestic dogs, were examined. Overall, A.phagocytophilum was found in 3.7% of the I. ricinus specimens, B. microti in27.1%, and B. burgdorferi s.l. in 0.9%. In urban areas of both provinces, A.phagocytophilum was found in 4.8% of the I. ricinus specimens, B. microti in41.6% and B. burgdorferi s.l. in 3.9%. Pathogens were detected B. microti in bothstudied I. hexagonus specimens. These findings may indicate the important rolethat these animals play in the circulation of these pathogens in nature.

PG  - e142-e152
LID - 10.1177/1098612X221094663 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to determine whether cardiogenic pleuraleffusion in cats is associated with a lower risk of arterial thromboembolism(ATE) compared with cats with cardiac disease without evidence of pleuraleffusion. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on owned cats withnatural occurring cardiac diseases. Cats included were classified in threegroups: those with cardiac disease but no evidence of congestive heart failure(CHF); those with evidence of cardiogenic pulmonary oedema; and those withevidence of cardiogenic pleural effusion. Prevalence of ATE was calculated andthe variables analysed for an association with this outcome were the presence andtype of CHF, sex and neuter status, age, breed, type of cardiac diseases and leftatrial (LA) dimension. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to fit the association between ATE and these variables. RESULTS: A total of 366 catswith cardiac disease met the inclusion criteria: 179 were included in the groupwith cardiac disease but no evidence of CHF, 66 in the group with evidence ofcardiogenic pulmonary oedema and 121 in the group with evidence of cardiogenicpleural effusion. Prevalence of ATE (58/366 [15.8%]) was significantly different among groups (with no evidence of CHF, 28/179 [15.6%]; with evidence ofcardiogenic pulmonary oedema, 22/66 [33.3%]; with evidence of cardiogenic pleuraleffusion, 8/121 [6.6%]; P <0.001). Cats with ATE had a significantly higher LA toaortic root ratio (2.30 +/- 0.46) than those without ATE (2.04 +/- 0.46; P<0.001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated that the group withevidence of cardiogenic pleural effusion was associated with a lower risk ofdeveloping ATE compared with groups with cardiac disease but no evidence of CHFand with evidence of cardiogenic pulmonary oedema (P = 0.005 and P <0.001,respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Presence of cardiogenic pleuraleffusion is associated with a lower risk of developing ATE, while LA enlargement is a risk factor for ATE.

TI  - Occurrence and bacterial loads of Bartonella and haemotropic Mycoplasma speciesin privately owned cats and dogs and their fleas from East and Southeast Asia.
LID - 10.1111/zph.12959 [doi]
AB  - Bartonella spp. and haemoplasmas are pathogens of veterinary and medical interestwith ectoparasites mainly involved in their transmission. This study aimed atmolecular detection of Bartonella spp. and haemoplasmas in cats (n = 93) and dogs(n = 96), and their related fleas (n = 189) from countries in East and Southeast Asia. Ctenocephalides felis was the dominant flea species infesting both cats(97.85%) and dogs (75%) followed by Ctenocephalides orientis in dogs (18.75%) andrarely in cats (5.2%). Bartonella spp. DNA was only detected in blood samples of flea-infested cats (21.51%) (p < .0001, OR = 27.70) with Bartonella henselae morefrequently detected than Bartonella clarridgeiae in cat hosts (15.05%, 6.45%) andtheir associated fleas (17.24%, 13.79%). Out of three Bartonella-positive fleasfrom dogs, two Ct. orientis fleas carried Bartonella vinsonii subsp. berkhoffiiand Bartonella clarridgeiae, while the 3rd flea (Ct. felis) carried CandidatusBartonella merieuxii. Felines represented a risk factor for Bartonella spp.infections, where fleas collected from cats (32.25%) presented an increasedlikelihood for Bartonella spp. occurrence (p < .0001, OR = 14.76) than those fromdogs (3.13%). Moreover, when analysing infectious status, higher Bartonella spp. DNA loads were detected in fleas from bacteraemic cats compared to those fromnon-bacteraemic ones (p < .05). The haemoplasma occurrence was 16.13% (15/93) and4.17% (4/96) in cat and dog blood samples from different countries (i.e.Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand), with cats more atrisk of infection (p < .01, OR = 5.96) than dogs. Unlike Bartonella spp., therewas no evidence for flea involvement in the hemoplasmas' transmission cycle, thussupporting the hypothesis of non-vectorial transmission for these pathogens. Inconclusion, client-owned cats and dogs living in East and Southeast Asiacountries are exposed to vector-borne pathogens with fleas from cats playing akey role in Bartonella spp. transmission, thus posing a high risk of infectionfor humans sharing the same environment.

AB  - The gut mycobiome exhibits major influence on the gastrointestinal health anddisease but received less attention due to low abundance. This studycharacterizes the fungal community and compares the microbial diversity betweenindoor and outdoor cats. Genomic DNA was extracted and sequenced by targeting theInternal Transcribed Spacer 1 (ITS1) region using Flongle flow cell on MinIONsequencing platform. Results show the phylum Ascomycota and genus Peniophorellawere numerous in indoor cats, whereas the Basidiomycota and Pichia were abundant in outdoor cats. Peniophorella formed the core mycobiome in both felinepopulations. Furthermore, alpha (p value = 0.0207) and beta diversities (p value = 0.009) results showed significant differences between the two groups. Overall, indoor cats have greater amounts of Peniophorella, whereas outdoor cats havehigher Trichosporon and unclassified Sordariaceae. The study also suggests thatkeeping a cat indoors or left as a stray will affect their respective gutmycobiome.

AB  - Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a gram-negative rod that is part of the commensalmicrobiota of dogs' and cats' mouths. In this case, we report an 85-year-old man with COVID-19 who had his right arm bitten by a dog. His symptoms were impairedconsciousness, agitation and aggressive behavior. Physical examination revealedneck stiffness and Brudzinski's sign. The cerebrospinal fluid culture wascompatible with Capnocytophaga canimorsus. He required intensive care andreceived a 14-day prescription of meropenem. After 40 days of hospitalization,the patient was fully recovered and was discharged. This case highlights theimportance of physician and microbiologist be awareness of this disease, mainlyin patients with neurological symptoms after a dog or cat bite.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is avirus of zoonotic origin that can bind to ACE2 receptors on the cells of manywild and domestic mammals. Studies have shown that the virus can circulate among animals mutate, lead to animal-to-human zoonotic jump, and further onward spread between humans. Infection in pets is unusual, and there are few human-to-pettransmission reports worldwide. OBJECTIVE: To describe the SARS-CoV-2 infectionin a domestic animal in Cordoba, Colombian Caribbean region. METHODS: Across-sectional molecular surveillance study was carried out, oral and rectalswabs were taken from cats and dogs living with people diagnosed with coronavirusdisease 2019 (COVID-19). RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was found in a cat living with aperson with COVID-19. Genome sequencing showed that the B.1.111 lineage causedthe infection in the cat. The owner's sample could not be sequenced. The lineage is predominant in Colombia, and this variant is characterised by the presence of the D614D and Q57H mutation. CONCLUSION: The present work is the first report of an infected cat with SARS-CoV-2 with whole-genome sequencing in Colombia. Ithighlights the importance of detecting SARS-CoV-2 mutations that could promotethe transmissibility of this new coronavirus. There is still a significantinformation gap on human-to-cat-to-human infection; we encourage self-isolationmeasures between COVID-19 patients and companion animals. The findings of thisstudy give a preliminary view of the current panorama of SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals in Colombia.

TI  - Leptospiral infection: a serosurvey in urban and rural communities in Olavarriacounty, Argentina.
PG  - 608-615
LID - 10.3855/jidc.13154 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Leptospirosis is a neglected zoonotic disease, affecting mainlypoor and vulnerable populations. METHODOLOGY: A cross sectional-study was carriedout in 557 subjects from Olavarria county (Argentina) to estimate theseroprevalence of leptospirosis and the factors associated with seropositivity. Asurvey was carried out to obtain clinical and epidemiological data. Serum wastested for anti-leptospiral antibodies by Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT).Chi-square or Fisher Exact tests were used to assess association between the MAT results and the exploratory variables. For the variables statisticallyassociated, odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) werecalculated. Individuals from Olavarria city were georeferenced to describe thespatial distribution and to detect clusters of seropositivity for leptospiralantibodies. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of leptospirosis infection was 7.00%,higher in rural (19.66%) than in urban populations (3.64%) (p < 0.001). Sejroewas the most predominant serogroup in rural communities while Icterohaemorrhagiaewas the most prevalent in urban populations. The factors associated withLeptospira infection were the presence of rodents inside households (OR = 3.9) inrural populations, while contact with cats (OR = 4.97) and male gender (OR =7.75) represented higher risk of infection for the urban ones. Cases withpositive serology have been found near Tapalque stream or in the peripheral areasof Olavarria city. CONCLUSIONS: The results from data obtained during the studyperiod were similar to other reports and demonstrate the importance of continuousepidemiological surveillance system and specific community educational campaigns to prevent the leptospirosis infection in Olavarria county and other communities with similar characteristics especially in rural areas.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Campylobacteriosis, is a zoonotic bacterial disease observed with arising worldwide. It is becoming the most commonly recognized cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in under-five mortality in recent years. This study was done todetermine the prevalence and determinants of Campylobacter infection amongunder-fives with acute watery diarrhea. METHODS: This institutional-basedcross-sectional study was conducted at governmental and private healthinstitutions in Hawassa city. All outpatient under-five children who met theinclusion criteria from April 2021 to August 2021 were enrolled in this study.Demographic and clinical data were obtained using a standardized data collection tool. Stool samples were collected from each participant with a sterile containerand inoculated on a campylobacter agar media. The isolates were identified byusing biochemical tests and a disc diffusion technique was performed to determinethe antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of the isolates. Data were entered andanalyzed using SPSS version 21. Descriptive and Logistic regression analysis was applied to determine the determinants of Campylobacter infection. P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 235 under-fivechildren were enrolled in this study with a 100% response rate. Of these 130(55.3%) and 105(44.7%) were males and females respectively with the age range of 2 months to 60 months with the mean age of 25 months. The majority of the 150(63.2%) were rural residents. Of 235 under-fives with acute watery diarrhea, 16(6.8%) patients were found to have Campylobacter infection with (95% CI,3.8-10.2%). Consumption of pasteurized milk (AOR: 0.12; 95% CI 0.02-0.75,P<0.05), presence of domestic animals like cats, hens, and cows (AOR: 0.09: 95%CI 0.01-0.67, P<0.05), absence of handwashing practice before food preparation(AOR: 3.63, 95% CI 1.15-11.46, P<0.05) showed significant association withcampylobacter infection. The antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of theisolated bacteria were 100% sensitivity to Azithromycin, Chloramphenicol, andGentamicin, however; it was 100% resistant to Cephalothin. The associations ofsocio-demographic, environmental, and behavioral factors were compared andconsumption of unpasteurized milk, the presence of domestic animal like the catwas significantly associated. CONCLUSION: Campylobacter infection showed acomparatively low prevalence in under-fives with acute watery diarrhea. In thisstudy contact with cats, consumption of unpasteurized milk were associated withCampylobacter infection. The treatment approach of Campylobacter infection mustconsider the sensitivity profile of antibiotics as indicated in the study. We,therefore, recommend further studies to determine the species responsible forCampylobacter infection with other co-morbidities and the susceptibility pattern for each species to indicate appropriate antibiotic therapy.

LID - 10.1111/vop.12993 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the corneal topography and tomography of cats using a dualScheimpflug and Placido disc device. ANIMAL STUDIED: Sixteen mixed-breed cats (32eyes). PROCEDURE(S): Cats were sedated using meperidine (4.3 mg/kg/IM) andxylazine (0.5 mg/kg/IM), and evaluated using the software Galilei. Valuesassessed included anterior and posterior corneal curvature, total corneal power, and corneal thickness. RESULTS: Ten males and six females aged between 18 and 48 months were evaluated. The simulated keratometry (SimK) was 38.37 +/- 0.83D, meanposterior keratometry -4.89 +/- 0.34D, and mean total corneal power 38.04 +/-0.94D. The mean central corneal thickness (CCT) was 617.34 +/- 53.38 mum with amean thinnest point of 583.74 +/- 60.60 mum. CONCLUSION: The Galilei examination was feasible in cats, enabling a detailed study of the cornea. To the best of ourknowledge, this is the first study evaluating the corneal topography andtomography of cats using a device that integrates data from a dual Scheimpflugand Placido disc system.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate feline injection site-associated sarcoma (FISAS) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (FOSCC) cells in 3-D hydrogel-based cell cultures todetermine chemosensitivity to carboplatin at concentrations comparable to thoseeluted from carboplatin-impregnated calcium sulfate hemihydrate (C-ICSH) beads.SAMPLE: 2 immortalized cell lines, each from a histologically confirmed primaryFISAS and FOSCC. PROCEDURES: Hydrogels (10% wt/vol) were formed via UV exposurefrom methacrylamide-functionalized gelatin dissolved in PBSS. For each cell line,approximately 100,000 cells were encapsulated per hydrogel. Three cell-seeded 3-Dhydrogels were evaluated for each carboplatin concentration (0, 150, 300, 450,and 600 microM) across 3 experiments. Drug efficacy was assessed by luminescence assay 72 hours after treatment. Growth of tumor cells treated with 300 microM or 600 microM carboplatin was evaluated using live-cell morphology imaging andconfocal microscopy at 3, 7, and 14 days after treatment. RESULTS: Meanhalf-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values for FISAS and FOSCC cellsranged from 123 to 171 microM and 155 to 190 microM, respectively, based onluminescence assay. Viability at 3, 7, and 14 days for both cell lines at 300microM carboplatin was 50%, 25%, and 5% and at 600 microM carboplatin was 25%,10%, and < 5%. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: 3-D hydrogel cell culture systems supportedgrowth of feline tumor cells for determination of in vitro chemosensitivity.IC50s of each cell line were within the range of carboplatin concentrationseluted from C-ICSH beads. Cells from FISAS and FOSCC cell lines treated withcarboplatin showed dose-dependent and time-dependent decreases in viability.

PG  - e23962
LID - 10.7759/cureus.23962 [doi]
AB  - Pasteurella multocida is a rare but aggressive causative organism inpanophthalmitis. It is commonly transmitted to humans through contact with catsand dogs as a result of bites or scratches. We report a rare case ofpanophthalmitis due to P. multocida following an industrial penetrating injury. Apreviously healthy 40-year-old steel factory operator developed a right eyepenetrating injury after being struck accidentally by a piece of iron wire which flew into his eye during work. He complained of immediate blurring of vision and severe pain in the affected eye. During history taking, he mentioned that manystray cats wandered around his workplace, although he had no direct contact with these animals. On examination, the best-corrected visual acuity was lightperception in the right eye. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy revealed injectedconjunctiva and a full-thickness macerated corneal laceration wound. The anteriorchamber appeared shallow with the presence of lens matter. He was treatedpromptly with surgical repair along with intracameral and intravenous antibioticsfor six hours post-trauma. His eye condition, however, deterioratedpostoperatively despite aggressive treatment with further topical, intravitreal, and systemic antibiotics. This is the first reported case of ocular P. multocida panophthalmitis secondary to industrial penetrating injury. Our case highlightsthe rapidly progressive nature of P. multocida infection. It should always beconsidered due to the very serious nature of infection as well as its resistance to standard antibiotic treatment regimens.

AB  - Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Additives andProducts or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver ascientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of Sunset Yellow FCF for cats,dogs, ornamental fish, grain-eating ornamental birds and small rodents when used as an additive that adds or restores colour in feedingstuffs. Sunset Yellow FCFis considered safe for the target species at the following concentrations incomplete feed: 165 mg/kg for cats, 198 mg/kg for dogs, 733 mg/kg for ornamentalfish, 24 mg/kg for grain-eating ornamental birds and 750 mg/kg for small rodents.In the absence of adequate information, the FEEDAP Panel cannot conclude neither on the eyes and skin irritation potential of Sunset yellow FCF, nor on its skinsensitisation potential. Exposure by inhalation is considered to be unlikely. TheFEEDAP Panel cannot conclude on the efficacy of the additive.

TI  - The ultrasound-guided funicular block in cats undergoing orchiectomy: ropivacaineinjection into the spermatic cord to improve intra and postoperative analgesia.
PG  - 169
LID - 10.1186/s12917-022-03279-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The orchiectomy in cats is a common surgical procedure with mediumlevel of pain and for this reason requires intra and postoperative analgesiamanagement. The aim of this study was to compare intra and postoperative pain in two groups of cats undergoing orchiectomy. Sixty healthy cats were randomlyassigned in two groups (n = 30) to receive pre surgery ropivacaine hydrochloride (0.2 mL/kg at 0.5%) (R Group) or NaCl 0.9% (C group) into the spermatic cord. Theintraoperative evaluation was carried out using the cardiorespiratory stabilityparameters and eventually administration of rescue analgesia. A rescue analgesia (fentanyl 2 microg/kg) was administered during orchiectomy in case ofconsiderable increase of blood pressure, heart rate or respiratory rate. Thepostoperative evaluation was been done using scores following a UNESP-Botucatumultimodal scale for 6 h post-surgery. RESULTS: As result, cats in R groupresponded better to surgical procedure, maintaining lower postoperative painscores than C group. CONCLUSIONS: The ultrasound-guided funicular block used inthis study, as already demonstrated in dogs, is a good method to protect the catsfrom surgical pain and ensure a good level of surgical analgesia.

AB  - The first quantification of neural discharge from the carotid body of cats inresponse to hypoxia, hypercapnic acidosis, and their combination discovered astrong potentiating effect of hypoxia and hypercapnic acidosis combined ascompared to either alone. This paper was the start of a research journey thateventually examined the regulation of blood and cerebrospinal pH by peripheraland central chemoreceptors in the setting of systemic acid-base alterations. Thisresearch focus was the result of the author's personal fascination with mountainsand human adaptation to high altitude-an interest that led to his own ascent ofMount Everest in 1963. The inherent uncertainty and challenge involved withclimbing high mountains has served as a metaphor and inspiration for his life,including his career in academic medicine.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to distribute a survey to cat owners toidentify common clinical signs of feline cognitive dysfunction (FCD) and toevaluate for potential risk factors. METHODS: A questionnaire was developed andadapted based on previously validated canine cognitive dysfunctionquestionnaires. This questionnaire was distributed to 4342 cat owners who hadpresented to Colorado State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital between 2015 and 2020. Cats aged 8 years with signs of cognitive dysfunction and no underlyingmedical conditions were classified as the FCD-positive group. Cats aged 8 yearswith no signs of cognitive dysfunction were classified as the FCD-negativecontrol group. Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were used to determineassociations between categorical variables and a P value <0.05 was consideredindicative of evidence of association. RESULTS: A total of 615 completed surveyresponses were recorded, which was a response rate of 14.2%. Among those, 80(13%) cats were identified as the FCD-positive group and 114 (18.5%) wereidentified as the FCD-negative control group. The most common clinical sign inthe FCD-positive group was inappropriate vocalization (32/80, 40.0%). The onlyvariable determined to have an association with the FCD group (positive ornegative), with a P value of 0.033, was the environmental setting. Cats living ina rural environment (FCD-positive or -negative) had the largest contribution tothe chi(2) statistic. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: The observed number ofFCD-positive cats living in a rural community was less than the expected valuebased on the chi(2) tests. This is suggestive of an association between living ina rural environment and a reduced chance of cognitive dysfunction. There are manyfactors such as air pollution, social interactions and environmental enrichmentthat need to be studied further to determine how they relate to FCD as this couldnot be concluded from this study.

PG  - e116-e123
LID - 10.1177/1098612X221094947 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this multicentre retrospective study was to describe theclinical presentation, imaging findings, diagnosis and outcomes of cats withretrobulbar neoplasia. METHODS: A total of 37 cats that were diagnosed withretrobulbar neoplasia and underwent advanced imaging were recruited from searchesof the clinical records of two referral hospitals. All cats had neoplasiaconfirmed via cytology or histopathology. Data relating to the signalment,presentation, results of investigations, treatment and outcome were recorded. Areview of imaging studies was performed where possible. RESULTS: In total, 23cases (62%) were presented with respiratory signs. Exophthalmos was the mostcommon ophthalmological examination finding, present in 18 cases (49%).Thirty-two cases (86%) had secondary extension of neoplasia to the retrobulbarspace (most commonly from the nasal cavities), present in 20 cases (54%), ofwhich 12 were lymphoma. In cases where contrast was administered, 28/35 (80%) hadcontrast-enhancing masses. Orbital extension was detected in 21 cases (57%),exophthalmos in 22 (59%), globe deformation in 12 (32%) and locallymphadenomegaly in 22 (61%). In total, 36 (97%) retrobulbar tumours weremalignant. Thoracic imaging, where it was performed, was concerning formetastasis in 8/25 cases (31%), with abdominal imaging suggestive of metastasisin 5/12 (42%). The most common diagnosis was lymphoma with 19 cases (51%), withnasal lymphoma representing 12 of these, followed by carcinoma in 10 (27%). Themedian survival time, for cases where death was recorded, was 85 days (range1-263 days). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: To the authors' knowledge, this is thelargest study of neoplasia affecting the feline retrobulbar space. Retrobulbartumours in cats are overwhelmingly malignant, and commonly due to secondaryextension of tumours originating elsewhere. Lymphoma, particularly arising fromthe nasal cavities, was the most common cause. Cats presenting with signssuggestive of retrobulbar disease should be assessed for disease affecting any ofthe structures of the head.

TI  - Does Opisthorchis viverrini circulate between humans and domestic cats in anendemic area in Thailand?
PG  - 1-5
LID - 10.1017/S0031182022000646 [doi]
AB  - The liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini is a foodborne trematode that, in chronic infection, is a leading cause of bile-duct cancer - cholangiocarcinoma. Cats and dogs are acknowledged as reservoir hosts of this parasite. However, thisassumption is based on morphological similarity of flukes recovered from thesehosts, without any molecular genetic evidence. The aim of this study was toobtain molecular data from O. viverrini eggs present in feces of humans and cats in the same locality in Thanya sub-district, Kalasin, Thailand. The mitochondrialcytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene was used as the marker for apopulation-genetic study. A DNA fragment of the cox1 gene was amplified fromstool samples and subjected to nucleotide sequencing. Phylogenetic and haplotype network analyses were performed. The cox1 sequences of O. viverrini eggs fromhumans and cats largely formed separate clades on the phylogenetic trees, with anFst value of 0.64 (P < 0.05), indicating largely distinct populations in the 2species. However, 5 samples from cats were placed in the human cluster and 1sample from a human was placed in the cat cluster. This suggests that hostspecificity of 'human' and 'cat' clades is not absolute. These results indicatethat there are 2 populations of O. viverrini, one circulates primarily in humans and the other in cats. However, cross-transmission can occur between these 2hosts. Taken altogether, the population-genetic evidence from this studypartially supports the assumption that the cat can act as a reservoir host of O. viverrini.

TI  - Dipylidium caninum in the twenty-first century: epidemiological studies andreported cases in companion animals and humans.
PG  - 131
LID - 10.1186/s13071-022-05243-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dipilidiosis is a parasitic disease caused by the tapeworm Dipylidiumcaninum. Fleas and, less frequently, lice act as an intermediate host, and their ingestion is required for infection to occur. While the disease mainly affectsdomestic and wild carnivores, it is also considered a zoonotic disease, with mosthuman cases reported in children. Dipylidium caninum is considered to be the mostcommon tapeworm infesting companion animals, but dipilidosis in humans is rare.The aims of this review were to improve current understanding of the epidemiologyof this parasitosis and its management by the medical and veterinary community.METHODS: A comprehensive review of the published literature during the last 21years (2000-2021) on the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, treatmentand prevention measures of D. caninum infection and dipilidiosis in companionanimals and humans was conducted. RESULTS: Using predefined eligibility criteria for a search of the published literature, we retrieved and screened 280publications. Of these, 161 (141 epidemiological studies, 20 case reports [16human cases]) were considered for inclusion in this review. This parasitosis ispresent worldwide; however, despite being the most frequent cestode infection in animals, it is often underdiagnosed using common coprological techniques. Itsdiagnosis in humans has also proved challenging, being frequently confused withpinworm infection, leading to inappropriate treatment and to the persistence ofthe disease over time. Prevention measures include control of ectoparasites inanimals and the environment, as well as regular deworming of animals, mostcommonly with praziquantel. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of dipilidiosis remainschallenging in both animals and humans, primarily due to the low sensitivity ofthe diagnostic methods currently available and a lack of knowledge of themorphological characteristics of the parasite. Although treatment with theappropriate anti-cestode compounds is well tolerated and results in resolution ofthe infection, indiscriminate use of these compounds may predispose to anincrease in resistance. Given the worldwide distribution of this parasite, it is essential to act on several fronts, with a focus on health education for childrenand animal owners and the control of intermediate hosts, both in animals and inthe surrounding environment.

TI  - Leishmania tropica and Leishmania infantum infection in dogs and cats in central Israel.
PG  - 147
LID - 10.1186/s13071-022-05272-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Three species of Leishmania cause disease in humans in Israel and areendemic in the Middle East: Leishmania infantum, Leishmania tropica andLeishmania major. These species infect dogs and cats, but little is known abouttheir prevalence in pet populations and their clinical manifestations. A study ondog and cat Leishmania infection was conducted in a focus of human L. tropicainfection in central Israel with the aim of getting insight on leishmaniosis inpets in an area where human infection is highly prevalent. METHODS: Blood,demographic and clinical data were collected from dogs and cats brought forveterinary care in a focus of human L. tropica infection during 2018-2020. kDNAPCR and internal transcribed spacer1 high-resolution melt analysis PCR (ITS1 HRM PCR) with DNA sequencing were performed for the detection of Leishmania andspecies determination. RESULTS: Forty-three of 189 dogs (22.8%) and 44 of 152cats (28.9%) were positive for Leishmania spp. infection by kDNA PCR. The ITS1HRM PCR detected six dogs (3.3%) infected with L. infantum and one (0.5%) with L.tropica, whereas six cats (3.9%) were found infected by L. infantum and five(3.3%) by L. tropica. Four of the five L. tropica-positive cats suffered fromweight loss, four had azotemia, two with mild and two with severe azotemia andprogressive renal disease. Three cats had gingivostomatitis; three had skinlesions with abscess and ulcers in two and scales and hair loss in another cat,which was also FIV +. This is the first report of feline L. tropica infection in Israel. Clinical information on cats with this infection from previous studieselsewhere is scarce. CONCLUSIONS: A high rate of Leishmania spp. infection,mostly estimated as sub-clinical, was found in dogs and cats admitted forveterinary care in an L. tropica focus. Among the animals in which infectioncould be characterized to the species level, more dogs were infected with L.infantum than with L. tropica while 5 of 11 cats were infected with L. tropicaand had signs of systemic and skin disease not described before in feline L.tropica infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Feline leishmaniosis caused by Leishmania infantum is oftenassociated with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection; however, the role and clinical significance of this coinfection remain unknown. This study aimed toassess whether FIV is associated with L. infantum infection in cats from canineleishmaniosis endemic areas and to report the clinical signs and hematologicalalterations associated with coinfection. METHODS: A retrospective matchedcase-control study (ratio 1:2) was conducted. Data of clinical examination andcomplete blood count (CBC) were selected from a cohort of 705 cats examined forepidemiological studies on feline leishmaniosis conducted between 2012 and 2019. Ninety-one FIV seropositive cases and 182 FIV seronegative control cats wereselected. Matching was done according to age, sex, lifestyle and geographicprovenience of case cats. Rapid ELISA devices were mainly used to detect anti-FIVantibodies. Anti-Leishmania IgG antibodies were detected byindirect-immunofluorescence test (IFAT). Leishmania DNA was searched in blood,oral and conjunctival swabs by quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: Felineimmunodeficiency virus seropositive cats had no hematological abnormalitiessuggestive of an advanced stage of FIV infection and were statistically morefrequently IFAT positive, and their risk of being L. infantum antibody positivewas 2.8 greater than in the FIV seronegatives. The association of FIVseropositivity with L. infantum antibody positivity was confirmed in theunivariable model of logistic regression. A multivariate model found FIVinfection and L. infantum PCR positivity as predictors of a positive L. infantum IFAT result. Male outdoor cats from rural or suburban areas were at risk for FIV and L. infantum antibody positivity. Clinical signs more frequently associatedwith the coinfection were oral lesions, pale mucous membranes and low bodycondition score (BCS). CONCLUSIONS: This study documents that FIV seropositivecats with no hematological abnormalities suggestive of an advanced stage of FIVinfection are more prone to be L. infantum seroreactive by IFAT in endemic areas.Therefore, FIV seropositive cats should be tested for L. infantum antibodies and treated for preventing sand fly bites. Pale mucous membranes, low BCS and orallesions but no CBC abnormalities were significantly associated with thecoinfection.

PG  - 102
LID - 10.1186/s13071-022-05223-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Relapsing fever borreliosis is an infectious disease caused bybacteria of the genus Borrelia, inflicting recurrent episodes of fever andspirochetemia in humans. Borrelia persica, the causative agent of relapsing feverin Israel, is prevalent over a broad geographic area that extends from India toEgypt. It is transmitted by the soft tick Ornithodoros tholozani and causesdisease in humans as well as domestic cats and dogs. The goal of this study wasto survey domestic dogs and cats in Israel for infection with B. persica.METHODS: Blood, sera and demographic and clinical data were collected from dogsand cats brought for veterinary care in central Israel. PCR followed by DNAsequencing was used to detect B. persica DNA in blood samples, and anenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect antibodies reactive with B. persica antigens in sera from the same animals. This is the firstserological survey of B. persica in dogs and the first survey for antibodiesreactive with a relapsing fever Borrelia sp. in cats globally. RESULTS: Four ofthe 208 dogs (1.9%) and three of 103 cats (2.9%) sampled were positive by PCR forB. persica DNA, and 24 dogs (11.5%) and 18 cats (17.5%) were seropositive for B. persica antigen by ELISA. The ratio between PCR-positivity and seropositivity in both the dog and cat populations was 1:6. All four PCR-positive dogs and two ofthree PCR-positive cats were seronegative, suggesting a probable recentinfection. Thrombocytopenia showed significant association with seropositivity indogs (P = 0.003). In cats, anemia had a significant association withseropositivity (P = 0.0001), and thrombocytopenia was associated with thecombined prevalence of seropositivity or PCR-positivity (P = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS:Borrelia persica infection is more prevalent and widespread in domestic canineand feline populations in Israel than previously thought. Dogs and cats may play a role as reservoirs and sentinels for human infection. Precautions should betaken to prevent transfusion-transmitted infection between blood donor andrecipient animals.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify FN1 transcripts associated with osteoarthritis (OA)pathophysiology and investigate the downstream effects of modulating FN1expression and relative transcript ratio. METHODS: FN1 transcriptomic data wasobtained from our previously assessed RNA-seq dataset of lesioned and preservedOA cartilage samples (RAAK study). Differential transcript expression analysiswas performed on all 27 FN1 transcripts annotated in Ensembl database. Humanprimary chondrocytes were transduced with lentiviral particles containing shRNAtargeting full length FN1 transcripts or non-targeting shRNA. Subsequently,matrix deposition was induced in our 3D in vitro neo-cartilage model. Effects of changes in FN1 transcript ratio on sulphated glycosaminoglycan deposition wereinvestigated by Alcian blue staining and dimethylmethylene blue assay. Moreover, gene expression levels of 17 cartilage relevant markers were determined byRT-qPCR. RESULTS: We identified 16 FN1 transcripts differentially expressedbetween lesioned and preserved cartilage. FN1-208, encoding Migration-StimulatingFactor, was the most significantly differentially expressed protein codingtranscript. Downregulation of full length FN1 and concomitant increased FN1-208ratio resulted in decreased sulphated glycosaminoglycan deposition, as well asdecreased ACAN and COL2A1 and increased ADAMTS-5, ITGB1, and ITGB5 geneexpression levels. CONCLUSION: We show that full length FN1 downregulation andconcomitant relative FN1-208 upregulation was unbeneficial for deposition ofcartilage matrix, likely due to decreased availability of the classical RGDintegrin-binding site of fibronectin.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare the analgesic effect between carprofenand grapiprant every 12 or 24 h on postoperative pain in cats undergoingovariohysterectomy, in addition to the effects on the hematological, biochemical and urinalysis variables. METHODS: A total of 32 female cats were randomlydivided into three groups, according to the treatment administered with the firstdose given orally 90 mins before surgery, as follows: CAR (cats received 4 mg/kg carprofen, n = 11); GRA1 (cats received 2 mg/kg grapiprant, n = 10); and GRA2(cats received 2 mg/kg grapiprant q12h, n = 11). Pain was assessed byUNESP-Botucatu Multidimensional Composite Pain Scale (UNESP) and Glasgow FelineComposite Measure Pain Scale (GLASGOW) for cats preoperatively (baseline) and at 1, 3, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h after extubation. Venous blood was collected at baseline,and 12 and 24 h after the administration of carprofen or grapiprant to perform a complete blood count (CBC), the percentage of Heinz bodies and serum biochemistry(alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase,gamma-glutamyltransferase, creatinine and urea). Urinalysis was performed atbaseline and 24 h after extubation. Glucose levels were evaluated at baseline and1 h postoperatively. RESULTS: Pain scores were not significantly different among groups in both scales, although pain was higher at 3 h in comparison with 24 h inall groups. In the GRA1 and GRA2 groups, 67% (14/21) of cats needed rescueanalgesia compared with 18% (2/11) in the CAR group. Glucose increased frombaseline to 1 h in the GRA1 and GRA2 groups. None of the CBC, serum biochemistry and urinalysis variables differed among groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:Grapiprant did not promote adequate analgesia during the first 3 hpostoperatively in cats undergoing ovariohysterectomy compared with carprofen,and no benefits were observed by administering grapiprant every 12 h.

LID - 10.5187/jast.2022.e8 [doi]
AB  - As the number of households that raise dogs and cats is increasing, there isgrowing interest in animal health. The gut plays an important role in animalhealth. In particular, the microbiome in the gut is known to affect both theabsorption and metabolism of nutrients and the protective functions of the host. Using probiotics on pets has beneficial effects, such as modulating the immunesystem, helping to reduce stress, protecting against pathogenic bacteria anddeveloping growth performance. The goals of this review are to summarize therelationship between probiotics/the gut microbiome and animal health, to feature technology used for identifying the diversity of microbiota composition of canineand feline microbiota, and to discuss recent reports on probiotics in canines andfelines and the safety issues associated with probiotics and the gut microbiomein companion animals.

AB  - Visual hallucinations are visual perceptions that are not associated with a real object. Visual hallucinations are often associated with dementia, eye disease,visual pathway disease, psychiatric disorders, delirium, migraines, ictalphenomena, or medication effects. We report a case of a 74-year-old woman with a previous cerebrovascular accident(CVA) without residual deficit and no previouspsychiatric history presenting for one week of worsening hallucinationsprogressing from shapes to cats to human figures in the left visual field. Shehad no focal neurologic deficits nor visual field defects detected on physicalexam. CT head without intravenous(IV) contrast demonstrated a nonspecifichypodensity in the right parieto-occipital region. MRI brain with and without IV contrast confirmed an acute stroke. Patient was admitted for risk factormodification and secondary prevention. She continues to have infrequenthallucinations of floating hands and fingers at follow-up appointment 2 weeksafter the initial presentation to the Emergency Department. Posterior circulationCVAs can present with subtle or unusual symptoms. CVA should be included in thedifferential for new onset hallucinations, particularly in elderly patients.

TI  - Successful treatment of feline hyperadrenocorticism with pituitary macroadenomausing radiation therapy: a case study.
PG  - 898-904
LID - 10.1292/jvms.22-0021 [doi]
AB  - A 10-year-old castrated male cat showing behavioral (irritation, prowling, andtumbling) and cutaneous abnormalities such as dermal fragility was diagnosed ashyperadrenocorticism with pituitary macroadenoma, concurrent with insulindependent diabetes mellitus. Pituitary enlargement (18.0 mm) was observed during magnetic resonance imaging. High endogenous adrenocorticotropic hormone levels(>2,500 pg/ml) were also observed. Although trilostane treatment (5-10 mg/head,daily) was commenced, the clinical signs did not disappear. Insulin andtrilostane treatment were discontinued on day 86 after first day of radiationtherapy (4 Gy/12 fractions). After radiation therapy, a decreased pituitary tumorsize (10.7 mm) was observed on day 301; neurological and dermatological signsexhibited remission. Radiation therapy is the treatment of choice for felinehyperadrenocorticism with pituitary macroadenoma with neurological signs.

TI  - Intravenous iron sucrose is safe but does not prevent development of anemia oriron deficiency in healthy cats undergoing serial venipuncture.
LID - 10.2460/ajvr.21.11.0186 [doi]
LID - ajvr.21.11.0186 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate IV iron sucrose safety and impact on hematologic and iron indices in healthy cats. ANIMALS: 5 healthy research cats. PROCEDURES: Cats were administered iron sucrose (0.5 mg/kg, IV) over 30 minutes. Monitoring for acutereactions (temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure) wasperformed every 5 minutes during injection and every 15 minutes for an additionalhour. Baseline, 24-hour, and 1-, 2-, and 3-week postinjection measurements of CBCwith reticulocyte indices, iron panel (ferritin, total iron-binding capacity, andiron), calculated transferrin saturation (TSAT), and serum amyloid A (SAA)concentration were performed. RESULTS: No cat experienced an acute drug reaction.SAA concentration was increased at 24 hours versus baseline. TSAT and ferritindecreased over time, with 3 cats developing concurrent functional iron deficiency(FID) and anemia. Hct (Spearman correlation [rs] = 0.805), hemoglobin (rs =0.770), and reticulocyte hemoglobin content (rs = 0.581) correlated with TSAT.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: IV iron sucrose was well tolerated in healthy cats but wasassociated with transient increase in the systemic inflammatory marker SAA.Efficacy evaluation of dose based on iron deficit is needed in sick cats. Despitecumulative blood draw volume below recommended limits, anemia and FID wereobserved, which has important implications for experimental designs and serialhematologic monitoring. Further evaluation of inflammatory response to IV ironsucrose administration is warranted.

LID - 10.2460/ajvr.21.11.0183 [doi]
LID - ajvr.21.11.0183 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the thermoregulatory and analgesic effects of high-dosebuprenorphine versus morphine in cats undergoing ovariohysterectomy. ANIMALS: 94 client-owned cats. PROCEDURES: Cats were randomized to receive eitherbuprenorphine 0.24 mg/kg or morphine 0.1 mg/kg subcutaneously (SC) duringrecovery from ovariohysterectomy. Body temperature measurements were obtainedbefore anesthesia, during anesthesia (averaged), at extubation, and 2, 4, and 16 to 20 hours postoperatively. Signs of pain were assessed, and demographiccharacteristics were compared between groups. The effects of treatment and timeon body temperature, point prevalence of hyperthermia (> 39.2 degrees C), andpain scores were compared with linear or generalized mixed-effect models.RESULTS: Cats receiving morphine (vs. buprenorphine) were older and heavier(both, P </= 0.005). Other group characteristics did not differ betweentreatments. Cats receiving buprenorphine (vs. morphine) had higher postoperative temperatures (P = 0.03). At 2, 4, and 16 to 20 hours after extubation, the point prevalence of hyperthermia was greater (P = 0.001) for cats receivingbuprenorphine (55% [26/47], 44% [21/47], and 62% [27/43], respectively) versusmorphine (28% [13/46], 13% [6/46], and 47% [21/44], respectively). There were no differences in pain scores between groups or over time. Five cats receivingbuprenorphine and 6 receiving morphine required rescue analgesia within the24-hour period. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Administration of buprenorphine (0.24 mg/kgSC), compared with morphine (0.1 mg/kg SC), resulted in higher body temperatures without an apparent advantage with regard to analgesia during the first 20postoperative hours than morphine. Opioid-induced postoperative hyperthermiacould confound the diagnosis of fever from different sources.

LID - 10.2460/ajvr.21.09.0152 [doi]
LID - ajvr.21.09.0152 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the in vitro effects of the proteasome inhibitorbortezomib in feline injection site sarcoma (FISS) cell lines. SAMPLE: In vitrocultures of the FISS cell lines Ela-1, Hamilton, and Kaiser. PROCEDURES: Cellswere treated with increasing doses of bortezomib or vehicle alone (dimethylsulfoxide) and evaluated for cell viability via an adenosine triphosphateconcentration assay, proteasome activity via a commercially available proteasome assay, accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins via Western blot, and apoptosis viaflow cytometry. RESULTS: All 3 cell lines were sensitive to bortezomib with a 50%inhibitory concentration after 48 hours of treatment at 17.46 nM (95% CI, 15.47to 19.72 nM) for Ela-1, 19.48 nM (95% CI, 16.52 to 23.00 nM) for Hamilton, and21.38 nM (95% CI, 19.24 to 23.78 nM) for Kaiser. In the Ela-1 cell line, 20 nMbortezomib inhibited 20S proteasome activity by 90.9% compared with thevehicle-only control. In the Kaiser cell line, 20 nM bortezomib decreased 20Sproteasome activity by 70%, compared with the untreated vehicle-only control.Last, treatment with bortezomib (25 and 40 nM) resulted in statisticallysignificant decreases in viable cells accompanied by a statistically significant increase in apoptotic cells. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Treatment options for FISS,especially nonresectable FISS, are currently very limited. These results support further investigation of bortezomib either alone or in combination with othertreatments in such cases.

AB  - Aging is the single most important cause of disease, disability, and death incompanion animal species. Contrary to the common view of aging as mysterious and inevitable, it is more usefully understood as a set of complex but comprehensibleand modifiable biological processes that are highly conserved across species. Thepurpose of this Currents in One Health manuscript is to describe key mechanismsof aging at the cellular and molecular level and the manifestations of these inthe tissues of the musculoskeletal system, adipose, and the brain. Thecharacteristics of these processes as identified in common laboratory animalmodels and in humans will be described and compared with the much more limitedinformation available concerning aging in dogs and cats. This will highlightimportant targets for future research in these species. The consistent patternsacross species in the hallmarks of aging and their manifestations at the level oftissues, organ systems, and individual animals signify potential targets forinterventions to mitigate the negative health impacts of aging and extend bothlife span and health span (the period of life free of significant disease ordisability). Further research to elucidate aging mechanisms in companion dogs andcats will eventually support development, testing, and implementation of clinicaltherapies to prevent and ameliorate age-related dysfunction, disease, and death.

AB  - Tumors originating from eccrine glands are rare findings in dogs and cats. Inmost cases, the tumors are malignant, while adenomas are only reportedanecdotally. In the present case, a one-year-old female, spayed cat was presentedwith a swelling of the footpad of the right forelimb. Initially, the masspossessed a diameter of 2 cm which progressed to 4 cm within the following twomonths. At the latter time point the tumor was ulcerated. After surgical removal,histological and immunohistochemical analyses were performed. Histologically, awell demarcated, nodular, multilobular mass was present. The cuboidal to columnarneoplastic cells were arranged in tubular and acinar structures. Tumor cellspossessed large, round to oval nuclei with moderately distinct nucleoli. Mitotic figures averaged 0-1 per high power field. Additionally, large areas of chondroidmetaplasia were evident. Immunohistochemically, neoplastic cells were positivefor pan-cytokeratin AE1/AE3 whereas thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1) was notexpressed. Based on the histological and immunohistochemical findings an adenoma of the eccrine glands was diagnosed.

PG  - 102-111
LID - 10.1055/a-1795-8078 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was aimed to assess the distribution and frequency ofuroliths in cats as well as to evaluate gender-, age-, and breed-specificdifferences. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 3629 uroliths from cats in Germany wereanalyzed by infrared-spectroscopy during the period 2016-2020. The majority(3300) of the uroliths originated from purebred cats of 22 breeds. RESULTS:Uroliths were prevalent in the order of male neutered (45.3 %), female spayed(35.3 %), male intact (7.4 %), and female intact cats (6.3 %). Median age of the cats with uroliths was 7 years, although it varied slightly depending on types ofthe urolith. The most frequent uroliths were calcium oxalate (59.5 %), followedby struvite (33.7 %), ammonium urate (2 %), calcium phosphate (1.7 %), cystine(0.7 %) and xanthine (0.4 %). Males (59.4 %) and females (59.2 %) showed nearlyidentical prevalence of calcium oxalates, whereas it significantly diverged incastrated (60.2 %) versus intact animals (54.4 %; p = 0.01). With regard tostruvites, male cats (32.6 %) were less prone than females (35.4 %; p = 0.08)while intact cats (38.2 %) significantly outnumbered the castrated cohorts (33.1 %; p = 0.02). The prevalence for calcium oxalate uroliths increased by 6.6 %during the study period, contrasting a decrease of 5.5 % for struvites. Somebreeds (> 10 individuals) showed significantly higher propensities than othersfor urolith formation. Calcium oxalates were significantly more frequent inBritish shorthair cats (85.2 %), Ragdoll (75 %), Scottish fold (74.1 %) andPersians (72.4 %). Struvites were prevailing in Norwegian forest cats (48.5 %),British longhair (41.7 %), European shorthair (41.7 %) and Siberian forest cats(36.8 %). Siamese cats had the significantly highest percentage of cystineuroliths (16 %). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The occurrence of urinecalculi in cats from Germany was found to be most frequent for calcium oxalateand struvite types. We also found breed-, age-, gender- specific differences inaddition to variations depending on the neutering status of the animals.

TI  - Utility of a canine TSH assay for diagnosis and monitoring of felinehyperthyroidism.
PG  - 93-100
LID - 10.1055/a-1807-9546 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This retrospective study was initiated to evaluate the utility of TSH measurements using a common canine TSH assay to diagnose and monitor felinehyperthyroidism after radioiodine or thyreostatic drug treatment. MATERIAL ANDMETHODS: The electronic database of the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna was searched for combined TSH and T4 measurements. 217 pairs of TSH and T4 from136 cats with possible hyperthyroidism were assigned to group A (untreated; n =24) and B (treated; n = 193). Measurements in group B were then subcategorizedaccording to T4 concentrations (reference range 15-50 nmol/L): group B1 =elevated T4 (n = 46), group B2 = normal T4 (n = 84) and group B3 = decreased T4(n = 63). Group B2 was further divided into cats with low normal (group B2a; n = 35), medium normal (group B2b; n = 29) and high normal (group B2c; n = 20) T4concentrations. RESULTS: TSH was detectable in 4 (17 %) of the 24 untreated cats (group A) and did not return to normal despite seemingly successful therapy intwo. Increased TSH concentrations were observed in 3.6 % of the treated cats ingroup B2 and 2.9 %, 6.9 %, and 0 % in subgroups B2a, B2b and B2c, respectively.Forty-four percent of the treated cats with a decreased T4 (group B3) had anincreased TSH concentration. TSH correlated with treatment length (r = 0.358, p =0.004) and was significantly higher in cats treated for more than 3 months (p =0.008). CONCLUSION: TSH was detectable in a significant number of untreatedhyperthyroid cats and thus this parameter should not be used to definitively ruleout feline hyperthyroidism. Furthermore, the very low prevalence of increased TSHconcentrations in treated hyperthyroid cats with a normal T4 and cost benefitcalculations do not support the routine measurement of TSH in these cats. Thefact that TSH correlated with time since treatment start and 56 % of the catswith a decreased T4 had TSH concentrations within the reference limits, suggests delayed recovery of the pituitary thyrotrophs which might explain the lowprevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism in the present study. CLINICALRELEVANCE: TSH measurement in cats with suspected or treated hyperthyroidismusing a canine assay lacks diagnostic sensitivity and can only complementtherapeutic decision-making.

PG  - 82-91
LID - 10.1055/a-1789-2762 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Only a few ophthalmologics specifically approved for cats areavailable on the market leading to frequent use of drugs approved for humans. In Germany, the administration, dispense or prescription of pharmaceuticals isregulated by the pharmaceuticals law ('Arzneimittelgesetz' (AMG)) as well as the regulation concerning pharmacies in veterinary practice ('Verordnung ubertierarztliche Hausapotheken' (TAHAV)). The aim of this study was to collect data concerning the occurrence and frequency of feline eye diseases and to evaluatethe frequency of the necessity for extra-label drug use. Evidence-based, optimal treatment schemes were generated and reviewed with regard to their feasibility inGermany. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data from 876 cats with ocular problems of the"Small Animal Clinic", Freie Universitat Berlin as well as a small animalpractice in Southern Germany were evaluated (01.01.2015-31.12.2018).Subsequently, the theoretical accessibility for approved agents and/orextra-label drug use in Germany was analyzed. RESULTS: 1198 diagnoses were based on 925 ophthalmic examinations. The most common diseases include conjunctivitis, keratitis, uveitis, hypertensive retinopathy and glaucoma. 885/1198 (73.9 %) ofthese diseases required treatment, which equates to 722/925 (78.1 %) cases. Forall patients, treatment would have been possible according to evidence-baseddata. In 225/722 (31.2 %) cases, treatment with the pertaining, specificallyapproved agents would have been possible. Extra-label drug use would have beennecessary in 497/722 cases (68.8 %). Of the 497 cases necessitating extra-labeluse, pharmaceuticals approved for humans would have been available for 481 cases (96.8 %), extra-label use of other veterinary pharmaceuticals would have beenpossible in 28 cases (5.6 %) and in 60 cases (12.2 %) especially manufactureddrugs could have been employed. In a total of 36/722 cases (5 %), optimal carewould not have been possible in the context of the current regulatory framework. CONCLUSION: Based on regulations concerning therapeutic necessity, theophthalmologic therapy of cats in Germany is possible within the regulatoryframework. In the present study, 5 % of the patients could not receive optimalmedical care. The closure of this gap demands additional approval of veterinaryophthalmic drugs as well as the research and development of novel active agentsand veterinary pharmaceuticals.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide epidemiological information on animal and human cases ofrabies in the US during 2020 and summaries of 2020 rabies surveillance for Canadaand Mexico. ANIMALS: All animals submitted for laboratory diagnosis of rabies in the US during 2020. PROCEDURES: State and territorial public health departmentsand USDA Wildlife Services provided 2020 rabies surveillance data. Data wereanalyzed temporally and geographically to assess trends in domestic and wildlife rabies cases. RESULTS: During 2020, 54 jurisdictions submitted 87,895 animalsamples for rabies testing, of which 85,483 (97.3%) had a conclusive (positive ornegative) test result. Of these, 4,479 (5.2%) tested positive for rabies,representing a 4.5% decrease from the 4,690 cases reported in 2019. Texas (n =580 [12.9%]), Pennsylvania (371 [8.3%]), Virginia (351 [7.8%]), New York (346[7.7%]), North Carolina (301 [6.7%]), New Jersey (257 [5.7%]), Maryland (256[5.7%]), and California (248 [5.5%]) together accounted for > 60% of all animalrabies cases reported in 2020. Of the total reported rabid animals, 4,090 (91.3%)involved wildlife, with raccoons (n = 1,403 [31.3%]), bats (1,400 [31.3%]),skunks (846 [18.9%]), and foxes (338 [7.5%]) representing the primary hostsconfirmed with rabies. Rabid cats (288 [6.4%]), cattle (43 [1.0%]), and dogs (37 [0.8%]) accounted for 95% of rabies cases involving domestic animals in 2020. No human rabies cases were reported in 2020. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Forthe first time since 2006, the number of samples submitted for rabies testing in the US was < 90,000; this is thought to be due to factors related to the COVID-19pandemic, as similar decreases in sample submission were also reported by Canada and Mexico.

LID - 10.1111/vec.13209 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and clinicopathological characteristics,treatment, and outcome for dogs and cats with a confirmed foxtail. DESIGN:Retrospective study utilizing a medical records database over a 10-year periodfrom January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2018. SETTING: University teaching hospital.ANIMALS: Seven hundred and fifty-four dogs and 37 cats with a diagnosis offoxtail foreign body. Cases with direct visualization by a clinician or onhistopathology were included. Information extracted for each case includedsignalment; anatomical foxtail location; clinicopathological and imagingfindings; treatments and interventions provided; and outcome. MEASUREMENTS ANDMAIN RESULTS: The prevalence of foxtail associated disease was 0.25% in dogs and 0.07% in cats over this time period. Most animals were young to middle-aged andpresented in the summer months. The most common location in dogs was the auralcanal, cutaneous/subcutaneous space, and nasal canal. In cats, ocular foxtailswere most common (30/37). Blood work changes were nonspecific. Ultrasoundsupervised by a boarded radiologist was utilized in 114 cases, mainly forsubcutaneous, sublumbar, and intracavitary foxtail locations, with successfullocation of a foxtail in 72.8% of cases scanned. Computed tomography wasperformed in 78 dogs with suspected intracavitary foxtail migration, and in allcases, structural changes related to the presence of the foxtail were found.Anerobic bacteria were most commonly isolated when a culture was submitted, with Actinomyces spp. rarely isolated. The most common of the 120 anaerobic isolateswere Bacteroides/Prevotella spp. (n = 38), Fusobacterium spp. (n = 32), andPeptostreptococcus anaerobius (n = 30). CONCLUSIONS: The short-term outcome forfoxtail-associated lesions is good, and most cases can be managed on anoutpatient basis. A minority of cases develop life-threatening disease and mayrequire a multidisciplinary approach of multimodal imaging, endoscopy, orsurgery.

LID - 10.1111/jsap.13508 [doi]
AB  - Cholangitis/cholangiohepatitis complex in cats is commonly encountered inclinical practice worldwide. Diagnosis and management of cats with this complexis difficult because of the ambiguity of clinical signs, diagnostic test results and commonality of comorbid disorders. These impediments can delay diseaseidentification and treatment, which can increase morbidity and mortality. In thisnarrative review, we aimed to provide a thorough review of the uniquephysioanatomic features of the biliary system as well as clinically relevantupdates on cholangitis/cholangiohepatitis complex in cats.

PG  - 5112274
LID - 10.1155/2022/5112274 [doi]
AB  - Traumatic vertebral fracture or luxation often results in spinal instabilityrequiring surgical stabilization. This study describes the long-term outcome ofspinal stabilization using a unilateral 5-hole 2-0 UniLock implant in eight dogs and two cats with trauma-induced thoracolumbar vertebral luxation/subluxation andpresumed instability, as assessed by a combination of preoperative radiographsand MRI using a 3-compartment method. The UniLock plate was secured with fourmonocortical locking screws in adjacent vertebral bodies. Additional pins andfacet screws were used in several patients. Postoperative radiographs and MRIstudies showed restoration of the main spinal axis in all patients andsatisfactory implantation of the screws in the vertebral bodies, with nointrusion in the vertebral canal or in the adjacent intervertebral disc spaces.Neurological status improved in nine patients six weeks postoperatively. Partial implant failure was detected in three patients with no long-term consequences.After 12 months, seven patients reached full recovery with no neurologicaldeficit, two patients were euthanized (including one owing to an unrelatedcondition), and one remained paraparetic. The results of this study demonstratethat using a 2-0 UniLock implant to stabilize the thoracolumbar spine results in satisfactory long-term recovery in most dogs and cats with traumatic spinalluxation/subluxation and presumed instability. Complications may occur but do notrequire revision surgery and do not affect clinical outcomes.

AB  - Pulmonary thromboembolism is a potentially life threatening condition that isuncommonly recognized in cats. Thrombolytic agents have been described as atreatment for this condition in human and canine patients, particularly in cases where hemodynamic instability is persistent despite supportive care. This report describes the clinical course, echocardiographic diagnosis, and successfulthrombolysis of a cat with pulmonary thromboembolism. Despite confirmedreperfusion, the cat succumbed to thromboembolic disease highlighting the dearth of knowledge about optimal treatment of this disease process in small animals,particularly in cats.

TI  - First report demonstrating the presence of Toxocara spp. eggs on vegetables grownin community gardens in Europe.
PG  - e00158
LID - 10.1016/j.fawpar.2022.e00158 [doi]
AB  - Toxocara canis and T. cati are zoonotic roundworm parasites of dogs, cats andfoxes. These definitive hosts pass eggs in their faeces, which contaminate theenvironment and can subsequently be ingested via soil or contaminated vegetables.In humans, infection with Toxocara can have serious health implications. Thisproof-of-concept study aimed to investigate the presence of Toxocara spp. eggs on'ready-to-eat' vegetables (lettuce, spinach, spring onion and celery) sampledfrom community gardens in southern England. The contamination of vegetables with Toxocara eggs has never been investigated in the UK before, and more widely, thisis the first time vegetables grown in community gardens in Europe have beenassessed for Toxocara egg contamination. Sixteen community gardens participatedin the study, providing 82 vegetable samples fit for analysis. Study participantsalso completed an anonymous questionnaire on observed visits to the sites bydefinitive hosts of Toxocara. Comparison of egg recovery methods was performedusing lettuce samples spiked with a series of Toxocara spp. egg concentrations,with sedimentation and centrifugal concentration retrieving the highest number ofeggs. A sample (100 g) of each vegetable type obtained from participatingcommunity gardens was tested for the presence of Toxocara eggs using theoptimised method. Two lettuce samples tested positive for Toxocara spp. eggs,giving a prevalence of 2.4% (95% CI =1.3-3.5%) for vegetable samples overall, and6.5% (95% CI = 4.7-8.3%; n = 31) specifically for lettuce. Questionnaire datarevealed that foxes, cats and dogs frequently visited the community gardens inthe study, with 88% (68/77) of respondents reporting seeing a definitive hostspecies or the faeces of a definitive host at their site. This proof-of-conceptstudy showed for the first time the presence of Toxocara spp. eggs on vegetables grown in the UK, as well as within the soil where these vegetables originated,and highlights biosecurity and zoonotic risks in community gardens. This studyestablishes a method for assessment of Toxocara spp. eggs on vegetable produceand paves the way for larger-scale investigations of Toxocara spp. eggcontamination on field-grown vegetables.

TI  - Assessment of listing and categorisation of animal diseases within the framework of the Animal Health Law (Regulation (EU) No 2016/429): antimicrobial-resistantPseudomonas aeruginosa in dogs and cats.
PG  - e07310
LID - 10.2903/j.efsa.2022.7310 [doi]
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) was identified among the most relevantantimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria in the EU for dogs and cats in a previous scientific opinion. Thus, it has been assessed according to the criteria of theAnimal Health Law (AHL), in particular criteria of Article 7 on disease profileand impacts, Article 5 on its eligibility to be listed, Annex IV for itscategorisation according to disease prevention and control rules as in Article 9,and Article 8 for listing animal species related to the bacterium. The assessmenthas been performed following a methodology previously published. The outcome isthe median of the probability ranges provided by the experts, which indicateswhether each criterion is fulfilled (lower bound >/= 66%) or not (upper bound </=33%), or whether there is uncertainty about fulfilment. Reasoning points arereported for criteria with uncertain outcome. According to the assessment hereperformed, it is uncertain whether AMR P. aeruginosa can be considered eligibleto be listed for Union intervention according to Article 5 of the AHL (33-90%probability). According to the criteria in Annex IV, for the purpose ofcategorisation related to the level of prevention and control as in Article 9 of the AHL, the AHAW Panel concluded that the bacterium does not meet the criteriain Sections 1, 2, 3 and 4 (Categories A, B, C and D; 0-5%, 1-5%, 5-33% and 5-33% probability of meeting the criteria, respectively) and the AHAW Panel wasuncertain whether it meets the criteria in Section 5 (Category E, 33-90%probability of meeting the criteria). The animal species to be listed for AMR P. aeruginosa according to Article 8 criteria are mainly dogs and cats.
