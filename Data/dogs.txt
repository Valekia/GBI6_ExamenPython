AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the analgesic efficacy of grapiprant to carprofen for thetreatment of postoperative pain and inflammation in dogs followingovariohysterectomy. ANIMALS: 12 purpose-bred adult sexually intact femaleBeagles. PROCEDURES: Dogs were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups:grapiprant (2 mg/kg, PO; n = 6) or carprofen (4.4 mg/kg, PO; n = 6), 1.5 hoursprior to ovariohysterectomy (OVH) and every 24 hours afterward for 3 total doses.An ultrafiltration probe was placed within the OVH incision to collectinterstitial fluid (ISF). Pain and inflammation were assessed by maskedinvestigators via mechanical nociceptive threshold testing and the short form of the Glasgow Composite Pain Scale before drug administration and at multiple time points for 72 hours following dosing and surgery. ISF samples were collected atthe same time points to assess prostaglandin E2 concentrations at the site ofinflammation. RESULTS: In both groups, pain scale scores were highest in theimmediate postoperative period and decreased over time. In both treatment groups,there were significant (P = 0.003) differences in mechanical nociceptivethreshold results over time when compared with baseline, but there was nodifference between groups. Prostaglandin E2 concentrations in ISF were higher in dogs receiving grapiprant compared with carprofen (P < 0.001). One dog in thecarprofen group required rescue analgesia. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results of thispreliminary study suggested both carprofen and grapiprant may be effective forpostoperative pain following OVH in dogs; however, additional studies arewarranted to determine grapiprant's effectiveness in a larger and more diversepopulation of dogs.

TI  - Positron emission tomography: a horse in the musculoskeletal imaging race.
LID - 10.2460/ajvr.22.03.0051 [doi]
LID - ajvr.22.03.0051 [pii]
AB  - Positron emission tomography (PET) has established itself as a pertinent tool in equine musculoskeletal imaging in the last few years. With the ability to providefunctional information regarding both bone and soft tissues, PET has foundseveral clinical applications in horses. PET is currently used in horses as anenhanced bone scan, providing high-resolution 3-dimensional information, inparticular for imaging of the racehorse fetlock. Combined with CT and MRI, PET isparticularly pertinent in horses for the assessment of subchondral bone andenthesis. The development of a dedicated PET scanner to image the distal limb of horses with standing sedation led to new applications, where PET is used as afirst-line advanced imaging tool, in particular for foot, fetlock, and tarsalimaging. A complimentary clinical review of when to seek advanced imaging inequine athletes can be found in the companion Currents in One Health by Garrettin the July 2022 issue of the Journal of American Veterinary Medical Association.The clinical use of PET in human medicine remains mainly focused on oncologicalimaging; however, numerous small-scale clinical studies have demonstratedvaluable applications for musculoskeletal imaging. These include assessment offoot and ankle pain, osteoarthritis of the knee and hip, osteoporosis, responseto bisphosphonates, and chronic osteomyelitis. The use of musculoskeletal PET in dogs remains quite limited, but a few studies have recently been published andclinical interest is growing. The available research data and clinicalapplications between horses, humans, and dogs are currently quite disparate, but all suggest great promises for earlier and more accurate clinical diagnosis, aswell as better understanding of pathophysiology and response to treatment.Translating knowledge from a species to another will undoubtedly help furthergrowth of musculoskeletal PET.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To collect kinetic gait reference data of dogs of 2 breeds in theirgrowth period during walking and trotting gait, to describe their development,and to investigate the weight support pattern over time. ANIMALS: 8Foxhound-Boxer-Ingelheim Labrador Retriever mixed breeds and 4 Beagles.PROCEDURES: Ground reaction force variables (GRFs), peak vertical force andvertical impulse, and temporal variables (TVs) derived therefrom; time ofoccurrence; and stance times were collected. Body weight distribution (BWD) wasevaluated. Six measurements, each containing 1 trial in walking and 1 trial introtting gait, were taken at age 10, 17, 26, 34, 52, and 78 weeks. The studyperiod started July 17, 2013 and lasted until October 7, 2015. Area under thecurve with respect to increase was applied. The difference of area under thecurve with respect to increase values between breeds and gaits was analyzed usingeither the t test or the Mann-Whitney test. Generalized mixed linear models were applied. RESULTS: Significant differences in gait and breed comparisons werefound. Growing dogs showed a forelimb-dominated gait. The development of GRF and TV values over the study period were described. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Referencevalues for GRFs, TVs, and BWDs in growing dogs were given. A cranial shift inweight support over time was found during trotting gait. Smaller, younger dogswalked and trotted more inconsistently.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare sedative, cardiopulmonary, and adverse effects of 3nalbuphine doses, administered alone or in combination with acepromazine, indogs. ANIMALS: 6 healthy dogs. PROCEDURES: Dogs were administered nalbuphine(1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 mg/kg, intravenously [IV]) combined with physiologic salinesolution (1 mL, IV; treatments SN1.0, SN1.5, and SN2.0, respectively) oracepromazine (0.05 mg/kg, IV; treatments AN1.0, AN1.5, and AN2.0, respectively)in random order, with a 1-week washout interval between treatments. Sedationscores, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, respiratory rate, and rectaltemperature were recorded before and 20 minutes after administration of salinesolution or acepromazine (T0), and nalbuphine was administered at T0.Measurements were repeated 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after nalbuphineadministration. RESULTS: Treatments SN and AN resulted in at least 120 minutes ofmild sedation and 60 minutes of moderate sedation, respectively. Sedation scores were greater for treatments AN1.0, AN1.5, and AN2.0 at various times, comparedwith scores for treatments SN1.0, SN1.5, and SN2.0, respectively. Administration of nalbuphine alone resulted in salivation and panting in some dogs. CLINICALRELEVANCE: All nalbuphine doses promoted mild sedation when administered alone,and moderate sedation when combined with acepromazine. Greater doses ofnalbuphine did not increase sedation scores. All treatments resulted in minimalchanges in heart rate, respiratory rate, rectal temperature, and mean arterialpressure. Nalbuphine alone resulted in few adverse effects.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the pharmacokinetics and ex vivo pharmacodynamics of oralfirocoxib administration in New Zealand White rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus).ANIMALS: 6 healthy New Zealand White rabbits. PROCEDURES: Pharmacokinetics weredetermined from plasma concentrations measured via ultra performance liquidchromatography-tandem mass spectrometry after oral administration of firocoxib ata dose of 3.74 to 4.20 mg/kg. Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using noncompartmental methods. Pharmacodynamics of firocoxib were evaluated by measuring plasma concentrations of thromboxane and prostaglandin via ELISAs as surrogatemarkers of cyclooxygenase enzyme isoform inhibition. RESULTS: The terminal rateconstant was 0.07 hours (range, 0.05 to 0.11 h). The mean maximum concentration(Cmax) and time to Cmax were 0.16 microg/mL and 3.81 hours (range, 2.0 to 8.0 h),respectively. Mean residence time was 15.02 hours. Mean elimination half-life was9.12 hours. For the pharmacodynamic analysis, firocoxib administration did notdemonstrate a significant difference between any time point for prostaglandin E2 and only a significant difference between 24 and 48 hours for thromboxane B2.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Although the pharmacokinetic research supports that plasmafirocoxib concentrations that would be therapeutic in dogs are achieved inrabbits, the pharmacodynamic results do not demonstrate a significant difference in levels of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition, which indirectly reflects theanti-inflammatory effects of the drug. Further pharmacodynamic studies andmultidose studies are warranted to determine the efficacy and safety of this drugin rabbits.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the enhancement accuracy of a triple-phase abdominal CTangiography (CTA) protocol in dogs and explore the patient, scan, and contrastparameters associated with accuracy of enhancement. ANIMALS: 233 client-owneddogs that underwent routine abdominal CTA. PROCEDURES: During each CTA study, thesubjective timing accuracy (early, ideal, late) of the 3 obtained vascular phases(arterial, venous, delayed) was scored by consensus (2 reviewers) at 4 targetorgans (liver, pancreas, left kidney, and spleen). These scores were evaluatedfor statistical associations with 21 study variables (patient, scan, and contrastmedium). The objective enhancement (HU) for each target organ was also comparedstatistically with subjective timing accuracy scores and the study variables.RESULTS: The study protocol performed best for the pancreas, moderately for theliver, and worse for the spleen and left kidney. Measurements of scan length and time were associated positively with phase lateness for most target organs andphases. Increased heart rate was the most significant patient factor associatedpositively with phase lateness within the liver (all phases), pancreas (arterial and venous phases), and kidney (arterial phase). Contrast medium variables wereless associated with timing accuracy in this protocol. Objective enhancement (HU)correlated poorly with subjective phase timing accuracy and study variables.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Scan time, scan length, and heart rate were the predominantvariables contributing to lateness in this canine abdominal CTA protocol. Thefindings of this exploratory study may aid in protocol adjustment and choice ofincluded anatomy for dogs undergoing routine abdominal CTA.

LID - ajvr.22.05.0077 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify and characterize the gross and histological lesionsassociated with air pollution in the lungs of dogs from various locations inTrinidad. ANIMALS: 56 fresh lungs were obtained from already euthanized adultdogs collected from different locations in Trinidad at the Trinidad and TobagoSociety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. PROCEDURES: Lung specimens wereexamined grossly and tissue samples were taken for routine histologicexamination. RESULTS: Histological examination showed that 51.8% of the dogs had evidence of anthracosis. Dogs with anthracosis had greater median lesion scorescompared to dogs without anthracosis (P = .022). There was no association betweenthe presence of anthracosis and any other lesion in this study (P > .05).CLINICAL RELEVANCE: There was evidence that dogs with anthracosis had a greaterdegree of nonspecific lung histologic lesions. Using the dog as a sentinel model for human exposure in Trinidad, our findings indicate that environmental airpollution may also have an effect on the respiratory health of the humanpopulation. It is important for the public to be aware of air pollution, and the government of Trinidad and Tobago should develop an intervention protocol alongwith veterinary and human medical epidemiologists to reduce air pollution in the country.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272297 [doi]
AB  - The diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) in humans is associated with high altitude, few sunshine hours, cold climate, and winter. The goals of this studywere to investigate seasonal and geographic patterns of DM diagnosis in UnitedStates of America (USA) dogs with juvenile and mature onset DM. Data werecollected by means of an online survey widely distributed in the USA throughbreed clubs, academic veterinary institutions, private veterinary referralpractices, social media outlets, and the American Kennel Club. Juvenile DM (JDM) and mature onset DM were defined as DM with an age of onset <365 days and DM withan age of onset >/=365 days, respectively. Meteorological seasons were definedas: winter from December through February, spring from March through May, summer from June through August, and fall from September through November. Fourgeographic regions were also defined as the West, North, South, and Centralregions of the USA. Nonoverlapping 95% confidence intervals (CI) for season,geographic region, and breed specific proportions of dogs with JDM wereconsidered statistically significantly different. The study included 933 dogswith mature onset DM and 27 dogs with JDM. Dogs were diagnosed with DMsignificantly more in the winter and northern USA compared to all other seasonsand all other geographic regions, respectively. The prevalence of JDM among dogs with DM was 2.8%. The proportion of dogs with JDM among pure breeds was notsignificantly different than the proportion of JDM in mixed breed dogs. It isconcluded that winter and cold climate could be shared environmental factorsinfluencing DM expression in dogs and humans. Additionally, pure breed dogs donot appear to be at increased risk for JDM compared to mixed breed dogs,indicating that factors other than genetics could influence spontaneous JDMdevelopment in dogs.

TI  - Outcomes of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug toxicosis treated withtherapeutic plasma exchange in 62 dogs.
LID - 10.1111/jvim.16507 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is gaining popularity for themanagement of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) overdose in dogs.HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: Describe a population of dogs treated with TPE for NSAIDoverdose. ANIMALS: Sixty-two dogs with NSAID overdose treated with TPE. METHODS: Multicenter retrospective study of dogs treated with TPE for ibuprofen,carprofen, or naproxen overdose. RESULTS: The median dose of ibuprofen, carprofenor naproxen ingested was 533 mg/kg (range, 36-4857 mg/kg), 217 mg/kg (range,88-625 mg/kg) and 138 mg/kg (range, 26-3000 mg/kg), respectively. Based onpreviously established toxic ranges for each NSAID, 2 (3.2%), 14 (22.6%), and 46 (74.2%) dogs ingested a gastrointestinal, renal, and neurological toxic dose,respectively. The median time between ingestion and presentation was 4 hours(range, 1-20 hours). The median number of plasma volumes processed was 1.6(range, 0.4-2.2). The median TPE session duration was 2 hours (range, 1-4.5hours). Circuit clotting developed during 8 (12.9%) sessions. Patient adverseevents reported during 21 (33.8%) sessions consisted of urticaria (12.9%),asymptomatic hypocalcemia (9.6%), and hypotension (9.6%). The median duration of hospitalization was 2.25 days (range, 1-11 days). Sixty-one (98.4%) dogs survivedto discharge, and none were rehospitalized. Thirty-one (91.1%) of the 34 dogswith at least 1 follow-up visit were not azotemic at the time of reevaluation.CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: This population of dogs managed with TPE hadexcellent outcomes, even in cases of high NSAID dose ingestion. When TPE isavailable and the time frame is appropriate, this extracorporeal modality should be considered for the management of NSAID overdose.

TI  - The use of autologous skeletal muscle progenitor cells for adjunctive treatmentof presumptive urethral sphincter mechanism incompetence in female dogs.
LID - 10.1111/jvim.16505 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urethral sphincter mechanism incompetence (USMI) is a common problem in female dogs, but some dogs fail to achieve continence with standard treatment.Urethral submucosal injection of autologous skeletal muscle progenitor cells(skMPCs) previously has been shown to restore urethral function in a canine modelof USMI. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVE: To determine if urethral submucosal injection ofskMPC alters continence in dogs with USMI that had previously failed standardmedical management. We hypothesized that the injections would lead to improvedcontinence. ANIMALS: Fifteen client-owned dogs with USMI that had failed standardmedical management. METHODS: Dogs were prospectively enrolled into a single-armedclinical trial. Once enrolled, a triceps muscle of each dog was biopsied; thetissue specimens were digested, cultured, and expanded to 100 million cellsbefore injection into the urethral submucosa using a surgical approach.Continence was assessed at baseline and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months post-injectionusing continence scores and urethral pressure profilometry. RESULTS: Mediancontinence scores increased significantly from baseline at 3, 6, 12, and 24months. Increases were seen in 14 of 15 dogs with 7, 6 or 1 dog achieving scores of 5, 4 or 3, respectively. Additional medication was required to achievecontinence in all but 2 dogs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Urethralsubmucosal injection of skMPC can be used adjunctively to improve continence indogs with difficult to manage USMI. The procedure is labor intensive but welltolerated; most dogs will require continued medication to remain continent.

TI  - A comparison of personality traits of gifted word learner and typical bordercollies.
LID - 10.1007/s10071-022-01657-x [doi]
AB  - While personality and cognition are distinct domains, some personality traits mayaffect the capacity for problem-solving. It was suggested that there is apositive association between the Playfulness trait and problem-solvingperformance in humans. Studies on giftedness (extremely good capacity in the caseof a specific skill), typically aimed to reveal the genetic, experiential, andmental origins of such extreme inter-individual variation. We exploited recentfindings on giftedness in a specific cognitive skill, object label learning, indogs to explore the potential association between this exceptional skill andpersonality traits. We administered the Dog Personality Questionnaire to 21gifted dog owners and compared the personality traits of their dogs to those ofmatched samples of 43 Hungarian and 101 Austrian typical dogs, i.e., dogs lackingthis exceptional capacity. Since most Gifted Word Learner dogs are Bordercollies, we restricted our analysis to dogs of this breed. We hypothesized thatthe Gifted Word Learner dogs may show higher levels of Playfulness. As expected, we found that the gifted Border collies were rated as more playful than both the Hungarian and Austrian typical ones. Our results suggest that an extremely highlevel of Playfulness is associated with giftedness in a specific cognitive trait in dogs: the capacity to learn object verbal labels, thus opening newpossibilities for comparative research on the relationship between giftedness andpersonality.

TI  - Evaluation of the blood neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio as a biomarker formeningoencephalitis of unknown etiology in dogs.
LID - 10.1111/jvim.16512 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been identified as abiomarker in several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Multiple sclerosis(MS) has been found to be associated with changes in the NLR in humans.OBJECTIVES: To examine the diagnostic value of the NLR in meningoencephalitis of unknown etiology (MUE) in dogs. ANIMALS: Thirty-eight MUE dogs, 20 hydrocephalic dogs, 10 brain tumor (BT) dogs, 32 idiopathic epilepsy (IE) dogs, and 41 healthy dogs. METHODS: Retrospective study. Medical records were reviewed to identifydogs with a diagnosis of neurologic disease. The NLR was determined in all dogs. RESULTS: The median NLR was significantly higher in MUE dogs (6.08) than inhealthy (1.78, P < .001), IE (2.50, P < .05), and hydrocephalic dogs (1.79, P <.05). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the NLR fordifferentiation between MUE and healthy dogs was 0.96, and between the MUE dogsand dogs with other forebrain diseases was 0.86. An optimal cutoff of 4.16 forthe NLR had a sensitivity of 71.1% and specificity of 83.9% to differentiate the MUE dogs from the dogs with other forebrain diseases. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICALIMPORTANCE: The NLR could be a biomarker for diagnosing MUE and distinguishing itfrom other intracranial diseases in dogs.

AB  - The administration of antiretrovirals (ARVs) for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis(PrEP) is highly efficacious and may benefit from new long-acting (LA) drugdelivery approaches. This paper describes a subcutaneous, reservoir-style implantfor the LA delivery of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) and documents the preclinical assessment of implant safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) in New Zealand White (NZW)rabbits (3 groups of n = 5), beagle dogs (2 groups of n = 6), and rhesus macaques(2 groups of n = 3). Placebo implants were placed in rabbits (n = 10) and dogs (n= 12). Implant parameters, including selection of the TAF form, choice ofexcipient, and PCL formulation were tuned to achieve targeted concentrations ofthe active anabolite of TAF, tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP), within peripheralblood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and mucosal tissues relevant to HIV transmission.Sustained concentrations of TFV-DP in PBMCs over 100 fmol/10(6) cells wereachieved in all animal species indicating that the implants effectively deliveredTAF for 3-6 months. Unlike placebo implants without TAF, all active implantsresulted in local adverse events (AEs) proximal to the implant ranging inseverity from mild to moderate and included dermal inflammation and necrosisacross all species. Despite these AEs, the implant performed as designed andachieved a constant drug release profile, supporting the continued development ofthis drug delivery platform.

AB  - In veterinary medicine, sildenafil is most frequently used to treat pulmonaryhypertension, but has also been investigated and used as a treatment forcongenital megaesophagus and ischemic infarcts. With the increasing use, theeffects of sildenafil on the portal vasculature in the dog have not beenpreviously evaluated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectssildenafil has on the portal vasculature, which anecdotally may have causeddecreased portal vein pressure in an adult dog. The ultrasound cross-sectionalarea of the aorta, cross-sectional area of the portal vein, and portal vein bloodflow velocity were acquired in dogs prior to administration, and 45, 90, and 120 min after oral administration of sildenafil for the treatment of pulmonaryhypertension. Thirteen dogs were enrolled in the study. No statisticallysignificant difference was detected between all measured values and thecongestion index at all time points. A trend was identified that demonstratedprogressively lower portal vein velocity with each evaluation, but this was notsignificant. Although this study had a small sample size, sildenafil was notshown to have a significant effect on the size or blood flow velocity of theportal vasculature. The hepatic buffer system, designed to maintain a constantblood flow to the liver, may be a contributing factor, but further studies with alarger sample size will be required for further evaluation.

AB  - Allergic dermatitis is the most common type of skin disease in dogs. Of all dogs,20 to 30% present with some type of allergic dermatitis. Pruritus is one of themost important signs of allergic dermatitis and is often the most challenging to control. Interleukin-31 (IL-31) has been found to be one of the main initiatorsof pruritus in dogs with allergic dermatitis. Cytopoint(R), a caninizedmonoclonal anti-IL-31 antibody, has been shown to be effective for the treatment of dogs against allergic dermatitis and atopic dermatitis. US label indication. Arecent retrospective study reported that Cytopoint achieved treatment success in 87.8% of the cases with allergic dermatitis. No prospective cohort studies havebeen performed investigating the effects of Cytopoint in dogs with allergicdermatitis using the dosing protocol prescribed on the product label in theUnited States. In this study, our objectives were to assess the efficacy ofCytopoint for treatment of canine allergic dermatitis of variable etiologies and management of the associated pruritus, and add to the body of evidence available to the veterinarian as they make treatment recommendations. Dogs included in thisstudy had moderate to severe pruritus according to the Pruritus Visual AnalogScale (PVAS; >/= 50 mm) and a history of likely continuation of pruritus at thetime of presentation. On day 0, investigators recorded the initial body weightand every patient received one dose of Cytopoint (minimum 2 mg/kg SQ) and anisoxazoline product for parasite control. Treatment success for this study wasdefined as a >/=20 mm reduction in PVAS from Day 0. On Day 7, 94% of the dogs hadachieved treatment success. On Day 28, 98% had achieved treatment success andcumulatively by day 56, 100% of the dogs achieved treatment success. Thisprospective study provides evidence that Cytopoint effectively treats dogs withallergic dermatitis of different types and the associated pruritus.

LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.964177 [doi]
AB  - In this report the concomitant infection with canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2),Hepatozoon canis and Ehrlichia canis in two puppy dogs from Southern Italy isdescribed. Dogs were referred to a veterinary university hospital for the acuteonset of lethargy and gastrointestinal signs. A complete clinical andclinicopathological evaluation was carried out and the multiple infection wasconfirmed by microscopic detection of inclusion bodies in peripheral blood smear,rapid immunoenzymatic tests, indirect fluorescent antibody tests, and molecularassays. Sequence analysis revealed that the CPV-2 identified belonged to the 2cvariant and had amino acid residues in the predicted VP2 protein typical of"Asian-like" strains widespread in Asia and occasionally reported in Romania,Nigeria and Italy, particularly in the region of Sicily. Numerous monocytes were infected by both H. canis gamonts and E. canis morulae, suggesting that thisco-infection is not accidental and that E. canis preferably infects those cellsparasitized by H. canis. The clinical presentation of these animals was severebut supportive cares associated with early etiological therapy allowed a goodprognosis. Movement of puppies from geographic areas where vector-borne pathogensare endemic must be carefully evaluated and core vaccinations and ectoparasiteprevention treatments must be rigorously adopted.

TI  - Respiratory response to finger clamping in dogs under general anesthesia: Adescriptive pilot study.
PG  - 843956
LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.843956 [doi]
AB  - Aim of the study: The aim of this study was to assess the effects of anociceptive stimulus on respiratory variables in anesthetized dogs. Material and method: Eleven dogs received acepromazine administered intramuscularly (IM) at a dose of 0.04 mg kg(-1) 45 mins before induction of anesthesia. Loss ofconsciousness was obtained with midazolam at 0.2 mg kg(-1) and propofoladministered at a dose of 2 mg kg(-1) intravenously (IV). Orotracheal intubation was performed and anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in 100% oxygen.Inspired (VTi) and expired (VTe) tidal volume (VT), minute volume (VM),inspiratory and expiratory time (Ti; Te) were measured and recorded twice asecond by a spirometer. The Drive (VT/Ti) and Timing [Ti/(Ti+ Te)] werecalculated.After stabilizing the depth of anesthesia the variables measured bythe spirometer were recorded for 5 mins [T0-5-T0]. Then (T0) interdigitalclamping of the hind leg was performed until a withdrawal movement was observed. If no reaction occurred, the clamp was left in place for 60s. After removal ofthe clamp, respiratory variables were measured continuously for another 5 mins[T0-T0+5]. At T0+5 morphine (0.2 mg kg(-1) IV) was administered. Five minuteslater (T0+10), a second clamp test was performed, using the same procedure. AtT0+15 the data recording was stopped. Result: The results showed a largevariation in the individual values of Drive and Timing and are presented in adescriptive manner. The observation of Drive values over time showed variationsfollowing nociceptive stimuli. Drive appears to have increased only for thosedogs that did not move during the stimulus, and were therefore pinched for a full60 s. In contrast, the study of the Timing values revealed no difference between the data before and after nociceptive stimulation. However Timing seems toincrease after morphine administration. Conclusion: Drive remains a parameterthat needs to be studied in depth to determine its sensitivity and precocity tomonitor acute nociception.

PG  - 934789
LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.934789 [doi]
AB  - Dachshunds are at significant risk of experiencing thoracolumbar intervertebraldisk herniation (IVDH) during their lifetimes. Standard of care includes advancedimaging, surgical intervention, and postoperative rehabilitation. Conservativemanagement is commonly recommended for cases where the standard of care isdeclined, and little is known about the prognosis of treatment with conservative management and rehabilitation (nonsurgical rehabilitation). This retrospectivecohort study assessed 12-week functional outcome and recurrence of clinical signsin 40 dachshunds with T3-L3 myelopathy presumed to be due to Hansen's Type I discherniation, treated with nonsurgical rehabilitation. The overall prognosis wasgood with 34 of 40 (85.0%, 95% CI 70.2-94.2) dachshunds achieving functional pet status by 12 weeks postinjury. Modified Frankel Score at presentation wassignificantly (p < 0.001) higher in dogs with a positive 12-week outcome comparedto dogs that did not recover by 12 weeks. All 27 dogs with motor function atpresentation had a positive outcome. Of the 9 dogs exhibiting paraplegia withintact deep nociception at presentation, 7 dogs (77.8%) had achieved a positiveoutcome by 12 weeks. None of the 4 dogs persistently lacking deep nociception hada positive outcome. Among 27 dogs with a positive outcome for whom follow-uprecords were available, the 1- and 2-year recurrence rates for T3-L3 myelopathywere 5 and 11%, respectively. Nonsurgical rehabilitation should be considered in dachshunds with mild to moderate T3-L3 myelopathy or in severe cases whenadvanced imaging and surgical intervention are not possible.

TI  - RNA sequencing reveals dynamic expression of spleen lncRNAs and mRNAs in Beagledogs infected by Toxocara canis.
PG  - 279
LID - 10.1186/s13071-022-05380-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Toxocara canis is a cosmopolitan parasite with a significant adverse impact on the health of humans and animals. The spleen is a major immune organthat plays essential roles in protecting the host against various infections.However, its role in T. canis infection has not received much attention. METHODS:We performed sequencing-based transcriptome profiling of long noncoding RNA(lncRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in the spleen of Beagle puppies at24 h post-infection (hpi), 96 hpi and 36 days post-infection (dpi). Deepsequencing of RNAs isolated from the spleen of six puppies (three infected andthree control) at each time point after infection was conducted. RESULTS: Ouranalysis revealed 614 differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs and 262 DEmRNAs at 24hpi; 726 DElncRNAs and 878 DEmRNAs at 96 hpi; and 686 DElncRNAs and 504 DEmRNAsat 36 dpi. Of those, 35 DElncRNA transcripts and 11 DEmRNAs were detected at all three time points post-infection. Many DE genes were enriched in immune response,such as ifit1, ifit2 and rorc. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichmentanalysis revealed that some genes (e.g. prkx and tnfrsf11a) were involved in the T cell receptor signaling pathway, calcium signaling pathway, Ras signalingpathway and NF-kappaB signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study show marked alterations in the expression profiles of spleen lncRNAs and mRNAs,with possible implications in the pathophysiology of toxocariasis.

AB  - BACKFROUND: Treatment options for metacarpal/metatarsal fractures includeconservative and surgical management. The aim of this study is to determinewhether there is any significant difference in healing and complication rates,between open and closed treatment. Medical records of dogs and cats withmetacarpal/metatarsal fractures with complete follow-up were retrospectivelyreviewed. Patients were allocated in two groups: open or closed stabilization.Minor and major complications were recorded and compared. Fracture healing wasclassified as good, delayed and non-union, and it was statistically compared.RESULTS: Sixty-three patients (35 dogs and 28 cats) were included. Thirty-onewere treated with an open approach and 32 by a closed stabilization. Regardingfracture healing a significantly higher proportion of delayed healing/non-unionwas found in the closed group (12/32 vs 2/31). Regarding postoperativecomplications, a significantly higher number of animals in the open group did notdevelop any complications (12/31 vs 3/32). A significantly higher proportion ofminor complications were reported in the closed group (27/32 vs 12/31). However, a higher number of major complications was reported in the open group (7/31 vs2/32) although this was not statistically significant. Fracture malalignment was significantly more prevalent in patients undergoing closed stabilization (11/32vs 2/31). CONCLUSION: According to the results, better healing, fracturealignment and a lower complication rate are found when fractures are stabilisedwith an open technique. However, other factors such as configuration of thefracture, soft tissue involvement, patient s character and client s situationwould also need to be taken into account in the decision of stabilizationtechnique.

TI  - Preclinical characterization of vadadustat (AKB-6548), an oral small moleculehypoxia inducible factor prolyl-4-hydroxylase inhibitor, for the potentialtreatment of renal anemia.

AB  - Pharmacological inhibition of prolyl-4-hydroxylase domain (PHD) enzymesstabilizes hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), transcription factors that activate target genes that, among others, increase erythropoietin (EPO) synthesis,resulting in the production of new red blood cells (RBCs). Herein, we summarizethe preclinical characteristics of the small molecule HIF prolyl-4-hydroxylaseinhibitor vadadustat (AKB-6548), which is in development for the treatment ofanemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Vadadustat inhibits enzyme activity of all three human PHD isozymes, PHD1, PHD2, and PHD3, with similar low nanomolar inhibitory constant values. PHD enzyme inhibition by vadadustat iscompetitive with endogenous cofactor 2-oxoglutarate and is insensitive to freeiron concentration. In the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (Hep 3B) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, PHD inhibition by vadadustat leads to thetime- and concentration-dependent stabilization of HIF-1a and HIF-2a. In Hep 3Bcells, this in turn results in the synthesis and secretion of EPO; vascularendothelial growth factor is not measured at detectable levels. A single oraldose of vadadustat in rats potently increases circulating levels of EPO, anddaily oral dosing for 14 days increases RBC indices in healthy rats and in the5/6 nephrectomy model of CKD. In mice and dogs, once-daily repeat oral dosingincreases hemoglobin and hematocrit. Vadadustat has a relatively short half-life in all non-clinical species evaluated and does not accumulate when administeredas a single bolus dose (oral or IV) or upon repeat oral dosing. Thepharmacological profile of vadadustat supports continued development fortreatment of renal anemia. Significance Statement Vadadustat (AKB-6548) is anorally bioavailable small molecule prolyl-4-hydroxylase inhibitor in development for anemia of chronic kidney disease. It is an equipotent inhibitor of the three human PHD isoforms, which activates erythropoiesis through stabilization ofHIF-1a and HIF-2a, increasing production of EPO, without detectable stimulationof VEGF.

AB  - Toscana virus (TOSV) is major meningitis and meningoencephalitis agent in theMediterranean basin. Dogs are frequently exposed to TOSV; thereby they cancontribute to estimating its circulation. In Algeria, little is known about itscirculation, and available data are restricted to the Kabylian region. Toinvestigate the current situation in Algeria, a total of 205 dog sera collectedfrom 13 different wilayas over the country were analyzed by using in-house EnzymeLinked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and microneutralization test (MNT). An overallseroprevalence rate of 20% (14.5-25.5%) was observed by ELISA. Whereas, aseroprevalence rate of 4.56% (1.65-7.43%) was recorded by microneutralizationtest elucidating the exact occurrence of TOSV exposure in dogs, in Algeria.Positive dogs were detected from the areas of Algiers, Bejaia, Blida, Bouira,Medea, Setif, and Tlemcen in the north; Laghouat in the high lands andTamanrasset in great Sahara. Only one serum, originating from Bejaia in the northeast, was positive for both testing methods, while 8/9 positive sera in MNTremained negative in ELISA. MNT negative/ELISA positive result of 40/41 mightsuggest evidence for dog transmission, and circulation of phleboviruses otherthan TOSV. Noticeably, TOSV and antigenically related viruses are largelyprevalent. Thus, they are not only confined to Kabylia region, but are widespreadin Algeria, despite its climate diversity.

TI  - Attitudes of optometrists towards artificial intelligence for the diagnosis ofretinal disease: A cross-sectional mail-out survey.
LID - 10.1111/opo.13034 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based systems have demonstrated greatpotential in improving the diagnostic accuracy of retinal disease but are yet to achieve widespread acceptance in routine clinical practice. Clinician attitudesare known to influence implementation. Therefore, this study aimed to identifyoptometrists' attitudes towards the use of AI to assist in diagnosing retinaldisease. METHODS: A paper-based survey was designed to assess general attitudestowards AI in diagnosing retinal disease and motivators/barriers for future use. Two clinical scenarios for using AI were evaluated: (1) at the point of care toobtain a diagnostic recommendation, versus (2) after the consultation to provide a second opinion. Relationships between participant characteristics and attitudestowards AI were explored. The survey was mailed to 252 randomly selectedpractising optometrists across Australia, with repeat mail-outs tonon-respondents. RESULTS: The response rate was 53% (133/252). Respondents' mean (SD) age was 42.7 (13.3) years, and 44.4% (59/133) identified as female, whilst1.5% (2/133) identified as gender diverse. The mean number of years practising inprimary eye care was 18.8 (13.2) years with 64.7% (86/133) working in anindependently owned practice. On average, responding optometrists reportedpositive attitudes (mean score 4.0 out of 5, SD 0.8) towards using AI as a toolto aid the diagnosis of retinal disease, and would be more likely to use AI if itis proven to increase patient access to healthcare (mean score 4.4 out of 5, SD0.6). Furthermore, optometrists expressed a statistically significant preference for using AI after the consultation to provide a second opinion rather thanduring the consultation, at the point-of-care (+0.12, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS:Optometrists have positive attitudes towards the future use of AI as an aid todiagnose retinal disease. Understanding clinician attitudes and preferences forusing AI may help maximise its clinical potential and ensure its successfultranslation into practice.

PG  - 1-15

AB  - CASE HISTORIES: The medical records of three dogs, presenting to the surgerydepartment at a tertiary private referral hospital (Cork, Republic of Ireland),were retrospectively reviewed. The patients presented for investigation of a3-day history of progressive lethargy, decreased appetite and hindlimb weakness(Case 1); brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome and the development ofabnormal licking behaviours (Case 2); and a 2-month history of increased thirstwith elevated alanine aminotransferase in serum (Case 3). CLINICAL FINDINGS: Case1 presented with tachycardia, hindlimb paraparesis and neck pain, while Case 2presented with facial conformation abnormalities consistent with brachycephalicobstructive airway syndrome. General physical examination and neurologicalassessment were within normal limits for Case 3. Baseline serum biochemistrymeasurements, in all three patients, indicated elevated activities of alanineaminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase, as well as elevated concentrations of resting bile acids (BA), suggestive of an extrahepatic portosystemic shunt.Abdominal computed tomography (CT) angiography was performed, for each dog, whichrevealed the presence of a portoazygous shunt (PAS) with final insertion into thecaudal azygos vein within the thorax. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: Abdominal CTangiography images were used for surgical planning and a right-sided intercostal thoracotomy was performed. The location of the thoracotomy was patient-specificand located cranial to the diaphragm, either at the point of PAS insertion intothe azygos vein or one rib-space caudal to the insertion, as determined bypre-operative CT images. The intercostal thoracotomy provided good visualisation of the PAS and an appropriate surgical field for placement of a thin film bandaround the PAS. No surgical complications or post-attenuation seizures wereobserved. All patients appeared comfortable on oral analgesia and were dischargedfrom the hospital by 48 hours after surgery. All patients demonstrated a clinicalimprovement when reassessed 6-8 weeks after surgery, and Cases 2 and 3demonstrated a reduction of resting BA concentrations to within normal limits.The third patient (Case 1) had a considerable reduction in the concentration ofresting BA from >140 micromol/L to 20 micromol/L (reference range 0-10micromol/L) 6-8 weeks after surgery. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A right-sidedintercostal thoracotomy can be considered for surgical management of PAS in dogs.While both intraoperative and short-term results appear promising, furtherprospective studies are required before this approach can be recommended as thepreferred approach for PAS attenuation.

AB  - Pet food can be a source of microbiological hazards that might affect companionanimals and owners. Even though owners usually rely on conventional pet diets,such as extruded diets, new feeding practices, such as raw meat-based diets(RMBDs), have grown. RMBDs' benefits are still scientifically uncertain, whileits risks have been documented. The use of canine RMBDs might increase theexposure to zoonotic pathogens, such as Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter spp., among others. Identifying pathogen prevalence in canine food and pets is required to contribute to public health measures. The aims of thisstudy were: (1) to compare the microbiological quality of RMBDs and extrudeddiets (2) to identify and compare the prevalence of Salmonella spp.,Campylobacter jejuni, and L. monocytogenes from raw and extruded canine diets andcanine fecal samples, and (3) to characterize pet owners according to the dietchosen to be used on their pets, their motivations for using RMBDs, and theirknowledge about benefits and risks related to this feeding practice. Conventionaland molecular microbiological methods were used to identify pathogen presencefrom food and fecal samples, while pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) wasperformed to evaluate the clonal relationship between isolates. Aerobic platecounts for RMBDs were higher than those detected for extruded diets. Salmonellaspp. and L. monocytogenes were isolated from 35.7% (15/42) RMBDs, whileSalmonella spp., C. jejuni, and L. monocytogenes from 33.3% (11/33) fecal samplesfrom RMBD-fed dogs. From the RMBD samples positive to Salmonella spp., chickenwas the main meat ingredient composing the diets. PFGE analysis confirmed agenetic association between Salmonella spp. isolates from fecal and raw foodsamples from the same household. We did not detect pathogens from extruded foodsamples or feces from extruded-fed dogs. Using a survey, we identified dogowners' unawareness and/or underestimation of risks related to RMBDs. Wedemonstrated that canine raw pet food might be a source of zoonotic foodbornepathogens that represent a health risk for both humans and pets. While clinicalfindings caused by the mentioned pathogens vary among pets, the zoonoticpotential implies a significant concern.

TI  - Dogs and the Good Life: A Cross-Sectional Study of the Association Between theDog-Owner Relationship and Owner Mental Wellbeing.
PG  - 903647
LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.903647 [doi]
AB  - Dog ownership is believed to benefit owner wellbeing but, contrary to popularbelief, there is limited evidence to suggest that simply owning a dog isassociated with improved mental health. This mixed-methods study investigateswhether dog owners with stronger relationships with their dogs experience better mental health. Participants (n = 1,693, adult United Kingdom dog owners)completed an online survey. Owners' health was measured using the validatedPROMIS questions regarding depression, anxiety, emotional support, andcompanionship. The dog-owner relationship was measured using the validated MDORS scale, which has three subscales: interaction, emotional closeness, and perceivedcosts. Univariable and multivariable linear regression analyses were conducted,adjusting for confounding factors. Additionally, positive and negative impacts ofdog ownership on mental wellbeing were coded from open questions using thematicanalysis. A stronger dog-owner relationship was associated with greater feelings of emotional support and companionship but poorer mental health in terms ofanxiety or depression. However, the perceived costs (burden) subscale wasconsistently associated with better mental health outcomes. Direction ofcausality cannot be inferred as people with poor mental health may acquire dogsto help relieve symptoms, which qualitative analysis supported. Key themesincluded positive impacts on owner wellbeing and happiness through providingpurpose, companionship and self-acceptance, pleasure and distraction, as well as lessening emotional pain and suffering and reducing risk behaviors. However,negative impacts of a strong relationship include anticipatory grief over loss ofthe dog, and concerns regarding the burden of responsibility and ability to meet dog's needs. Perceived ability to adequately meet dog's needs promoted personalgrowth and positive relationships with others, whereas perceived inability led tofeelings of guilt, or anger/frustration, and reduced autonomy and sense ofenvironmental mastery. Dog ownership contributes to both hedonic and eudaimonicwellbeing in multiple ways, including supporting owners through periods of poormental health and providing purpose. However, the burden of responsibility andowner and dog characteristics can create challenges, and owners may benefit from support in caring for their dogs and reducing problematic behaviors.

TI  - Medium chain fatty acid esters are effective even in azole resistant Malasseziapachydermatis.
LID - 10.1111/myc.13512 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malassezia (M.) pachydermatis as a frequent reason for dermatologicalconsultation in dogs and cats was recently shown to be lipid-dependent, too.Lipolytic activity is a prerequisite for activating antimicrobial effectivity of fatty acid esters. OBJECTIVES: It was therefore of interest whether it ispossible to induce this mechanism in M. pachydermatis and to identify possibledifferences between minimal and strong lipid-dependent strains. METHODS: In anagar dilution test, the minimal inhibitory concentrations of six fatty acidesters were determined for seventeen M. pachydermatis strains. GC analysis ofparent compounds and liberated fatty acids was used to quantify ester cleavage.RESULTS: Hydrolysis was observed in all test strains in a homogenous manner butwas dependent on the chemical structure. Lowest MICs (500ppm after 14 days ofincubation) were obtained applying glyceryl monocaprylate and 3-hydroxylpropylcaprylate, while the corresponding esters of undecylenic acid showed nearly twicethe value. As shown by GC analysis with the reference strains CBS 1879 and CBS1892 and 3-hydroxypropyl caprylate, hydrolysis and caprylic acid formation startsimmediately and was dependent on yeast density. Furthermore, nine azole resistantstrains isolated from dogs with treatment failures showed MIC values comparableto the other strains and no resistance to monohydric fatty acid esters.CONCLUSIONS: Medium chain fatty acid esters may represent a new therapeuticoption for veterinary use even in azole-resistant strains. The in vivoverification in M. pachydermatis associated dermatitis in dogs and cats will bethe next step for the successful development of new therapeutics.

TI  - Equine placental extract supplement as a night barking remedy in dogs withcognitive dysfunction syndrome.
LID - 10.1002/vms3.893 [doi]
AB  - With the aging of pet dogs, there has been an increasing trend insenility-related diseases; additionally, cognitive disorders accompanied byabnormal behaviours are a major burden for owners. Recently, there have been aseries of consultations regarding the fact that night barking, which is anabnormal behaviour, remarkably interferes with the owner's sleep and adverselyaffects the owner's quality of life. However, there has been no effectivesolution to this problem. In this study, three aged pet dogs diagnosed withdementia were administered an equine placental extract (eqPE) as pet supplement, which has been shown in laboratory models to improve cognitive function.Consequently, night barking ceased 1 week after the administration of eqPE incase 2 and it was observed to decrease in the other two dogs. Furthermore, night barking disappeared 2 and 3 weeks after the administration of eqPE in cases 1 and3, respectively. No recurrence or exacerbation of night barking was observed inthe three cases treated with the eqPE, and no adverse events were observed. Theseresults suggest that eqPE may be useful for improving night barking in pet dogswith dementia, and it is expected to be a new treatment method.

AB  - Objective: To assess knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of veterinarypersonnel and pet owners regarding ticks and tick-borne diseases in Alaska and toconduct a serosurvey for tick-borne disease pathogens among domestic animalsvisiting veterinary clinics for preventative care. Sample: Across 8 veterinaryclinics, we sampled 31 veterinary personnel, 81 pet owners, 102 client-owneddogs, and 1 client-owned cat. Procedures: Information on KAP among veterinarystaff and pet owners was collected via self-administered questionnaires. Tick andtick-borne disease prevalence were assessed via tick checks and benchtop ELISAantibody tests detecting Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Anaplasma platys, Erlichiacanis, Erlichia ewingii, and Borrelia burgdorferi. Results: The veterinarypersonnel KAP survey showed a low average knowledge score (53.5%) but a moderate attitude score (71.7%). In contrast, owner average knowledge score was higher(67.5%) and attitude score was comparatively low (50.6%). Both veterinarypersonnel and owners had low average practice scores (64.5% and 56.3%,respectively). One dog was positive for anaplasmosis (unknown species) antibody, and 1 dog was positive for B burgdorferi antibody. No ticks were found during thestudy. Clinical Relevance: This study was the first of its kind in the state and indicated a low prevalence of ticks and tick-borne diseases in the domestic petpopulation and highlighted significant knowledge gaps that could be targeted bypublic health efforts. Our results suggest the value of a One Health approach andof the veterinary-client relationship to address ticks and tick-borne diseases.

TI  - Perception of canine rabies among pupils under 15 years in Kwara State, NorthCentral Nigeria.
PG  - e0010614
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010614 [doi]
AB  - Rabies is an endemic, highly fatal, and vaccine-preventable disease with severesocio-economic implications. Most (99%) human rabies cases are transmittedthrough dog bites. Children under 15 years account for 40% of all dog bitevictims and 35-50% of all rabies deaths. Rabies awareness among this vulnerablegroup is critical to rabies prevention. However, there is a paucity of data onrabies awareness among pupils under 15. Hence, this study assessed the awareness and attitude of pupils under 15 years towards canine rabies in Kwara state inNigeria. The study was conducted as a cross-sectional survey of 1,388 pupilsacross the state using a structured questionnaire that was administered as aone-on-one interview using the Open Data Kit on Android phones in December 2019. Of the 1388 pupils included in this study, only 21.7% (n = 301) of them wereaware of rabies. The mean rabies score was 1.7+/-0.8 and only 29.2% (n = 88/301) of the pupils had adequate knowledge of canine rabies. The dog ownership rate was18.7% (n = 259) with an average of 1.93 dogs per household. Approximately 5% (n =66) of the pupils have been previously bitten by a dog. One-third of the dog bitevictims (35%, n = 23/66) were managed and treated at home and only 12% (n = 8/66)were treated in a health facility. The result of the multivariable logisticregression showed that students aged between 13-15 years were more likely (OR:1.93; 95% CI: 0.72-3.01; p < 0.001) to have adequate knowledge of rabies than theyounger pupils. Similarly, pupils that have dogs in their households (OR: 2.09;95%CI: 1.49-2.75; p < 0.001) and those that reside in Kwara South (OR:1.78 95%CI:1.29, 2.44; p < 0.001) were more likely to be aware and have adequateknowledge of canine rabies respectively. Finally, Pupils from non-dog-owninghouseholds were more likely (OR:2.2; 95% CI: 1.45, 4.42; p < 0.001) to have been bitten by dogs than those from dog-owning households. The awareness and attitude of pupils under 15 to canine rabies was poor. We advocate the introduction ofrabies lessons into the school curriculum in Kwara State to reduce the incidence of dog bites and prevent dog-mediated human rabies.

AB  - (E)-1,2-Difluoroethylene (HFO-1132E) is a colorless gas used as a refrigerant.HFO-1132E has low acute toxicity following inhalation exposure in rats and dogs. HFO-1132E caused neither cardiac sensitization in dogs nor reproductive ordevelopmental toxicity in rats following repeated inhalation exposure. Repeatedinhalation exposure for up to 13 weeks in rats resulted in degeneration of thevomeronasal organ (VNO) at all exposure levels. However, the VNO is poorlydeveloped or absent in humans. HFO-1132E was not genotoxic in either an in vitro chromosome aberration study or in vivo (rat) or in vitro micronucleus assaysalthough the substance was mutagenic in 4 of 5 Salmonella and E. coli strainswith and without S9. In an in vivo comet assay in rats, statistically significantincreases in DNA strand breaks were observed in the kidney at concentrations>/=60,000 ppm and in the liver, bladder, and lung at 120,000 ppm. An increase in hedgehog cells was also noted at these concentrations that confounded the cometresponse. The point of departure for the WEEL was 15,000 ppm from the 13-weekinhalation study. After application of appropriate adjustment factors, an 8-htime-weighted average (TWA) WEEL value of 350 ppm was derived. This exposurelimit is expected to provide a significant margin of safety against any potentialadverse health effects in workers. A short-term exposure level (STEL) or skinnotation is not applicable for this WEEL.

AB  - Canine visceral leishmaniasis is an endemic zoonosis in Brazil. Dogs are the mainhosts in urban environments. The treatment has gained popularity since theBrazilian government authorized miltefosine for canine treatment. The aim of thisstudy was to investigate the clinical and parasitological impact of short-termtreatment with miltefosine and allopurinol, alone and in combination. Weevaluated the ability of pharmacotherapy to reduce clinical signs of disease,antibody levels using the indirect fluorescence antibody test (IFAT) and skinparasite load via qPCR after 28 days of treatment. The therapeutic protocolspromoted a significant decline in clinical signs and in the skin parasite load indogs (p < 0.01). We observed a moderate correlation between the skin parasiteload and the clinical score in all three treatment groups (r > 0.5) Antibodylevels did not decrease in this short period. It was concluded that the treatmentwith allopurinol reduced the number of parasites in the skin of dogs withvisceral leishmaniasis in the short term. However, its efficiency is potentiated when associated with miltefosine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although there are growing demands for stem cell-based therapy forcompanion animals in various diseases, a few clinical trials have been reported. Moreover, most of them are the results from only one or a few times of stem cell injection. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to describe a long-term treatmentwith allogeneic adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) in a dog with rheumatoidarthritis (RA), which is a rare canine disease. METHODS: The dog with RA receivedintravascular injection of allogeneic ASCs derived from two healthy donors once amonth for 11 months. To assess therapeutic effects of ASCs, orthopedicexamination and clinical evaluation was performed. Cytokines of tumor necrosisfactor-alpha and interleukin-6 in the plasma were measured using ELISA analysis. RESULTS: Despite this repeated and long-term administration of allogeneic ASCs,there were no side effects such as immunorejection responses or cell toxicity.The orthopedic examination score for the dog decreased after ASCs treatment, and the clinical condition of the dog and owner's satisfaction were very good.CONCLUSIONS: Although ASCs has been suggested as one of the options for RAtreatment because of its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive functions, ithas never been used to treat RA in dogs. The present report describes a case ofcanine RA treated with allogeneic ASCs for long-term in which the dog showedclinical improvement without adverse effects.

TI  - Laryngeal silicone stent as a treatment option for laryngeal paralysis in dogs: apreliminary study of 6 cases.
PG  - e58
LID - 10.4142/jvs.22068 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Laryngeal paralysis is a common idiopathic degenerative neurological disease in older medium-to-large breed dogs, with surgical correction of theobstruction being the treatment of choice. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated theuse of laryngeal silicone stents to treat canine laryngeal paralysis in dogswhere classic surgical treatment was not accepted by the owners. METHODS: Dogsdiagnosed with laryngeal paralysis, for which the owners refused arytenoidlateralization surgery as a first-line treatment, were treated with laryngealsilicone stents. RESULTS: Six dogs with bilateral laryngeal paralysis wereincluded in the study. All dogs showed improvement in clinical signs immediately after the procedure. No clinical signs or radiographic changes were noted in fourout of six dogs in the follow-up visit performed 1 wk later. One dog wassuspected of aspirating water while drinking, but the signs disappeared afterrepositioning the stent. Another dog had a relapse of stridor due to caudalmigration of the stent. This dog underwent arytenoid lateralization surgerybecause larger stents are not commercially available. At the time of writing,between seven and 13 mon after stent placement, no significant incidents haveoccurred in four dogs, and all owners report a satisfactory quality of life.CONCLUSIONS: Laryngeal silicone stenting is an interesting alternative fortreating dogs with acquired laryngeal paralysis when the owners refuse classicarytenoid lateralization surgery. Furthermore, stent placement can be a temporarysolution to stabilize these dogs until a permanent surgical treatment can beperformed.

LID - 10.30466/vrf.2021.134713.3019 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to introduce a new animal model of fecal incontinence(FI) by injecting abobotulinumtoxinA in the external anal sphincter (EAS) muscle of dogs which replaces models based on anal sphincter destructions that areinvasive, mostly require surgical procedures, expensive, permanent, and painfulto the animals. 4 healthy mongrel dogs were used in this study. First, they were received NaCl 0.09% (as control) injections in EAS muscle and effects wereassessed by means of Electromyography (EMG) and clinically evaluated by sphincterpinch test and presence of leakage of feces for 2 weeks. Then, they receivedabobotulinumtoxinA in EAS muscle and reevaluated for 6 weeks to see short-termand medium-term effects of abobotulinumtoxinA injection. Saline had nosignificant changes in results obtained from EMG, however, there were significantdecreases in amplitudes of action potentials after receiving abobotulinumtoxinAin comparison with no injection or saline injection in EAS muscle. Pinch testswere normal after saline injection assessment period, however, then started to benegative, ranging from two days after abobotulinumtoxinA injection to seven days after receiving abobotulinumtoxinA. Animals also had significant presentations offecal incontinence (leakage of feces and cage contamination with feces) from the 1(st) week after receiving abobotulinumtoxinA until the 6(th) week afterreceiving abobotulinumtoxinA. AbobotulinumtoxinA caused paralysis in the EAS and producd FI conditions in dogs. This animal model was an appropriate substitute tothe various invasive, expensive and also complicated procedures with an easy,feasible, noninvasive and non-painful single-stage abobotulinumtoxinA injection.

AB  - Otitis externa is an inflammatory disease of the external ear canal; atherapeutic alternative is the controlled-flux electrolyzed acidic solution(SAEFC) with bactericidal and bacteriostatic properties. The purpose of thisstudy was to evaluate the clinical and cytological efficacies of SAEFC in otitis externa. A total of 30 dogs were examined. The clinical and cytologicalevaluations were on days 1, 7 and 14; the following was considered: Pain,erythema, exudate, inflammation, ulcers, putrid odor and pigmentation.Cytological evaluations were carried out to examine the presence ofpolymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), intra-cellular bacteria (cocci; IC),extra-cellular bacteria (EC) and yeasts on days 1, 7 and 14. A cotton swabsaturated with SAEFC was applied for each dog's ear. The values of PMN diminishedhaving a significant difference between days. The presence of IC (cocci) had adifference in evaluations from day 1 to day 7 and from day 7 to day 14demonstrating an important drop. The evaluation of pain showed a sustaineddecrease until reaching 95.00% of remission, erythema diminished 68.33%, theexudate dropped to 90.00%, inflammation was no longer present by day 14 in 78.00%of the cases and 21.67% showed a slight inflammation, the putrid odor dropped to 95.00% and 5.00% presented a mild odor and by day 14 ear pigmentation was nolonger present in 51.67% of the cases and the 48.33% had slight pigmentation. Theuse of SAEFC is an effective alternative treatment in dogs with otitis externa.

AB  - Bone-marrow derived stem cells (BMSCs) can differentiate into several mesenchymalcell lines that are suitable for bone and dental tissue engineering. This studywas aimed to assess the efficacy of cell therapy in direct pulp capping (DPC) of canine teeth using autologous BMSCs along with collagen/hydroxyapatite hybridscaffold in terms of the quantity and quality of calcified bridge formation. The teeth were randomly divided into three groups of DPC with mineral trioxideaggregate (MTA), hydroxyapatite/collagen hybrid scaffold alone and BMSCs withhydroxyapatite/collagen hybrid scaffold. DPC was performed under generalanesthesia in cavities prepared on the buccal surfaces of mandibular andmaxillary premolars of the same dogs from which, stem cells had been isolated.All cavities were then restored with light-cure resin modified glass ionomercement. Histomorphometric assessments after 12 weeks showed formation of dentinalbridge following DPC with BMSCs and MTA. The efficacy of MTA for calcified bridgeformation following DPC was significantly higher than that of BMSCs plus hybridscaffold. According to the present study, we concluded DPC using BMSCs and hybridscaffold did not provide clinically noticeable results in canine patients.

TI  - Cervical tracheal rupture with persistence of a pseudotrachea in a dog.
PG  - 830-834
AB  - A dog was examined because of acute onset of respiratory distress following acervical dog bite. Physical examination revealed a deep ventral cervical bitewound associated with localized mild subcutaneous emphysema. Thoracic radiographsshowed moderate pneumomediastinum. Medical management consisting of oxygentherapy, antibiotics, and anti-inflammatories was initiated. After 2 days,respiratory distress suddenly worsened. Tracheoscopy showed a discontinuitybetween the tracheal rings of the cervical trachea; however, the inner trachealwall appeared intact. Computed tomography scan revealed a ~3-cm complete rupture of all layers of the trachea. Surgical resection and anastomosis of the tracheawere performed successfully. Follow-up 15 days after surgery showed completeresolution of respiratory signs, as well as subcutaneous emphysema. A mildventral angulation of the trachea at the surgical site was noticed on thoracicradiographs. This is the first case report of a pseudotrachea in a dog.Persistence of a pseudotrachea may initially result in only minor clinical signs responsive to medical therapy despite tracheal rupture. In the presence of apseudotrachea, tracheal rupture may be difficult to identify with tracheoscopyalone. Therefore, CT scan should be proposed in every patient with suspectedtracheal trauma. Key clinical message: This case report highlights the importanceof including a tracheal rupture in the differential diagnosis of cervicalsubcutaneous emphysema, even if the amount is small and not associated withsignificant respiratory signs. The presence of a pseudotrachea may result in lesssevere clinical signs than expected based on the actual degree of trachealinjury; however, the clinical status may rapidly deteriorate and becomelife-threatening. This case report also underlines the importance of a CT scan asa complement to tracheoscopy, which may not be sufficient to identify a tracheal rupture in the presence of a pseudotrachea.

TI  - Glossitis in an older non-corgi dog: Diagnosis and long-term follow-up.
PG  - 825-829
AB  - A 9-year-old spayed female 18.8 kg mixed breed boxer dog was referred forevaluation of a 7-month history of difficulty swallowing and prehending food,regurgitation, hypersalivation, and an abnormal dorsiflexion of the tongue. Priorto referral, a barium study was performed, which revealed a mildly dilatedesophagus. Treatment with sucralfate, cisapride, and prednisone was initiated.Physical examination revealed bilateral, symmetric atrophy of the temporalismuscles, dorsiflexion of the distal aspect of the tongue with concurrent muscleatrophy, and a reduced gag reflex. Electrodiagnostic examinations revealedspontaneous electrical activity in the muscles of mastication and tongue.Biopsies from the right temporalis, tongue, and biceps femoris muscles werecollected. An immune-mediated myositis with fibrosis, scattered CD3, CD4, andCD8+ T-lymphocytes, and upregulation of markers for major histocompatibilityantigens were observed in the tongue and temporalis muscles. The dog was treated with a tapering course of prednisone over 2 months and cyclosporine long-term.The dog was maintained on cyclosporine alone for > 2 years and clinical signsremained static, although multiple episodes of aspiration pneumonia occurred.Ultimately, euthanasia was performed due to chronic kidney disease withassociated anemia, lethargy, and anorexia.

PG  - 855-858
AB  - A 1-year-old male golden retriever-poodle crossbred dog was brought to aveterinary clinic with a 1-month travel history to Muskoka, Ontario and a 1-week history of left eye irritation and ocular discharge. Ophthalmic examination andblood analysis revealed bilateral uveitis with a normal complete blood (cell)count and biochemistry panel. Symptomatic treatment was administered with noimprovement observed and the dog returned 2 weeks later for assessment of adraining swelling of the left hind 4th digit. Clinical examination of thoracicradiographs and abdominal ultrasound showed evidence of disseminatedblastomycosis characterized by pulmonary lesions, and multifocal lymphadenopathy.Biopsy of the draining lesion and cytological examination of an enlarged lymphnode established diagnosis. The dog was started on a standard antifungaltreatment protocol (itraconazole) but returned after 11 d of treatment withneurological signs including ataxia, paraparesis, left head tilt, and compulsive turning. Humane euthanasia was chosen and the diagnosis was confirmed atpostmortem examination.

TI  - Gastroesophageal intussusception in a 4-week-old German shepherd puppy.
PG  - 841-844
AB  - The surgical treatment of a gastroesophageal intussusception (GEI) in a4-week-old male intact German shepherd puppy is described in this report.Bilateral gastropexies were performed; an incisional gastropexy on the right and a gastrostomy tube gastropexy on the left. The dog recovered well and is thrivinglong-term with no clinical signs of persistent megaesophagus. With thecombination of early detection and surgical correction of GEI, mortality ratesmay be lower than the 95% mortality rate that has been reported in previousliterature and supports new studies that have reported a 65% survival ratelong-term. Key clinical message: Young animals presenting with vague clinicalsigns require thorough evaluation to identify uncommon, yet life-threateningdiseases such as GEI. Early detection and interventions can subsequently lead to successful outcomes.

TI  - Estimation of defined daily doses of antimicrobials for dogs and cats treated forbacterial cystitis.
PG  - 851-854
AB  - Objective: To calculate prescribed daily doses (PDDs) for selected antimicrobialsand evaluate application of defined daily doses (DDDs) using an antimicrobialpurchasing dataset. Animals: Data from dogs and cats treated for bacterialcystitis at a veterinary practice network were evaluated. Procedure: A datasetcontaining antimicrobial prescriptions for dogs and cats diagnosed with bacterialcystitis was evaluated. Median dose and frequency and median weight of treatedanimals were used to calculate PDDs. To account for differences in use betweendogs and cats, an adjusted DDD was calculated based on adjustment forproportional use in dogs versus cats. Results: PDDs for dogs and cats weredetermined and adjusted DDDs were calculated and applied to an antimicrobialpurchasing dataset from 886 veterinary clinics, demonstrating the differencebetween mass-based and DDD data. Conclusions: DDDs can be estimated usingprescription datasets, accounting for differences in weights (between and within species) and relative use between dogs and cats. These can be applied to broader (sales, purchase) datasets to provide a more detailed understanding of howantimicrobials are used. Clinical relevance: DDDs could be a useful measure forassessing mass-based antimicrobial use datasets as part of antimicrobialstewardship surveillance efforts.

TI  - Multi-modality imaging and therapeutics used in a case of canine spinalnephroblastoma.
PG  - 811-818
AB  - A 4-year-old castrated male golden retriever dog was brought to a veterinaryteaching hospital for evaluation of acute progressive paraparesis. Neurologicalexamination indicated a spinal cord lesion between the third thoracic vertebraand third lumbar vertebrae. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed anintradural, extra medullary, and/or intramedullary mass centered over theeleventh and twelfth thoracic disc space. The dog underwent cytoreductive surgeryand histopathologic analysis diagnosed a nephroblastoma. Following this, the dog underwent multimodal therapy, including multiple surgeries, 2 courses ofradiation, and combination chemotherapy. The dog had serial restaging using MRI, computed tomography (CT), and fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emissiontomography/computed tomography throughout the course of therapy. The dog survived350 d from date of first presentation until humane euthanasia was elected due to worsening of neurologic status. During postmortem examination, extensiveinfiltration of the spinal cord by nephroblastoma cells was discovered as well aspulmonary metastatic disease. Key clinical message: Based on the literaturesearch, this is the first case in which surgery, radiation therapy, andchemotherapy were all used for the treatment of canine spinal nephroblastoma.This case report details the aggressive nature of a case of canine spinalnephroblastoma despite multi-modal therapy.

AB  - Transmissible venereal tumor (TVT) is a malignant round cell neoplasm thatprimarily affects the genital region of dogs. Despite being sexually transmitted,transmission can occur through contact with mucous membranes and cutaneoustissue. Although less routine, TVT has been described in several extragenitalregions, such as the nasal plane, oral cavity, eyeball, eyelid, and anus.Although metastases are infrequent, they can occur in the skin, inguinal lymphnodes, liver, kidneys, spleen, intestine, heart, brain, lungs, and other organs. The clinical signs of TVT are usually related to serosanguineous secretion,intense odor, deformity, ulceration, and possibly areas of necrosis. In cases of metastases, clinical signs will depend on the affected organ. The treatment ofchoice for TVT is chemotherapy with vincristine. The present study aimed toreport the case of a 2-year-old mixed-breed canine with intra-abdominal nodulesdetected by ultrasound examination, which were later diagnosed as a TVT byhistopathology and immunohistochemistry.

AB  - Clonality assays based on antigen receptors are used as adjunct examinations inthe diagnosis of lymphoproliferative diseases. We investigated the usefulness of the T-cell receptor beta (TRB) and T-cell receptor delta (TRD) loci in clonality assays for high-grade gastrointestinal (GI) lymphoma in dogs. For TRB, we usedprimers reported previously; for TRD, we designed primers for each of the V and Jgenes based on genomic sequences. Genomic DNA was extracted from 39formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of high-grade GI lymphoma diagnosedhistologically. The sensitivity of TRB and TRD primers for GI lymphoma was 41.0% and 38.5%, respectively, which was lower than the 82.1% sensitivity of T-cellreceptor gamma (TRG) primers However, some cases that could not be detected usingTRG primers had clonality with either TRB or TRD primers. We found the TRG locus to be more suitable as a first choice for the assay of canine lymphoma clonality than the TRB and TRD loci. However, the detection rate of T-cell clonality may beenhanced using TRB and TRD primers for lymphoma cases not detected using TRGprimers.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: While assistance dog use has received considerable recent attention, few studies have focused on benefits for older adults. The current reviewexamined effects of assistance dog acquisition across practical, mental,physical, and social wellbeing domains for older adults. Further, it comparedassistance dog types and identified potential barriers to acquisition. METHODS: Asystematic review was completed. Criteria focused on older adults with relevantdisabilities (visual/hearing impairments, and PTSD), who received support from anassistance dog (guide, hearing or other assistance dog). Identified studies (n = 2,951) were screened, 256 assessed for eligibility, and 28 included, with keyinformation extracted and summarized. RESULTS: All dog types demonstratedbenefits across all assessed domains. Disadvantages and acquisition barriers wereidentified. However, limited empirical evidence was available, and no studiesfocused exclusively on older adults, revealing the need for studies includingthis age-group. CONCLUSIONS: While results indicated support for assistance dogacquisition, disadvantages and barriers require further attention.Methodologically improved research should focus on assistance dog acquisition forolder persons. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The study indicated assistance dogacquisition could produce positive clinical impacts, including on mental healthand everyday functioning. Thus, acquisition could be considered as part amulti-faceted treatment or recommended to appropriate older adults.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of three recruitment airway pressures (RPaw) onlung aeration and volumes in mechanically ventilated dogs during propofolanesthesia. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, crossover randomized experimental study.ANIMALS: A total of eight healthy anesthetized experimental Beagle dogs in dorsalrecumbency. METHODS: Dogs were mechanically ventilated with a tidal volume of 15 mL kg(-1) and zero positive end-expiratory pressure and 100% oxygen. Threemaneuvers consisting of a 30 second inspiration at RPaws of 15 (RPaw15), 25(RPaw25) and 35 (RPaw35) cmH2O were performed randomly, 15 minutes apart. Changesin lung aeration and lung deformation were compared with end-expiratory baseline (before the application of each RPaw) and between-RPaws using computed tomographyscans and calculations of global lung strain. Between-group comparisons wereperformed with one-way anova for repeated measures followed by Tukey test formultiple comparisons. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Theamount of nonaeration was minimal (<1%) at baseline and not different with theapplication of the RPaws. The amount of hypoaeration and normoaeration duringbaseline decreased with all RPaws (p < 0.001). There was no difference betweenRPaws regarding hypoaeration (all p > 0.999), whereas normoaeration was higher atRPaw15 than RPaw25 and RPaw35 (p < 0.009). Compared with baseline, the fractionof hyperaerated alveoli increased with each RPaw (p < 0.001) and was lower duringRPaw15 than RPaw25 and RPaw35 (both p </= 0.007). Global lung strain was lowerduring RPaw15 than at higher RPaw (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICALRELEVANCE: A RPaw of 15 cmH2O for 30 seconds was the recommended RPaw because it was as effective at reversing hypoaeration as RPaws of 25 and 35 cmH2O but withless hyperaeration and potential for overdistension of the lungs in thisparticular population of dogs with negligible atelectasis.

AB  - Current management practices of pyometra in the private practice setting are not well documented. The goal of this study was to understand pyometra management in the private practice setting, and the current relationship private practices havewith high quality, high volume, spay-neuter (HQHVSN) clinics regarding referralfor pyometra surgery. An anonymous electronic survey was piloted and distributed using SurveyMonkey via email, social media, and the Independent VeterinaryPractitioners Association targeting veterinarians who see companion animals. Atotal of 153 responses were received from June-July 2021, with respondentsdistributed throughout the United States. Practices performed a median of 10 spayand neuters per week, with the median spay cost being $350 (IQR 250-500) for dogsand $250 (IQR 180-350) for cats. The median cost of a pyometra surgery was $1000 (IQR 700-1500) for dogs and $750 (IQR 450-1000) for cats. All practices treatedpyometra at least sometimes, despite the disruption (major 19%, moderate 47%,mild 29%, none 5%) to their day. All pyometra presentations were accepted fortreatment at least sometimes: BAR/QAR (98%), depressed or non-ambulatory (88%),and obtunded or lateral (62%) with mean estimated survival of 96%, 74%, and 31%, respectively. The majority (56%) of clients were reported to sometimes havetrouble paying for all recommended services, while it was less often reportedthat clients often (31%) or rarely (13%) had trouble. Private practices willingto refer only did so always 20% of the time and sometimes 36% of the time.Private practices will do what they can to treat most pyometras that present attheir practice within a timely manner before referring elsewhere. There iscurrently inconsistent utilization of HQHVSN clinics as a potential referralresource due to location or appointment availability.

AB  - Significant improvement in thiamin retention of canned cat food has not beenachieved by altering processing conditions. Some ingredients, such as yeasts, maysupply thiamin able to withstand thermal processing. Therefore, the studyobjective was to evaluate yeast ingredients as thiamin sources for canned catfood. Six yeast ingredients were screened for thiamin content, and values ranged from 9.9-4,283.8 mg/kg dry matter basis (DMB). Treatments for thermal processing were arranged as a 2x4 factorial with 2 levels of vitamin premix (with orwithout) and 4 yeast ingredients (NY = none and LBV, BY, or EA from theingredient screening). Replicates (n = 3) were processed in a horizontal stillretort to an average lethality of 79.23 minutes. Thiamin degradation was analyzedas a mixed model with pre-retort thiamin content as a covariate and productionday as a random effect. Main effects of vitamin premix and yeast and theirinteraction were significant at P-values less than 0.05. The Fisher's LSD posthoc comparison test was used to separate means. On average, experimental formulasretained 33.75% thiamin. The main effect of vitamin premix (average -42.9 mg/kgDMB) was not significant (P > 0.05). Thiamin degradation between NY (-31.3 mg/kg DMB) and BY (-33.8 mg/kg DMB) was similar (P > 0.05) whereas EA (-40.5 mg/kg DMB)and LBV (-55.6 mg/kg DMB) lost more (P < 0.05) thiamin than NY. The experimental formula of EA with vitamin premix (-70.3 mg/kg DMB) lost more (P < 0.05) thiamin than no yeast, BY, or EA without vitamin premix (average -17.4 mg/kg DMB) and allothers (average -57.3 mg/kg DMB) were intermediate (P > 0.05). In summary,thiamin from yeast ingredients didn't exhibit better thermal stability thanthiamin mononitrate. However, those ingredients with similar degradation levelsor uniquely high thiamin levels may provide added value.

TI  - Anatomic study of the canine bronchial tree using silicone casts, radiography,and CT.
LID - 10.1111/vru.13141 [doi]
AB  - This prospective anatomic study examined the canine lower airway lumen morphologyby visual inspection, radiography, and CT of silicone casts of two dogs. Studyresults showed the lobar, bronchopulmonary segmental, and pulmonary lobularorganization of the lungs grossly reflected in the hierarchically clusteredbranching structure of the bronchial tree. Study results also provided a basisfor differentiating bronchial and bronchiolar patterns. Whereas images ofsilicone-filled bronchial lumens produced large-diameter, branching, taperingbands that radiated from the lung hilus, the pattern was different for smallairways. Images of silicone-filled bronchiole lumens produced small-diameter,branching, tapering, nonradiating lines that created a speckled patternresembling micronodules and, unexpectedly during radiography, small-diameterrings with air-filled lumens attributed to positive and negative summationshadows. Consequently, imaging patterns in dogs might be affected by pulmonarylobular morphology and might differentiate large and small airway diseases.

TI  - Closed reduction and fluoroscopic-guided percutaneous pinning of femoral capital physeal or neck fractures: Thirteen fractures in 11 dogs.
LID - 10.1111/vsu.13867 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To report the short-term clinical outcome and complications in dogsthat underwent surgical repair of femoral capital physeal or neck fractures viafluoroscopic-guided percutaneous pinning (FGPP). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective caseseries. ANIMALS: Client owned dogs (n = 11) with femoral capital physeal or neck fractures (n = 13). METHODS: Records (July 2018-July 2021) of dogs that underwentsurgery for femoral capital physeal or neck fracture repair with FGPP from twohospitals were reviewed. Data collected included signalment, age, weight,preoperative lameness severity, fracture factors (etiology, Salter-Harrisclassification, time from injury to surgery, radiographic displacement), surgicalfactors (surgery time, number/size of implants, reduction quality) and outcome(follow-up examination findings, radiographic findings, complications). RESULTS: Most fractures (11/13) occurred secondary to trauma. The median time from injury to surgery was 5.5 days. There was mild radiographic displacement preoperatively in 10/13 fractures. Satisfactory fracture healing and limb function was achieved in 10/13 femurs. Complications occurred in 5/11 cases and includedintra-articular implants, implant failure/nonunion, implant migration (2), andmalunion. Of these five complications, two resolved with implant removal, and asalvage procedure was recommended in the remaining cases. Of the three casesrequiring salvage procedures, two originally presented with radiographic evidenceof fracture chronicity. CONCLUSIONS: FGPP can be used to successfully treatfemoral head and neck fractures with appropriate case selection and precisesurgical technique.

TI  - Distal renal tubular acidosis and lethargy associated with zonisamide treatmentin a dog with idiopathic epilepsy.
LID - 10.1002/vms3.905 [doi]
AB  - A 3-year-old neutered male golden retriever administered zonisamide for thetreatment of seizures showed lethargy and had normal anion gap metabolic acidosiswith hypokalaemia, hyperchloremia, and alkaline urine. The serum zonisamideconcentration was close to the upper limit, which raised a suspicion of adverseeffects of zonisamide. This is the first report showing that the fractionalexcretion of bicarbonate after compensation for the plasma bicarbonateconcentration by a sodium bicarbonate infusion was approximately 5%, indicatingdistal renal tubular acidosis (RTA). The serum zonisamide concentrationdecreased, and adverse effects were abated by reducing the zonisamide dosage.Diagnostic therapy with bicarbonate served as a means of compensating forbicarbonate deficiency and contributed to the clinical diagnosis of the conditionin zonisamide-associated RTA in dogs.

AB  - Gingivitis is a common periodontal disease in dogs and refers to inflammation of the gingiva. Gingival Index (GI), Papillary Bleeding Index (PBI) and Plaque Index(PI) are oral indices that describe the health status of the gingiva and whichare based on human observation. Thermal changes due to inflammation are expected in gingivitis. Thermographic imaging, a wide-spread diagnostic tool in veterinaryscience, can be used for identification when there is abnormal body surfacetemperature in an area of the animal body. In this study, oral examinationresults and thermographic images obtained from 458 teeth from 16 dogs were used. Firstly, a thermal imaging procedure for diagnosis of gingival diseases of dogswas defined. Secondly, reference surface temperatures of tissues for each oralindices were determined. And thirdly, statistically significant thermaldifferences between the levels of each index was compared. The statisticalanalysis showed that there are significant thermal differences in some indexlevels and that presence or absence of plaque is an important etiologic factor inthermal examination of gingivitis. The study showed that thermographic images canbe used to determine thermal changes in oral tissues of dogs with gingivitis.

AB  - Three-dimensional (3D) printing techniques for patient-individual medicine hasfound its way into veterinary neurosurgery. Because of the high accuracy of 3Dprinted specific neurosurgical navigation devices, it seems to be a safe andreliable option to use patient-individual constructions for sampling braintissue. Due to the complexity and vulnerability of the brain a particularlyprecise and safe procedure is required. In a recent cadaver study a betteraccuracy for the 3D printed MRI-based patient individual stereotactic brainbiopsy device for dogs is determined compared to the accuracies of other biopsysystems which are currently used in veterinary medicine. This case reportdescribes the clinical use of this 3D printed MRI-based patient individual brain biopsy device for brain sampling in three dogs. The system was characterized by asimple handling. Furthermore, it was an effective and reliable tool to gaindiagnostic brain biopsy samples in dogs with no significant side effects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet has a large influence on gut microbiota diversity and function. Although previous studies have investigated the effect of dietary interventionson the gut microbiome, longitudinal changes in the gut microbiome, microbialfunctions, and metabolite profiles post dietary interventions have beenunderexplored. How long these outcomes require to reach a steady-state, how they relate to one another, and their impact on host physiological changes are largelyunknown. To address these unknowns, we collected longitudinal fecal samplesfollowing an abrupt dietary change in healthy adult beagles (n = 12, age: 5.16+/- 0.87 year, BW: 13.37 +/- 0.68 kg) using a crossover design. All dogs were feda kibble diet (control) from d1-14, and then fed that same diet supplemented withfiber (HFD) or a protein-rich canned diet (CD) from d15-27. Fresh fecal sampleswere collected on d13, 16, 20, 24, and 27 for metabolite and microbiomeassessment. Fecal microbial diversity and composition, metabolite profiles, andmicrobial functions dramatically diverged and stabilized within a few days (2 dfor metabolites; 6 d for microbiota) after dietary interventions. Fecal acetate, propionate, and total short-chain fatty acids increased after change to HFD,while fecal isobutyrate, isovalerate, total branched-chain fatty acids, phenol,and indole increased after dogs consumed CD. Relative abundance of ~ 100bacterial species mainly belonging to the Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, andActinobacteria phyla increased in HFD. These shifts in gut microbiome diversityand composition were accompanied by functional changes. Transition to HFD led to increases in the relative abundance of KEGG orthology (KO) terms related tostarch and sucrose metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis, and amino sugar andnucleotide sugar metabolism, while transition to CD resulted in increasedrelative abundance of KO terms pertaining to inositol phosphate metabolism andsulfur metabolism. Significant associations among fecal microbial taxa, KO terms,and metabolites were observed, allowing for high-accuracy prediction of dietgroup by random forest analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal sampling and amulti-modal approach to characterizing the gastrointestinal environment allowedus to demonstrate how drastically and quickly dietary changes impact the fecalmicrobiome and metabolite profiles of dogs following an abrupt dietary change andidentify key microbe-metabolite relationships that allowed for treatmentprediction.

TI  - Comparing emotion inferences from dogs (Canis familiaris), panins (Pantroglodytes/Pan paniscus), and humans (Homo sapiens) facial displays.

AB  - Human beings are highly familiar over-learnt social targets, with similarphysical facial morphology between perceiver and target. But does experience withor similarity to a social target determine whether we can accurately inferemotions from their facial displays? Here, we test this question across twostudies by having human participants infer emotions from facial displays of:dogs, a highly experienced social target but with relatively dissimilar facialmorphology; panins (chimpanzees/bonobos), inexperienced social targets, but closegenetic relatives with a more similar facial morphology; and humans. We find thatpeople are more accurate inferring emotions from facial displays of dogs comparedto panins, though they are most accurate for human faces. However, we also findan effect of emotion, such that people vary in their ability to infer differentemotional states from different species' facial displays, with anger moreaccurately inferred than happiness across species, perhaps hinting at anevolutionary bias towards detecting threat. These results not only compareemotion inferences from human and animal faces but provide initial evidence that experience with a non-human animal affects inferring emotion from facialdisplays.

TI  - Accuracy of a patient-specific 3D-printed drill guide for placement of bicorticalscrews in atlantoaxial ventral stabilization in dogs.
PG  - e0272336
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272336 [doi]
AB  - Atlantoaxial instability (AAI) in dogs refers to abnormal motion at the C1-C2articulation due to congenital or developmental anomalies. Surgical treatmentoptions for AAI include dorsal and ventral stabilization techniques. Ventralstabilization techniques commonly utilize transarticular and vertebral bodyscrews or pins. However, accurate screw insertion into the vertebrae of C1 and C2is difficult because of the narrow safety corridors. This study included 10 mixeddogs, 1 Pomeranian, and 1 Shih-Tzu cadaver. All dogs weighed <10 kg. Eachspecimen was scanned using computed tomography (CT) from the head to the 7thcervical vertebrae. This study used 12 bone models and 6 patient-specific drillguides. Bone models were made using CT images and drill guides were createdthrough a CAD (computer-aided design) program. A total of six cortical screwswere used for each specimen. Two screws were placed at each of the C1, C2cranial, and C2 caudal positions. Postoperative CT images of the cervical region were obtained. The degree of cortex breaching and angle and bicortical status of each screw was evaluated. The number of screws that did not penetrate thevertebral canal was higher in the guided group (33/36, 92%) than in the controlgroup (20/36, 56%) (P = 0.003). The screw angles were more similar to thereference angle compared to the control group. The number of bicortically appliedscrews in the control group was 28/36 (78%) compared to 34/36 (94%) in the guidedgroup. Differences between the preoperative plan and the length of the appliedscrew at the C1 and C2 caudal positions were determined by comparing the screwlengths in the guide group. The study results demonstrated that the use of apatient-specific 3D-printed drill guide for AAI ventral stabilization can improvethe accuracy of the surgery. The use of rehearsal using bone models and adrilling guide may improve screw insertion accuracy.

TI  - Evolutionary analysis of rabies virus isolates from Georgia.
LID - 10.1007/s00705-022-05550-3 [doi]
AB  - Genetic relationships between rabies virus (RABV) isolates recovered from dogs,jackals, and cattle in Georgia and their closest relatives were investigated bycomparing their nucleoprotein (N) gene sequences. Multiple isolates from dogs andcattle were found to share identical N gene sequences, indicating a risk ofdog-to-cattle rabies transmission in Georgia. Exhibiting population-selectivesweeps, expansion, and genetic recombination, evolutionary analysis of GeorgianRABV isolates (all belonging to the cosmopolitan clade) and isolates from Russia,Turkey, and elsewhere provided further evidence for coinfections with differentrabies virus strains and transborder transmission.

TI  - Comparative analysis of bilirubin glucuronidation activity in canine and humanprimary hepatocytes using a 3D culture system.
LID - 10.1007/s11626-022-00711-9 [doi]
AB  - Species differences in bilirubin glucuronidation activity are observed betweenhumans and dogs through liver microsomes and recombinantUDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1. Humans exhibit higher activity than that ofdogs. In this study, bilirubin glucuronidation activity was examined in canineand human primary hepatocyte spheroids formed using a 3D culture system. Whenspheroid development in canine and human primary hepatocytes was evaluated ondays 7 and 14 after the start of culture, canine primary hepatocyte spheroids hada more distinct spherical shape than human hepatocyte spheroids, irrespective of the culture period. Furthermore, mono- and di-glucuronide generation detected in spheroids were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in human primary hepatocytes than in canine primary hepatocytes after 24 h of incubation with bilirubin for eachculture period. These results suggest that there are species differences in thebilirubin glucuronidation activity of primary hepatocytes with spheroid formationbetween humans and dogs, with the activity being higher in humans than in dogs.

TI  - Comparison of ophthalmic loteprednol etabonate and prednisolone acetate effectson adrenocortical response to ACTH in dogs.
LID - 10.1111/vop.13017 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study served to compare the degree of adrenocortical suppression following a 2-week administration of loteprednol etabonate (LE) and prednisolone acetate (PA) ophthalmic drops. PROCEDURES: In this prospective double-maskedtriple-crossover study, 21 clinically healthy dogs were randomized to receiveloteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension 0.5%, prednisolone acetate ophthalmicsuspension 1%, or artificial tears (AT). Each group (LE, PA, and AT) received onedrop in each eye every 12 h for 2 weeks, followed by a 3-week washout periodbetween treatment blocks. ACTH stimulation tests were performed before and after each treatment block. Serum cortisol samples were drawn before and 60 min afteradministration of 1 mug/kg cosyntropin IV. Repeated-measurement ANOVA followed bya Tukey's multiple comparisons test (or a Friedman test followed by a Dunn'smultiple comparisons test) were used to compare pre- and post-treatment cortisol values between each group. A p-value of </=.05 was considered significant.RESULTS: A total of 18 dogs completed the study. Prestimulation cortisol valueswere lower in the PA group compared to the LE (p = .0106), but not AT (p = .0589)groups, and post-stimulation cortisol values were lower in the PA group thaneither LE (p = .0005) or AT (p = .0002) groups. There was no significantdifference detected in pre- or post-stimulation cortisol values after thetreatment periods between LE and AT. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the reducedsuppression of cortisol values, LE caused significantly lesshypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression than PA. A topical steroid withminimal adrenocortical suppression, such as LE, may be favorable in patientswhere systemic glucocorticoid effects should be avoided.

AB  - In contrast to dog-associated human rabies cases decline year by year due to the rabies vaccination coverage rates increase in China, ferret badger (FB, Melogale moschata)-associated human rabies cases emerged in the 1990s, and are now anincreasingly recognized problem in southeast China. To investigate epidemiology, temporal evolution dynamics, transmission characterization, and pathogenicity of FB-associated rabies viruses (RABVs), from 2008 to 2018, we collected 3,622 FBbrain samples in Jiangxi and Zhejiang Province, and detected 112 RABV isolates.Four FB-related lineages were identified by phylogenetic analysis (lineages A-D),the estimated Times to Most Recent Common Ancestor were 1941, 1990, 1937, and1997 for lineages A-D, respectively. Furthermore, although no FB-associated humanrabies case has been reported there apart from Wuyuan area, FB-RABV isolates are mainly distributed in Jiangxi Province. Pathogenicity of FB-RABVs was assessedusing peripheral inoculation in mice and in beagles with masseter muscles,mortality-rates ranging from 20 to 100% in mice and 0 to 20% in beagles in thegroups infected with the various isolates. Screening of sera from humans with FB bites and no post-exposure prophylaxis to rabies revealed that five of nine were positive for neutralizing antibodies of RABV. All the results above indicatedthat FB-RABV variants caused a lesser pathogenicity in mice, beagles, and evenhumans. Vaccination in mice suggests that inactivated vaccine or recombinantsubunit vaccine products can be used to control FB-associated rabies, however,oral vaccines for stray dogs and wildlife need to be developed and licensed inChina urgently.

AB  - Heart failure cause hypoperfusion-induced damage to abdominal organs due todecreased cardiac output (CO). Using a model dog with heart failure caused byrapid ventricular pacing (RVP), we have previously demonstrated that a decreasein CO reduces pancreatic blood flow (PBF). Furthermore, we have revealed thatpancreatic acinar cell atrophy, which is a change in the pre-stage ofpancreatitis was caused. However, the mechanism by which pancreatic acinar cellatrophy was caused in RVP dogs remains unknown. This study aimed to clarify theassociation between cardiac function, PBF, and histopathological changes inpancreatic acinar cells by administrating pimobendan, which increase CO, to RVPdogs. RVP dogs were divided into the control group (no medication, n = 5) and thepimobendan group (pimobendan at 0.25 mg/kg BID, n = 5). Non-invasive bloodpressure measurement, echocardiography, and contrast-enhanced ultrasonography forPBF measurement were performed before initiating RVP and at 4 weeks afterinitiating RVP (4 weeks). At 4 weeks, the decreases in CO, mean blood pressureand PBF due to RVP were suppressed in pimobendan group. Furthermore,histopathological examination showed no changes in pancreatic acinar cells in thepimobendan group. Overall, it was clarified that the decrease in PBF due tocardiac dysfunction was a direct cause of pancreatic acinar cell atrophy. Thissuggests that maintaining PBF is clinically important for treating dogs withheart failure. In addition, these findings offer a reliable basis for developing new therapeutic strategies for heart failure in dogs, that is, pancreaticprotection.

TI  - Sphingolipids and DHA Improve Cognitive Deficits in Aged Beagle Dogs.
PG  - 646451
LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.646451 [doi]
AB  - Canine cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS) is a disorder found in senior dogsthat is typically defined by the development of specific behavioral signs whichare attributed to pathological brain aging and no other medical causes. One wayof objectively characterizing CDS is with the use of validated neuropsychologicaltest batteries in aged Beagle dogs, which are a natural model of this condition. This study used a series of neuropsychological tests to evaluate theeffectiveness of supplementation with a novel lipid extract containing porcinebrain-derived sphingolipids (Biosfeen(R)) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) forattenuating cognitive deficits in aged Beagles. Two groups (n = 12), balanced forbaseline cognitive test performance, received a daily oral dose of either testsupplement, or placebo over a 6-month treatment phase. Cognitive function wasevaluated using the following tasks: delayed non-matching to position (DNMP),selective attention, discrimination learning retention, discrimination reversallearning, and spatial discrimination acquisition and reversal learning. Theeffect of the supplement on brain metabolism using magnetic resonancespectroscopy (MRS) was also examined. A significant decline (p = 0.02) in DNMPperformance was seen in placebo-treated dogs, but not in dogs receiving thesupplement, suggesting attenuation of working memory performance decline.Compared to placebo, the supplemented group also demonstrated significantlyimproved (p = 0.01) performance on the most difficult pattern of the spatialdiscrimination task and on reversal learning of the same pattern (p = 0.01),potentially reflecting improved spatial recognition and executive function,respectively. MRS revealed a significant increase (p = 0.048) in frontal lobeglutamate and glutamine in the treatment group compared to placebo, indicating a physiological change which may be attributed to the supplement. Decreased levels of glutamate and glutamine have been correlated with cognitive decline,suggesting the observed increase in these metabolites might be linked to thepositive cognitive effects found in the present study. Results of this studysuggest the novel lipid extract may be beneficial for counteracting age-dependentdeficits in Beagle dogs and supports further investigation into its use fortreatment of CDS. Additionally, due to parallels between canine and human aging, these results might also have applicability for the use of the supplement inhuman cognitive health.

AB  - Canine tracheal collapse is a progressive disease in small breed dogs resultingfrom chronic inflammation of the tracheal mucosal lining. Polyunsaturated fattyacid EAB-277((R)) is one of the nutraceuticals that can alleviate inflammationand oxidative stress. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a prognostic tool relatedto sympathovagal balance and oxidative stress level, which is widely used withcardiorespiratory diseases. However, the effect of EAB-277((R)) on HRV intracheal collapse dogs has rarely been investigated. In this study, 26 trachealcollapse dogs were divided into two groups. In the control group, the dogsreceived the standard treatment, whereas the dogs in the EAB-277((R)) groupreceived standard treatment combined with EAB-277((R)). After being treated for 5weeks, changes in radiographic findings, blood profiles, serum malondialdehyde,inflammatory markers, and HRV were evaluated. This study found that clinicalsigns were improved in both groups (p < 0.05). However, serum malondialdehyde(MDA), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) weredecreased only in the EAB-277((R)) group after treatment for five weeks (p <0.05) and the mean percent change of MDA, IL-6, and TNF-alpha at week fivecompared to baseline in the EAB-277((R)) group was greater than in the controlgroup (p < 0.05). Additionally, greater sympathovagal imbalance indicated bydecreased standard deviation of all normal R-R intervals (SDNN) and standarddeviation of the averaged R-R intervals for all 5-minutes segments (SDANN) wasfound in the control group at week five compared to baseline (P < 0.05), whereas EAB-277((R)) improved SDNN and SDANN and decreased low frequency/high-frequencycomponent (LF/HF ratio) after being treated for five weeks (P < 0.05). This studydemonstrates that EAB-277((R)) improves clinical signs and attenuates HRVimpairment by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation in tracheal collapsedogs.

AB  - Gut microbiota seems to interact with immune system. Canine leishmaniasispathogenesis and severity of disease lean on the host immunity, but there is noinformation in literature about gut microbiota in infected animals. Thus, thisstudy aims to compare the microbiota composition and leukocyte subset of healthy dogs with those of asymptomatic dogs exposed to Leishmania spp. and dogs withclinical leishmaniasis. Thirty-nine dogs were enrolled and grouped into threegroups: healthy, exposed asymptomatic and infected symptomatic for Leishmaniaspp. Flow cytometry on whole blood evaluated the prevalence of CD4, CD5, CD8,CD11b, CD14, and CD21 positive cells. Gut microbiota was investigated using anext generation sequencing (NGS) technique. Firmicutes resulted significantlymore abundant in the healthy dogs compared with the other two groups. Conversely,Proteobacteria were more abundant in symptomatic dogs. Even in rarest phylacomparison some significant differences were found, as well as in comparison atclasses, order, family and genus levels. The symptomatic group had lowerconcentration of all the lymphocyte classes (CD5, CD21, CD4, CD8) compared to theother groups. A lower abundance of Firmicutes is reported in literature indiseased animals compared to the healthy ones and this is in agreement with theresults of this study. Increased Proteobacteria in sick animals could suggest adysbiosis status, even without distinct gastrointestinal signs. The leukocyteclasses results indicate a decreased Th1 response in symptomatic dogs. Studiesalso investigating the cytokine response could deepen the knowledge on thepathogenesis of canine leishmaniasis.

AB  - Terrorist attacks with biological and chemical warfare agents are increasing infrequency worldwide. Additionally, hazardous chemical accidents, illicit druglaboratories and intentional poisonings are potential sites for exposure toworking dogs. Working dogs play a crucial role in law enforcement, military andsearch and rescue teams. Their intelligence, agility and strength make them idealpartners to be deployed to these natural disaster sites, terrorist attacks andindustrial accidents. This, unfortunately, leads to increasing exposure tochemical and biological weapons and other hazardous substances. First responders have little to no training in emergency care of working dogs and veterinarianshave very little training on recognition of the clinical signs of many of theseagents. In order to ensure a rapid medical response at the scene first respondersand veterinarians need a primer on these agents. Identifying a specific agentamidst the chaos of a mass casualty event is challenging. Toxidromes are aconstellation of clinical and/or laboratory findings that allow for rapididentification of the clinical signs associated with a class of toxin and havebeen helpful in human medical triage. Focusing on a class of agents rather thanon each individual toxin, allows for more expedient administration of antidotesand appropriate supportive care. This article reviews toxidromes for the mostcommon chemical weapons with a special emphasis on clinical signs that arespecific (and different) for canines as well as appropriate antidotes for workingcanines. To our knowledge, there are no publications describing toxidromes forworking dogs.

TI  - Global distribution of animal sporotrichosis: A systematic review of Sporothrixsp. identified using molecular tools.
PG  - 100140
LID - 10.1016/j.crmicr.2022.100140 [doi]
AB  - Sporotrichosis is a subcutaneous mycosis caused by thermodimorphic fungi of thegenus Sporothrix. The phenotypic and genotypic differences of the isolates withinthe genus Sporothrix have been associated with their geographic distribution,virulence capacity, or clinical manifestation of sporotrichosis. Therefore, it iscrucial to identify the causative agent of sporotrichosis. However, there are fewcase reports and studies in animals compared to those in humans, despite thesubstantial increase in the number of cases of sporotrichosis by zoonotictransmission, especially in endemic areas. Considering the epidemiologicalimportance, taxonomic evolution and worldwide distribution of these fungi in the last decade, there is interest in identifying the species of the genus Sporothrixin different regions of the world. This study aimed to analyze the geographicdistribution of animal sporotrichosis in the world, caused by pathogenic species identified by use of molecular tools. This systematic review of articles from2007 to 2021 analyzed the geographic distribution of species that causesporotrichosis in cats, dogs and other animals. It demonstrated that the mostidentified species were S. brasiliensis, isolated from cats in Brazil and S.schenckii isolated from cats in Malaysia. We show the lack of studies in globalareas and reinforce the need to use molecular tools to identify and monitorpotential pathogens.

TI  - Hepatosplenic lymphoma and visceral mast cell tumor in the liver of a dog withsynchronous and multiple primary tumors.
LID - 10.1111/vcp.13086 [doi]
AB  - An 11-year-old spayed female American Cocker Spaniel was presented with a 4-week history of anorexia and a 1-week history of abdominal distension.Clinicopathologic and imaging abnormalities included intra-abdominal hemorrhage, granular lymphocytes (GLs) in abdominal fluid smears, a splenic mass, andhepatomegaly with diffuse multiple hypoechogenic nodules. Based on the cytologic,histologic, and immunohistochemical evaluation of the spleen and liver, thediagnosis was hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) of GLs. Postoperatively, the dog was maintained in good condition with chemotherapy (ACNU [nimustine],L-asparaginase, and prednisolone). However, on day 85, ultrasound-guidedfine-needle aspiration of the liver revealed a proliferation in neoplastic mastcells not associated with the GLs. The dog was diagnosed with a visceral mastcell tumor (MCT) originating from the liver. The chemotherapy was switched tovinblastine and toceranib. The dog remained in good condition until day 141 butdied due to the progression of MCT on day 158. Liver cytology on day 155 showedno GLs, although HSTCL is thought to be resistant to chemotherapy. After thedefinitive diagnosis of HSTCL, we monitored this patient's response tochemotherapy with blood tests, including complete blood counts, ultrasoundimaging, and cytologic aspirates of liver. Although canine HSTCL has a poorprognosis, the possibility of a new neoplasm, including visceral MCT, should beconsidered. Periodic liver cytology might be worthwhile in dogs receivingchemotherapy for HSTCL.

LID - 10.7883/yoken.JJID.2022.137 [doi]
AB  - Eye (including cornea) and ear canal are major sources of Streptococcus canis in companion animal practice. We aimed to clarify genotypic and phenotypic features of the eye-origin isolates in 2021 compared to ear-origin isolates in 2021 andeye-origin isolates in 2017. Of the 102 isolates in 2021, nine eye-originisolates were enrolled, whereas twenty-one ear-origin isolates in 2021 andthirteen eye-origin isolates in 2017 were included as controls. Genotypicanalyses included virulence-associated gene (VAG; inl, sagA, slo, scp, lbp, fbp, gbp, ap1, fp1, and brp) profiling, S. canis M-like protein (SCM) allele typing,multilocus sequence typing, and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genotyping:phenotypic analyses contained hemolytic activity (HA) measurement and AMRphenotyping. There was only one 2017-eye-origin isolate with high-level HA, whilethe others showed low-level HA. We observed no association of the 2021-eye-originpopulation with detection rate of each VAG. There was no association of the2021-eye-origin population with main SCM allele 2. We found significantassociation of the 2021-eye-origin population with main clonal complex (CC) 46containing sequence type (ST) 46/ST2. There was significant association of the2021-eye-origin population with AMR phenotypes/genotypes. Our observationssuggest the unique microbiological features (CC46 having AMRphenotypes/genotypes) among the 2021-eye-origin population.

TI  - The therapeutic potential of Camel Wharton jelly mesenchymal stem cells(CWJ-MSCs) in canine chronic kidney disease model.
PG  - 387
LID - 10.1186/s13287-022-03076-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide health problem that itsincidence increases nowadays with the increase in the risk of environmentalpollution. CKD can progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) which usually ends fatally. This study aimed to examine the therapeutic potential of Camel Whartonjelly-mesenchymal stem cells (CWJ-MSCs) in chronic kidney disease model inducedin dogs. METHODS: CWJ-MSCs were injected directed to the kidney withultrasonographic guidance in dogs with 5/6 nephrectomy to evaluate itstherapeutic potency in such cases. Analysis of variance was applied in normallydistributed quantitative variables while a non-parametric Mann-Whitney test wasused for non-normally distributed quantitative variables. RESULTS: The serum ureaand creatinine in the treated group were significantly decreased transferringdogs in the treated group from stage 3 to stage 2 CKD according to the IRISstaging system. Histopathology of renal tissue revealed improving CKD lesions by increasing regeneration of degenerated tubules, maintaining the integrity ofglomeruli. New vascularization with blood vessels remodeling were commonfindings. Periodic acid Schiff stain of renal tissue showed the integrity ofrenal tubules and thickness of the glomerular basement membrane. Fibrosis ofcortex and medulla was lower in the treated group than in the CKD model asmonitored by Mallory's trichrome stain (MTC). NGAL and KIM-1 genes expressionwere decreased while VEGF and EGF genes expression were increased indicatingrenal tissue repair. CONCLUSIONS: CWJ-MSCs have a therapeutic potential in theCKD model induced in dogs.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of orally administered torasemide in healthy cats.
LID - 10.1111/jvim.16500 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In people and dogs, torasemide has higher bioavailability, longerhalf-life, and longer duration of action than equivalent doses of furosemide but data regarding pharmacological properties of torasemide in cats are limited.OBJECTIVE: To assess pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of torasemidein healthy cats, and to investigate the effects of a single administration oftorasemide on indicators of diuresis, plasma creatinine concentration, bloodpressure, electrolyte concentrations and markers of therenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). ANIMALS: Six clinically healthyadult European shorthair cats. METHODS: Randomized 4-period crossover design with3 groups and 4 treatments. Pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained using anoncompartmental analysis, and the clinically effective dose was assessed using aHill model. RESULTS: Mean absolute bioavailability was estimated at 88.1%. Meantotal body clearance was 3.64 mL/h/kg and mean terminal half-life was 12.9 hours.Urine output significantly increased after torasemide administration (P < .001). The urine sodium : potassium ratio (uNa : uK) paralleled and was statisticallycorrelated to urine output (P < .001). Administration of a single torasemide doseled to a significant dose-dependent increase in urine aldosterone : creatinineratio (uAldo : C; P < .001) and a transient decrease in plasma potassiumconcentration (P < .001) but did not affect blood pressure or plasma creatinineconcentration. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: A single torasemide doseleads to a significant increase in diuresis and renin-angiotensin-aldosteronesystem (RAAS) activation in healthy cats, with high absolute bioavailability, andwithout clinically relevant adverse effects. Pharmacokinetic parameters indicate that once daily dosing of 0.27 mg/kg may be appropriate in a clinical setting.

TI  - Application of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic concepts to the development oftreatment regimens for sporadic canine urinary tract infections: Challenges andpaths forward.
LID - 10.1111/jvp.13088 [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial efficacy can be predicted based on infection site exposure to theantimicrobial agent relative to the in vitro susceptibility of the pathogen tothat agent. When infections occur in soft tissues (e.g., muscle, blood, andligaments), exposure at the infection site is generally assumed to reflect anequilibrium between the unbound concentrations in plasma and that in theinterstitial fluids. In contrast, for sporadic urinary tract infections (UTIs) indogs and uncomplicated UTIs in humans, the primary site of infection is thebladder wall. Infection develops when bacteria invade the host bladder urothelium(specifically, the umbrella cells that form the urine-contacting layer of thestratified uroepithelium) within which these bacteria can avoid exposure to host defenses and antimicrobial agents. Traditionally, pathogen susceptibility hasbeen estimated using standardized in vitro tests that measure the minimalconcentration that will inhibit pathogen growth (MIC). When usingexposure-response relationships during drug development to explore doseoptimization, these relationships can either be based upon an assessment of acorrelation between clinical outcome, drug exposure at the infection site, andpathogen MIC, or upon benchmark exposure-response relationships (i.e.,pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic indices) typically used for the various drugclasses. When using the latter approach, it is essential that the unboundconcentrations at the infection site be considered relative to the MIC within thebiological matrix to which the pathogen will be exposed. For soft tissueinfections, this typically is the unbound plasma concentrations versus MICsdetermined in standardized media such as cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton broth,which is how many indices were originally established. However, for UTIs, it isthe unbound drug concentrations within the urine versus the MICs in the actualurine biophase that needs to be considered. The importance of these relationshipsand how they are influenced by drug resistance, resilience, and inoculum arediscussed in this review using fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams as examples.

TI  - Ondansetron in dogs with nausea associated with vestibular disease: Adouble-blinded, randomized placebo-controlled crossover study.
LID - 10.1111/jvim.16504 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nausea and emesis can be, among other signs, common manifestations ofacute vestibular system dysfunction in dogs. Currently, antiemetic drugs, such asmaropitant and metoclopramide, are used commonly, but do not appear to controlnausea. A non-placebo-controlled preliminary study suggested good efficacy of5-HT3-receptor antagonists, such as ondansetron, against nausea in dogs withvestibular syndrome. OBJECTIVES: To assess and confirm the effect of ondansetron on behavior suggestive of nausea in dogs with vestibular syndrome. ANIMALS:Fourteen dogs with vestibular syndrome and clinical signs of nausea presented to a neurology service. METHODS: Placebo-controlled, double-blinded, crossoverstudy. Behavioral assessment was performed hourly for 4 hours using anestablished numerical rating scale. The criteria salivation, lip licking,vocalization, restlessness, lethargy, and general nausea were scored. Theoccurrence of emesis was recorded. After scoring at T0 (pre-dose) and T2 (2 hourspost-dose) either ondansetron (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo was injected IV. Two hourspost-dose, treatments were switched. Blood samples were collected to measureserum arginine vasopressin (AVP) concentration, which previously has been shownto correlate with clinical signs of nausea. RESULTS: Clinical resolution ofnausea was observed 1 hour after administration of ondansetron, whereas serum AVPconcentration decreased 4 hours after ondansetron administration. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Administration of ondansetron IV is beneficial for dogs withnausea secondary to acute vestibular syndrome. Ondansetron substantially andrapidly decreased clinical signs of nausea behavior and stopped emesis.

AB  - Dogs with a naturally occurring form of hydrocephalus have an elevated transmuralvenous pressure leading to cortical vein dilatation. The purpose of this study isto discover if there is vein dilatation in childhood hydrocephalus and toestimate the pressure required to maintain any enlargement found. Children withhydrocephalus between the ages of 4 and 15 years were compared with a controlgroup. Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) and flow quantification wereperformed. The arterial inflow, sagittal sinus and straight sinus venous outflow were measured and the outflow percentages compared to the inflow were calculated.The cross-sectional area of the veins were measured. There were a total of 18children with hydrocephalus, compared to 72 age and sex matched control MRV's and22 control flow quantification studies. In hydrocephalus, the sagittal sinusvenous return was reduced by 12.9%, but the straight sinus flow was notsignificantly different. The superficial territory veins were 22% larger than thecontrols but the vein of Galen was unchanged. There is evidence of a significant increase in the superficial vein transmural pressure in childhood hydrocephalusestimated to be approximately 4 mmHg. An impedance pump model is suggested toexplain these findings.

AB  - We and other researchers have shown that companion animals (pet cats and dogs)are susceptible to natural SARS-CoV-2 infections. A recent report(1) indicatesthat pet cat can transmit SARS-CoV-2 to human via direct contact raises alegitimate concern that infected pets can pass the virus on to their human pet's owners. In this letter, we reviewed known cases of animal-to-human transmissions as well as human-to-animal transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 and assess the levels ofrisks in these scenarios.

AB  - Many cats show signs of fear and stress during veterinary examinations andprocedures, and environmental stimuli such as noise can contribute to theseresponses. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect ofbackground noise commonly heard in veterinary clinics (people talking, kenneldoors shutting, dogs barking) on behavioural and physiological responses incompanion cats. In Experiment 1, owned cats underwent a mock physical examinationin a veterinary clinic with (n=16) or without (n=16) a pre-recorded noise track. A second experiment was conducted to assess cat responses to noise outside ofhandling and a clinic environment. In Experiment 2, shelter cats were eitherexposed (n=15) or not exposed (n=15) to the same noise track while allowed freemovement in a small enclosure. Physiological and behavioural responses previouslyvalidated as negative responses in cats (e.g., indicative of fear, stress andaversion) were recorded, and outcome variables were compared between treatments. For both experiments, cats exposed to the noise track showed higher heart andrespiratory rates. Noise was not associated with behavioural changes during thephysical examination; however, cats who were freely moving showed morebehavioural signs of fear and/or stress during noise exposure compared to the no noise conditions. These results show that high levels of background noise elicit physiological stress responses in cats, while ceiling effects of the examination and exposure to the clinic environment likely prevented treatment-relatedbehavioral differences from being detected during the physical examination. It isrecommended that those working with cats in environments with high levels ofbackground noise limit cat exposure to these noises to reduce cat fear andstress.

AB  - Regenerative therapies aimed at replacing photoreceptors are a promising approachfor the treatment of otherwise incurable causes of blindness. However, suchtherapies still face significant hurdles, including the need to improvesubretinal delivery and long-term survival rate of transplanted cells, andpromote sufficient integration into the host retina. Here, we successfullydelivered in vitro-derived human photoreceptor precursor cells (PRPCs; also knownas immature photoreceptors) to the subretinal space of seven normal and threercd1/PDE6B mutant dogs with advanced inherited retinal degeneration. Notably,while these xenografts were rejected in dogs that were not immunosuppressed,transplants in most dogs receiving systemic immunosuppression survived up to 3-5 months postinjection. Moreover, differentiation of donor PRPCs intophotoreceptors with synaptic pedicle-like structures that established contactwith second-order neurons was enhanced in rcd1/PDE6B mutant dogs. Together, ourfindings set the stage for evaluating functional vision restoration followingphotoreceptor replacement in canine models of inherited retinal degeneration.

TI  - Gene expression of Nectin-4 and its clinical significance in dogs with primarylung adenocarcinoma.
LID - 10.1002/vms3.895 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Canine primary lung adenocarcinoma (CPLA) is suspected by radiographyor computed tomography; however, since there are no tumour markers, earlydiagnosis is difficult, and the prognosis is poor due to increased tumour volume.Nectin-4 has been reported to be expressed in human lung, ovarian, and pancreaticcancers and promotes tumour growth. It has been reported to be a tumour markerand prognostic factor, and oncolytic virotherapy is being investigated usingnectin-4 as a therapeutic target. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was toinvestigate the expression of Nectin-4 in CPLA and its clinical significance indogs with pulmonary adenocarcinomas. METHODS: The relationships between Nectin-4 expression and signalling, tumour volume, tumour weight, and prognosis wereanalyzed in 34 CPLA patients. RESULTS: The expression of canine Nectin-4 (highNectin-4) was found in 25 of 34 cases (73%), and Nectin-4 expression levels didnot show any significant associations with gender, body weight, and tumour stage.However, there was a significant positive correlation between Nectin-4 expressionand tumour volume (r = 0.623, p < 0.05) and tumour weight (r = 0.735, p < 0.05). Regarding prognosis, the median survival time was 427 days in high Nectin-4 casesand 420 days in cases with no Nectin-4 expression. CONCLUSION: Our studydemonstrated that Nectin-4 is highly expressed in CPLA. In addition, nectin-4might be a tumour growth factor in CPLA and thus is a promising biomarker forCPLA. Further investigations on nectin-4 in CPLA are warranted for its diagnosis and novel targets for oncolytic virotherapy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of bronchial wall thickening (BWT) andcollapse in brachycephalic dogs with and without brachycephalic obstructiveairway syndrome (BOAS) and in nonbrachycephalic dogs. ANIMALS: 85 dogs with nohistory of lower respiratory tract disease that underwent CT of the thorax.PROCEDURES: Electronical medical records for March 2011 through August 2019 were reviewed to identify brachycephalic dogs with BOAS (BOAS group) andbrachycephalic dogs without BOAS (BDWB group) that did not have any evidence oflower respiratory tract disease and had undergone thoracic CT. A population ofnonbrachycephalic dogs of similar weight (control dogs) was also retrospectively recruited. RESULTS: BWT was identified in 28 of 30 (93.3%; 95% CI, 80.3% to98.6%) dogs in the BOAS group, 15 of 26 (57.7%; 95% CI, 38.7% to 75.0%) dogs inthe BDWB group, and 10 of 28 (35.7%; 95% CI, 20.1% to 54.2%) control dogs. Onmultivariable analysis, only brachycephalic conformation (P < 0.01) and bodyweight (P = 0.02) were significantly associated with the presence of BWT.Bronchial collapse was identified in 17 of 30 (56.7%; 95% CI, 39.0% to 73.1%)dogs in the BOAS group, 17 of 26 (65.4%; 95% CI, 46.3% to 81.3%) dogs in the BDWBgroup, and 3 of 28 (10.7%; 95% CI, 3.1% to 25.9%) control dogs. On multivariable analysis, only brachycephalic conformation was significantly (P < 0.01)associated with the presence of bronchial collapse. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Arelationship between brachycephalic conformation and body weight with BWT wasestablished, with heavier dogs having thicker bronchial walls. However, furtherstudies are required to investigate the cause. Bronchial collapse was also morecommon in dogs with brachycephalic conformation, which is in agreement with thepreviously published literature.

TI  - Stereotactic radiotherapy (10 Gy X 3) for canine nonlymphomatous intranasaltumors is associated with prolonged survival and minimal risk of severeradiotoxicity.
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.2460/javma.22.03.0141 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe oncologic outcomes following administration of a uniformstereotactic radiotherapy protocol (SRT; 10 Gy X 3) for canine intranasal tumors and to identify whether any clinical or dosimetric factors were predictive ofevent-free or overall survival time (EFST or OST). ANIMALS: 129 dogs. PROCEDURES:In this single-institution retrospective study, the medical records database was searched for canine nonlymphomatous intranasal tumors treated with 10 Gy X 3 SRT between August 2013 and November 2020. Findings regarding adverse effects andoutcomes were analyzed overall, for dogs grouped on the basis of life stage(mature adult, senior, or end of life), and for treatment-related ortumor-related variables to identify potential predictors of outcome. RESULTS:After SRT, most dogs clinically improved with minimal acute radiotoxicity. Themedian EFST was 237 days; median OST was 542 days. Receipt of othertumor-directed therapies before or after SRT was associated with improved EFST insenior dogs (hazard ratio [HR], 0.416) and improved OST in mature adult (HR,0.241) and senior dogs (HR, 0.348). In senior dogs, administration of highernear-minimum radiation doses was associated with improved EFST (HR, 0.686) andOST (HR, 0.743). In senior dogs, chondrosarcoma was associated with shorter OST(HR, 7.232), and in dogs at end of life, having a squamous cell or transitionalcarcinoma was associated with worse EFST (HR, 6.462). CLINICAL RELEVANCE: ThisSRT protocol results in improved quality of life and prolonged OST for dogs ofall life stages. Radiation protocol optimization or use of multimodal therapy mayfurther improve outcomes.

TI  - Early career clinicians euthanize more dogs with nontraumatic hemoabdomen but notgastric dilatation and volvulus than more experienced clinicians.
PG  - 1-4
LID - 10.2460/javma.22.05.0198 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if clinician experience influenced the euthanasia rate in2 common surgical emergencies. ANIMALS: 142 dogs with nontraumatic hemoabdomen(NTH) due to suspected ruptured splenic mass and 99 dogs with gastricdilatation-volvulus (GDV) where the owner either elected surgery or euthanasia.PROCEDURES: Medical records were reviewed for dogs that had either NTH or GDV.For each patient, the owner's decision to pursue euthanasia versus surgery wasrecorded. The primary clinician was categorized as an intern, defined as aclinician with < 12 months experience, or a non-intern, defined as a clinicianwith more than 12 months experience. The euthanasia rates were compared used aFisher exact, and the 95% CI was calculated for the risk of euthanasia if theprimary clinician was an intern compared with a non-intern. If a difference wasidentified, subgroups comparing time of day, referral status, age, Hct, totalsolids, lactate, and heart rate were evaluated using a t test with a Bonferronicorrection for the continuous variables and a Fisher exact for categoricalvariables. RESULTS: For dogs with NTH, the euthanasia rate for cases primarilymanaged by non-interns (52%) was significantly lower than that of interns (76%; P= .005). The relative risk of euthanasia associated with NTH when the case wastreated by an intern was 1.44 with a 95% CI of 1.1229 to 1.8567. For 99 dogs withGDV, the rate of euthanasia was not different between interns and non-interns.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The euthanasia rate for dogs with NTH may be impacted by the level of experience of the clinician. Support of new clinicians duringchallenging conversations should be provided.

LID - ajvr.22.05.0076 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether cardiac MRI or various biomarkers can be used todetect myocardial ischemia and fibrosis in dogs with cardiomegaly secondary tomyxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). ANIMALS: 6 dogs with cardiomegalysecondary to naturally occurring stage B2 MMVD being treated only with pimobendanwith or without enalapril and 6 control dogs with no cardiac disease. All dogswere >/= 5 years old with no systemic illness. PROCEDURES: Serum cardiac troponinI and concentrations were measured, and dogs were anesthetized for cardiac MRIwith ECG-triggered acquisition of native T1- and T2-weighted images. Gadoliniumcontrast was administered to evaluate myocardial perfusion and late gadoliniumenhancement (LGE). Mean T1 and T2 values and regions of LGE were measured withdedicated software. Extracellular volume (ECV) was estimated on the basis of Hct and T1 values of myocardium and surrounding blood. Subjective analysis formyocardial perfusion deficits was performed. RESULTS: Dogs with MMVD hadsignificantly (P = .013) higher cardiac troponin I concentrations than controldogs, but galectin-3 concentrations did not differ (P = .08) between groups.Myocardial fibrosis was detected in 4 dogs with MMVD and 3 control dogs; no dogs had obvious myocardial perfusion deficits. Native T1 and T2 values, postcontrast T1 values, and ECV values were not significantly different between groups (all P > .3). CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggest that some dogs with cardiomegalysecondary to MMVD may not have clinically relevant myocardial fibrosis.

TI  - Spatio-temporal epidemiology of animal and human rabies in northern South Africa between 1998 and 2017.
PG  - e0010464
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010464 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rabies is a fatal zoonotic disease that is maintained in domesticdogs and wildlife populations in the Republic of South Africa. A retrospectivestudy was conducted to improve understanding of the dynamics of rabies in humans,domestic dogs, and wildlife species, in relation to the ecology for threenorthern provinces of South Africa (Limpopo, Mpumalanga, and North-West) between 1998 and 2017. METHODS: A descriptive epidemiology study was conducted for human and animal rabies. Dog rabies cases were analyzed using spatio-temporal scanstatistics. The reproductive number (Rt) was estimated for the identified diseaseclusters. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the genome sequences ofrabies viruses isolated from dogs, jackals, and an African civet, and Bayesianevolutionary analysis using a strict time clock model. Several ecological andsocio-economic variables associated with dog rabies were modeled using univariateanalyses with zero-inflated negative binomial regression and multivariablespatial analyses using the integrated nested Laplace approximation for two timeperiods: 1998-2002 and 2008-2012. RESULTS: Human rabies cases increased in 2006following an increase in dog rabies cases; however, the human cases declined inthe next year while dog rabies cases fluctuated. Ten disease clusters of dograbies were identified, and utilizing the phylogenetic tree, the dynamics ofanimal rabies over 20 years was elucidated. In 2006, a virus strain thatre-emerged in eastern Limpopo Province caused the large and persistent dog rabiesoutbreaks in Limpopo and Mpumalanga Provinces. Several clusters included a rabiesvirus variant maintained in jackals in Limpopo Province, and the other variant indogs widely distributed. The widely distributed variant maintained in jackalpopulations in North-West Province caused an outbreak in dogs in 2014. The Rt washigh when the disease clusters were associated with either multiple virus strainsor multiple animal species. High-risk areas included Limpopo and MpumalangaProvinces characterized by woodlands and high temperatures and precipitation.CONCLUSION: Canine rabies was maintained mainly in dog populations but was alsoassociated with jackal species. Rural communities in Limpopo and MpumalangaProvinces were at high risk of canine rabies originating from dogs.

TI  - Assessment of corneal and limbal epithelial thickness by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography in brachycephalic and non-brachycephalic dogs.
LID - 10.1111/vop.13016 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the variance in corneal epithelial thickness (CET) and limbal epithelial thickness (LET) according to the age and skull type by usingspectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in normal dogs. ANIMALS ANDPROCEDURES: This study used an eye each from 46 dogs (24 brachycephalic and 22non-brachycephalic dogs) assessed to have clear corneas. Each dog was classified according to age into groups 1 (0-5 years), 2 (6-10 years), and 3 (>11 years).OCT imaging was performed on the central cornea for CET and perpendicular to the quadrant of the limbus for LET. The average of the maximum LET (maxLET) value wasmeasured in four eye quadrants. RESULTS: Corneal epithelial thickness was notsignificantly different according to age in brachycephalic and non-brachycephalicdogs. Visualization of the limbal invagination was better when the maxLET wasthick. Nasal and temporal maxLETs were significantly thicker than superior andinferior maxLETs in non-brachycephalic dogs. In brachycephalic dogs, there was a significant decrease in nasal maxLET with age (rs = -0.489, p = .015).Significant differences between brachycephalic and non-brachycephalic dogs wereobserved in nasal maxLET (p = .024) and temporal maxLET (p = .011). CONCLUSIONS: Invagination was better visualized in the nasal and temporal limbal quadrants of non-brachycephalic dogs compared with brachycephalic dogs, and the maxLETs of theregions were thicker than those of the brachycephalic dogs. CET and LETmeasurements using SD-OCT can help in clinical assessment and research on ocular surface diseases in dogs.

AB  - Data on the prevalence and distribution of ticks and tick-borne diseases inBelize are lacking. Ticks (n = 564) collected from dogs, horses, and vegetationin two villages in Stann Creek District in southeastern Belize in 2018, weremolecularly identified and screened for tick-borne nonviral human pathogens. The identity of 417 ticks was molecularly confirmed by DNA barcoding as Rhipicephalussanguineus (Latreille) (66.43%), Amblyomma ovale Koch (15.59%), Dermacentornitens Neumann (11.51%), Amblyomma sp. ADB0528 (3.6%), and the remainder beingsmall records (2.87%) of Amblyomma coelebs Neumann, Amblyomma imitator Kohls,Amblyomma tapirellum Dunn, Amblyomma auricularium Conil, and Amblyomma maculatum Koch. Individual tick extracts were screened for the presence of Rickettsia spp.,Babesia spp., Babesia microti, Borrelia spp., Ehrlichia spp., and Anaplasma spp. using available conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Rickettsiaparkeri strain Atlantic Rainforest was identified in five specimens of A. ovale, and one other unidentified tick, all collected from dogs. Another unidentifiedtick-also collected from a dog-tested positive for an undefined but previouslydetected Ehrlichia sp. With the exception of D. nitens, all eight other tickspecies identified in this study were collected on dogs, suggesting that dogscould be usefully employed as sentinel animals for tick surveillance in Belize.

TI  - Evaluation of symmetric dimethylarginine in cats with acute kidney injury andchronic kidney disease.
LID - 10.1111/jvim.16497 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) concentrations are considereda biomarker for renal dysfunction in dogs and humans with acute kidney injury(AKI). No studies have assessed SDMA in cats with AKI. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES:SDMA correctly identifies cats with azotemic AKI. ANIMALS: Fifteen control cats, 22 with novel AKI, 13 with acute on chronic-AKI (AoC) and 19 with chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: Retrospective study. Cats with azotemia (serum creatinineconcentrations >1.7 mg/dL) were defined as having AKI or CKD based on history,clinical signs, clinicopathological findings and diagnostic imaging, andclassified using the International Renal Interest Society (IRIS) grading/staging systems. Serum SDMA concentrations were compared between groups withnonparametric methods, and correlations assessed using Spearman's correlationcoefficient. Data are presented as median [range]. RESULTS: SDMA concentrationswere 11 (8-21) mug/dL, 36 (9-170)mug/dL, 33 (22-75) mug/dL and 25 (12-69) mug/dL in control, novel AKI, AoC and CKD cats. SDMA concentrations were significantlyhigher in cats with novel AKI (P < .001), AoC (P < .001) and CKD (P < .01)compared to controls. SDMA concentrations were significantly higher in cats with more advanced AKI (IRIS grade IV-V) compared to less severe AKI (IRIS grade II). Serum creatinine and SDMA concentrations had a significant correlation in catswith novel AKI (rs = 0.826, n = 22; P < .001) and a significant correlation when all cats across all 4 groups were considered together (rs = 0.837, n = 69; P <.001). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Serum SDMA concentrations areelevated in cats with established AKI (novel and AoC) and CKD, providing evidencefor use of SDMA as a biomarker for AKI in cats.

TI  - Determination of reference intervals for nonesterified fatty acids in the bloodserum of healthy dogs.
PG  - e40
LID - 10.1002/vro2.40 [doi]
AB  - Background: Nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) are an important energy substratein mammals. Measurement of the NEFA concentration in blood serum is commonpractice and enables reliable detection of a negative energy balance in severalspecies. This parameter can be used to detect subclinical metabolic diseases orto optimise feeding to prevent severe negative energy balance. Since no referencevalues for dogs have been published, the aim of this study was to establish such values. Methods: Blood serum from 85 healthy dogs was examined with amultiparameter clinical chemistry analyser. Given that NEFA values are notusually normally distributed, reference intervals (RIs) were calculatednonparametrically using bootstrapping (5000 replicates) for the 90% confidenceintervals. Results: The examined cohort had a median age of 62.16 months (2-180months) and a median weight of 19.2 kg (3.0-55.0 kg) and comprised 27 (31.8%)males and 58 (68.2%) females, with 32 (37.6%) neutered or spayed. The fastingtime was 5.9 h (range 0-23 h). The tested confounders age, sex, neuter status,bodyweight and body condition score did not significantly affect the NEFAconcentrations. Conclusions: The NEFA RI for dogs in this study was 0.2-1.47mmol/L. The results may be used to adjust food composition and amount in healthy dogs or to detect metabolic disorders. Further research on NEFA metabolism indogs maintained in standardised conditions and in specific nutritional situationsor with particular diseases is warranted.

PG  - 880022
LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.880022 [doi]
AB  - Orexins A (OXA) and B (OXB) and the receptors 1 (OX1R) and 2 (OX2R) for orexinsare hypothalamic peptides found in several mammalian organs and participated tothe control of a wide assortment of physiological and pathological functions. Thedistribution of OXA and OX1R has been extensively studied in the male gonad ofmammals. Here, we examined the expression and localization of OXB and OX2R aswell as their possible involvement in the regulation of testicular and epididymalfunctions, in healthy and cryptorchid dogs, employing some techniques such asimmunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and real-time RT-PCR. In vitro tests werealso carried out for evaluating the steroidogenic effect of OXB. OXB and OX2Rwere expressed in spermatocytes, spermatids, and Leydig cells in normal testis.Their localization was restricted to Sertoli and Leydig cells in cryptorchidconditions. OXB was found to be localized in all tracts of both normal andcryptorchid epididymis, whereas OX2R was found only in the caput. Because thesmall molecular weight of the peptides OXA and OXB, the expression of theirprecursor prepro-orexin (PPO), OX1R, and OX2R proteins and mRNAs wereinvestigated by means of Western blot and real-time RT-PCR analyses,respectively, in all tested groups of. In particular, the mRNA level expressionof all three genes was higher in cryptorchid dogs than in normal ones. In vitrotests demonstrated that OXB-by binding OX2R-is not involved in testicularsteroidogenic processes. Therefore, the findings of this study might be the basisfor further functional and molecular studies addressing the possible biochemical effects of OXB and OX2R in normal and pathological conditions of the malereproductive system.

AB  - A 4-year-old, female-spayed, mixed breed dog, weighing 24.2 kg, was presented foracute ingestion of ~12.3 mg/kg of Adderall XR(), an extended-release amphetamine medication. In dogs, the oral median lethal dose for amphetamines ranges anywherefrom 9-11 mg/kg to 20-27 mg/kg. On presentation, the patient was agitated,tachycardic and hypertensive. Initial treatment was instituted with intravenouslipid emulsion (IVLE) therapy, and baseline and post-treatment amphetamineconcentrations were quantified in serum and plasma. In both serum and plasma,post-IVLE concentrations of amphetamine were lower 1 h after treatment and IVLEwas the only treatment instituted during this time. The dog improvedsignificantly while in hospital and was discharged <24 h after presentation. Thisis the first known reported use of IVLE for treatment of amphetamine toxicosiswith documented decreases in both serum and plasma amphetamine levels shortlyafter administration of IVLE.

AB  - Dog boots are commonly used as protective footwear against snow, ice, hot sand,road salt, and paw injury. Only a few studies exist in veterinary medicine thatcapture the impact of dog boot replacements, such as bandages, on ground reactionforces (GRF) in dogs. To our knowledge, no studies have investigated the effectof dog boots on the center of pressure (COP) in dogs. This study investigatedchanges in the GRF of the whole limb and selected COP parameters of the pawswhile wearing dog boots in five Labrador Retrievers. After habituation, data werecollected by walking and trotting dogs over a pressure platform without boots(control measurement) and under five different test conditions (wearing boots on all limbs, boots on both front limbs, boots on both hind limbs, one boot on theleft front limb, and one boot on the right hind limb). The most prominent change was detectable when one boot was worn on the left front limb, with a decrease of peak vertical force (PFz%) in the left front limb at trot which led to asignificant difference between both front limbs and a significant increase of PFz(%) in the right hind limb. Additionally, in both tempi, the vertical impulse(IFz%) showed significant differences between the front limbs; in trot, there wasalso an increase in the right front limb compared with the control. Furthermore, some significant changes in COP parameters were detected; for instance, all test conditions showed a significant increase in COP area (%) at the right front limb during walking compared to the control. Therefore, our results show that wearing the tested dog boots in different constellations seems to have an impact on GRFand some COP parameters.

AB  - Canine mast cell tumor is a malignant neoplasm, and a gold standard treatmentremains to be determined despite the proposed chemotherapies or other therapiesin dogs. This study aimed to determine therapeutic, adverse effects and toxicity,tumor-free, and overall survival times of 10 dogs with surgically excised mastcell tumors evaluated by histopathological/immunohistochemistry and treated with four weekly intravenous administrations of 2-Aminoethyl Dihydrogen Phosphate (70 mg/kg) as adjuvant therapy. No adverse events were noted. Laboratory changes werelimited (p < 0.05) in red blood cell, hemoglobin, and platelet counts. Meantumor-free and overall survival were 599.1 +/- 469 and 755.5 +/- 423.5 days,respectively. In conclusion, 2-Aminoethyl Dihydrogen Phosphate administration wassafe in dogs. However, 2-Aminoethyl Dihydrogen Phosphate was not sufficientlyeffective to prevent a recurrence, new tumor, or metastasis of canine mast celltumors with poor immunohistochemical prognostic factors.

AB  - The addition of melatonin in seminal extenders due to its antioxidant properties and its beneficial role in sperm preservation has been previously described,especially in seasonal species. The aim of this study was to study a potentialseasonal effect based on photoperiod duration when adding a physiologicalconcentration of melatonin in the canine ejaculate. A total of 24 ejaculates wereobtained from 10 healthy dogs during the increasing photoperiod (from December 21to June 21), whereas 12 ejaculates were collected from five healthy individualsduring the decreasing photoperiod (from June 22 to December 20). Each ejaculatewas separated into two aliquots, and one of them remained as a control, whereasmelatonin (100 pM) was added to the other one (C and M treatment groups,respectively). Diluted semen was refrigerated at 5 degrees C. On days 0, 1, 2, 3,and 6, sperm motility analyses were performed using a CASA system and hypoosmoticswelling test (HOST), osmotic resistance test (ORT), and flow cytometry analysis.No effect of melatonin on motility was detected in either photoperiod. Negativeeffects of melatonin were found for acrosomal defects, apoptosis, and viabilityin the decreasing photoperiod. The addition of melatonin to sperm in thedecreasing photoperiod could create such a high level that it would cause thedescribed negative effects. We found a beneficial effect of melatonin in theincreasing photoperiod on acrosomal defects and apoptosis during 0-6 days.Melatonin treatment also increased viability in the short term (days 1 and 2) forboth photoperiods. Also, melatonin can provide certain beneficial effects onmitochondrial activity in the medium term (days 2 and 3) in the decreasingphotoperiod.

TI  - Color M-Mode Echocardiography for Non-Invasive Assessment of the IntraventricularPressure in Dogs Before and After Ductus Arteriosus Occlusion: A RetrospectiveStudy.
PG  - 908829
LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.908829 [doi]
AB  - Background: Novel non-invasive evaluation of the intraventricular pressuredifferences and gradients (IVPD and IVPG) by color M-mode echocardiography (CMME)is a promising method in diastolic function evaluation. Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a congenital heart defect which is associated with increased preload.The present work provides a clinical trial for the assessment of IVPD and IVPGchanges in dogs before and after surgical occlusion of PDA. Materials andMethods: A total of 12 client-owned dogs were enrolled in this study. PDA wasconfirmed using echocardiography, and all dogs underwent PDA occlusion.Conventional echocardiography and CMME were conducted on each patient on theoperation day (Pre-PDA) and 48 h after its occlusion (Post-PDA). The total IVPDand total IVPG, as well as segmental intraventricular pressure (basal,mid-to-apical, mid, and apical) were measured from Euler's equation usingspecific software (MATLAB). Data were analyzed for variability and for thedifference between pre- and post-PDA. The effect of PDA occlusion on the measuredvariables was calculated using biserial ranked correlation (rc). Results: Therewas a significant reduction in end-diastolic volume, fraction shortening, stroke volume, and mitral inflow velocities (early and late) after PDA closure. CMME wasfeasible in all dogs, and the CMME indices showed moderate variability, exceptfor the apical segment of IVPD and IVPG. After PDA closure, in comparison withthe pre-PDA occlusion, there was a significant reduction in total IVPD (2.285 +/-0.374 vs. 1.748 +/- 0.436 mmHg; P = 0.014), basal IVPD (1.177 +/- 0.538 vs. 0.696+/- 0.144 mmHg; P = 0.012), total IVPG (1.141 +/- 0.246 vs. 0.933 +/- 0.208 mmHg;P = 0.032), and basal IVPG (0.578 +/- 0.199 vs. 0.377 +/- 0.113 mmHg; P = 0.001);meanwhile, mid, mid-to-apical, and apical segments of both IVPD and IVPG showednon-significant difference. The magnitude of PDA occlusion on the measuredvariables was clinically relevant and associated with a large effect size ontotal and basal IVPD and IVPG (rc > 0.6). Conclusion: The current clinical study revealed matched response of IVPD and IVPG to the reduced preload rather thanleft ventricular relaxation. This result is an initial step in the clinicalutility of CMME-derived IVPD and IVPG measurements in the diastolic functionevaluation in dogs with PDA that warrants further clinical studies.

PG  - 921134
LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.921134 [doi]
AB  - Genetic predisposition of idiopathic epilepsy (IE) has been demonstrated inindividual breeds. According to the responsible breeding association in Germany, the average incidence of registered Great Swiss Mountain Dogs (GSMDs) withseizures between the years 1999 and 2019 is 2.56%, a genetic predisposition inthis breed is suspected. To describe the seizure phenotype and to examine seizurecauses, a retrospective, questionnaire-based study was performed. In cooperation with the Swiss Mountain Dog Association of Germany e.V. (SSV e.V.), 114questionnaires filled in by owners of GSMD displaying seizures and filled in bytheir respective veterinarians between the years 2005-2021 were evaluated.Seizure characteristics, clinical and further examinations, treatment, treatment responses, and pedigree information were collected. In this study, 94 (83.06%)dogs had IE (suspected genetic epilepsy) confirmed with confidence level TIER 1, 2, or 3. The remaining 20 dogs showed the signs of structural epilepsy, reactive seizures, or epilepsy of unknown cause and were therefore excluded from furtheranalysis. The average age at seizure onset was 28.83 months. Male GSMDs weresignificantly more often affected by IE than females. The most common seizuretype was focal evolving into generalized seizures (64.5%). Seizures often beganwith vomiting, retching, or salivation. Cluster seizures (CS) (48.9%) and status epilepticus (SE) (37.2%) were observed in a large proportion of dogs. During the observation time, a total of 49 animals (52.13%) died. Out of those, 19 dogs(20.21%) were euthanized in SE or during CS and 14 dogs (14.9%) diedspontaneously during CS or SE. The median age at death was 4 years, and themedian survival time for the time, when the dog was suffering from seizures, was found to be 18 months. Both occurrence of CS (p = 0.0076) and occurrence of SE (p= 0.0859) had an impact on survival time. In GSMD, idiopathic epilepsy presentswith a severe phenotype with frequently occurring CS and SE. This study couldserve as basis for further genetic evaluations as well as to provide individualtreatment recommendations.

TI  - Reprogramming adipose mesenchymal stem cells into islet beta-cells for thetreatment of canine diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 370
LID - 10.1186/s13287-022-03020-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Islet transplantation is an excellent method for the treatment oftype I diabetes mellitus. However, due to the limited number of donors,cumbersome isolation and purification procedures, and immune rejection, theclinical application is greatly limited. The development of a simple andefficient new method to obtain islet beta-cells is a key problem that urgentlyrequires a solution for the treatment of type I diabetes mellitus. METHODS: Inthis study, Pbx1, Rfx3, Pdx1, Ngn3, Pax4 and MafA were used to form a six-genecombination to efficiently reprogram aMSCs (adipose mesenchymal stem cells) into ra-betaCs (reprogrammed aMSCs-derived islet beta-cells), and the characteristics and immunogenicity of ra-betaCs were detected. Feasibility of ra-betaCstransplantation for the treatment of diabetes mellitus in model dogs and clinicaldogs was detected. RESULTS: In this study, aMSCs were efficiently reprogrammedinto ra-betaCs using a six-gene combination. The ra-betaCs showed islet beta-cellcharacteristics. The immunogenicity of ra-betaCs was detected and remained low invitro and increased after transplantation. The cotransplantation of ra-betaCs andaMSCs in the treatment of a model and clinical cases of canine diabetes mellitus achieved ideal therapeutic effects. CONCLUSIONS: The aMSCs were efficientlyreprogrammed into ra-betaCs using a six-gene combination. The cotransplantationof ra-betaCs and aMSCs as a treatment for canine diabetes is feasible, whichprovides a theoretical basis and therapeutic method for the treatment of caninediabetes.

TI  - Evidence underscoring immunological and clinical pathological changes associated with Sarcoptes scabiei infection: synthesis and meta-analysis.
PG  - 658

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sarcoptes scabiei is one of the most impactful mammalian parasites.There has been much research on immunological and clinical pathological changesassociated with S. scabiei parasitism across a range of host species. This richbody of literature is complex, and we seek to bring that complexity together inthis study. We first (1) synthesise narrative reviews of immunopathologicalrelationships to S. scabiei infection to construct overarching hypotheses; then(2) undertake a systematic meta-analysis of primary literature on immunologicaland clinical pathological changes; and lastly (3) contrast our findings from the meta-analysis to our synthesis from narrative reviews. METHODS: We synthesised 55narrative reviews into two overarching hypotheses representing type I and type IVimmune responses to S. scabiei infection. We then systematically extracted allliterature reporting immunological variables, acute phase proteins,oxidant/antioxidant status, and erythrocytic, hepatological and nephrologicalchanges, calculating 565 effect sizes between controls and sarcoptic mangeaffected groupings, refining (simplifying) hypotheses from narrative reviews.RESULTS: Immunological and clinical pathological parameters were most oftenstudied in dogs (n = 12) and humans (n = 14). Combining immunological andclinical pathological information across mammalian species (n = 19) helped yield general insights into observed disease responses. This is evidenced byinterspecific consensus in 27 immunological and clinical pathology variables(6/26 type I hypersensitivity, 3/20 type IV hypersensitivity, 6/10oxidant/antioxidant status, 3/6 acute phase protein, 4/7 erythrocytic, and 5/10hepatological/nephrological). CONCLUSIONS: Elevated IgE, eosinophils and mastcells in type I hypersensitivity response corresponded to what was described innarrative reviews. Results from type IV hypersensitivity response suggestedtypical antibody response, however cell-mediated response was less evident. Some consensus of acute phase protein response and shifted oxidant/antioxidant balanceand slight evidence of anemia. We highlight the need for mange/scabies studies tomore routinely compare immunological and clinical pathological changes againstcontrols, and include collection of a more standardised suite of variables among studies.

AB  - Dysbiosis and perturbations of fecal metabolic profiles have been reported indogs with inflammatory bowel disease. Currently the incidence of dysbiosis andthe fecal metabolomic profile in Yorkshire Terriers with chronic enteropathy(YTE) and the effects of treatment are unknown. This prospective observationalstudy analyzed the dysbiosis index (DI) and fecal bile acid, sterol and fattyacid profiles in 14 Yorkshire Terriers with active YTE, 11 dogs in clinicalremission, and 26 healthy Yorkshire Terriers. YTE was associated with dysbiosisand a significant increase in fatty acids (docosanoate, p = 0.002; gondoate, p = 0.026; erucate, p < 0.001; nervonate, p < 0.001; linolenate, p < 0.001), andplant sterols (campesterol, p < 0.001; brassicasterol, p = 0.024). The abundancesof Fusobacterium (p < 0.001) and Cl. hiranonis (p = 0.018) and the concentrationsof the secondary bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (p = 0.033) and the plant sterol sitostanol (p = 0.003) were significantly decreased compared to healthy dogs.Dysbiosis, abundances of Fusobacterium, Cl. hiranonis and fecal concentrations ofbile acids and sterols did not recover after treatment, while fecal fatty acidconcentrations decreased in treated dogs. YTE is associated with dysbiosis andchanges in bile acid, fatty acid, and sterol metabolism. These changes onlyrecovered partially despite clinical remission. They might be breed-specific and involved in the pathogenesis of YTE.

AB  - Canine hip dysplasia (HD) is a multifactorial disease caused by interactionsbetween genetic and environmental factors. HD, which mainly occurs in medium- to large-sized dogs, is a disease that causes severe pain and requires surgicalintervention. However, the procedure is not straight-forward, and the only way toameliorate the situation is to exclude individual dogs with HD from breedingprograms. Recently, prime editing (PE), a novel genome editing tool based on the CRISPR-Cas9 system, has been developed and validated in plants and mice. In this study, we successfully corrected a mutation related to HD in Labrador retrieverdogs for the first time. We collected cells from a dog diagnosed with HD,corrected the mutation using PE, and generated mutation-corrected dogs by somaticcell nuclear transfer. The results indicate that PE technology can potentially beused as a platform to correct genetic defects in dogs.

AB  - The increasing attention for the dog-owner relationship combined with advances innutrition and veterinary care have made wellbeing a focal point for dog owners,veterinarians, and dog product and service providers. While canine wellbeing can be quantified by survey-based quality of life instruments like those used inhuman healthcare, there are currently few instruments available that can do this reliably and at scale. Here we report the development and initial validation of acanine quality of life instrument specifically designed to quantify wellbeing in the general dog population. The instrument is based on a simple 32-questionsurvey and includes 5 daytime domains (energetic, mobile, relaxed, happy,sociable) and 3 mealtime domains (relaxed, interested and satisfied). It capturesspecific health-related aspects as well as more general wellbeing aspects and, inan initial sample of 2813 dogs, already provides useful insights on caninewellbeing. We believe that data collection at scale with this instrument willhelp bring optimal wellbeing to the dogs we care for.

AB  - Opioids are a key component of multimodal analgesia. Methadone is licensed inEurope for IV, IM and SC use in dogs despite there being no published studiesassessing the analgesic efficacy of SC administration. Our intention was tocompare the analgesic effect of IV or SC methadone. Fifteen dogs presenting forstifle surgery were administered 0.4mg/kg methadone IV followed by a randomised0.4mg/kg methadone IV or SC dose 3h later. All dogs received ultrasound-guidedsciatic and saphenous nerve blocks with bupivacaine prior to surgery. Thisprotocol resulted in opioid adverse effects (hypersalivation, vomiting and/orregurgitation) in 5/15 dogs (33%). Thus, in consultation with the ethical review committee, an otherwise identical protocol using a revised 0.2mg/kg methadonedose was implemented. In the next three dogs studied, similar opioid adverseeffects were found in all three dogs and the study was terminated. This paperhighlights the potential for post operative nausea and vomiting (PONV), which mayhave been induced by methadone when used in combination with efficaciouslocoregional anaesthesia.

AB  - While the symbiotic nature of human-dog relationships and perceived benefits tohuman health have attracted much scientific interest, the mechanisms throughwhich human-dog interactions may confer health benefits to humans are stillpoorly understood. The aim of this systematic literature review was to synthesizeevidence of physiological changes associated with human-dog interactions withrelevance to human health. Electronic databases were systematically searched(PubMed, MEDLINE with full text, Scopus, PsycINFO, CINAHL Plus with Full Text,and Web of Science Core Collection) for relevant studies. Of the 13,072 studiesidentified, 129 met the inclusion criteria, with approximately half beingrandomized trials (Level 2) based on the Oxford Centre for Evidence BasedMedicine level system. Measures employed to study human physiological changesassociated with human-dog interactions most commonly involved cardiac parameters and hormones, with negligible research of brain activity. The main positivefindings were increases in heart rate variability and oxytocin, and decreases in cortisol with human-dog interactions. These physiological indicators areconsistent with activation of the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) andoxytocinergic system (OTS), and down-regulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal(HPA) axis activity. These results provide evidence of specific pathways through which human-dog contact may confer health benefits, likely through relaxation,bonding, and stress reduction. However, these findings should be interpretedcontextually due to limitations and methodological differences. Previous researchusing other biological variables was limited in quantity and quality, thusimpeding firm conclusions on other possible mechanisms. Further research isneeded in some psychophysiological domains, particularly electroencephalography, to better understand central nervous system (CNS) effects. The findings of thisreview have implications for human-dog interactions to positively affect several stress-sensitive physiological pathways and thus confer health benefits. Thissupports their incorporation in various clinical, non-clinical, and researchsettings to develop evidence-based interventions and practices for cost-effectiveand efficacious ways to improve human health.

AB  - Rabies, a fatal and vaccine-preventable disease, is endemic throughout Africa. In2016, a rabies outbreak occurred in black-backed jackals (Canis mesomelas) along the western boundary of Gauteng Province, South Africa. We investigated thepossible drivers of the 2016 outbreak and established its origin. Usingspatio-temporal locations of cases, we applied logistic regression and GeographicInformation System techniques to investigate environmental covariates drivingoccurrences of emerging rabies cases in Gauteng Province. About 53.8% oflaboratory-confirmed lyssaviruses in Gauteng Province in 2016 originated fromjackals. Phylogenetic trees reconstructed from a partial region of theglycoprotein gene of these and historical rabies viruses (RABVs) demonstrated thelyssaviruses to be of canid origin with 97.7% nucleotide sequence similarity. Themajor cluster comprised jackal RABVs from the 2012 KwaZulu/Natal outbreak and the2016 outbreak in Gauteng Province. The second cluster was composed of both jackaland dog RABVs. Both clusters correlated with independent RABV introductions into Gauteng by dogs and jackals, respectively. This study demonstrated an expansionof a jackal rabies cycle from north-west Province into Gauteng Province duringthe 2016 dry period, as jackals ranged widely in search for food resourcesleading to increased jackal-dog interactions, reminiscent of the intricate links of domestic and wildlife rabies cycles in South Africa.

TI  - [Anaphylaxis due to traumatic rupture of an echinococcal cyst].
LID - D6316 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Echinococcus granulosis tapeworms' definitive hosts are dogs who livein endemic areas. Humans are infected by petting dogs or eating infected, notpropely, heated food. In multiple organs, preferably in liver and lungs, thesetapeworms can form cysts which in time might cause mechanical complications. CASEDESCRIPTION: A 7 year old Syrian boy was brought to our emergency departmentunconsciously after a light abdominal trauma. On ultrasound and CT there was nosign of traumatic injury, but a ruptured echinococcal cyst was found in theliver. The patient developed a severe anaphylaxis, with hypotension and loss ofconsciousness on the spill of the echinococcal cyst. The cyst was removedsurgically and the boy was treated with medication. CONCLUSION: In patients with unexplained anaphylaxis, from an echinococcus endemic area, rupture of anechinococcal cyst should be part of the differential diagnosis.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and anti-nausea effects of intravenous ondansetron inhospitalized dogs exhibiting clinical signs of nausea.
LID - 10.1111/jvp.13087 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of intravenous(IV) ondansetron in a population of hospitalized dogs exhibiting clinical signsof nausea. The causes of nausea included pancreatitis, gastroenteritis,endocarditis, chemotherapy-induced nausea, diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis,acute kidney injury with aspiration pneumonia, pyometra, uroabdomen, neoplasia,and hepatopathy. Twenty-four dogs were randomly assigned to one of the following IV ondansetron protocols: 1 mg/kg q12h, 0.5 mg/kg q12h, 1 mg/kg q8h, 0.5 mg/kgq8h. Serum was collected at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 h after thefirst dose, and nausea scores were recorded at multiple time points. Ondansetron and arginine vasopressin (AVP) concentrations were measured via high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry and ELISA,respectively. Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic modeling and dose intervalmodeling were performed. Ondansetron displayed linear pharmacokinetics. In the0.5 mg/kg group, mean Cmax = 214 ng/ml, AUC0-8h = 463 ng/ml*h, and calculatedhalf-life was 1.9 h. In the 1 mg/kg group, mean Cmax = 541 ng/ml, AUC0-8h = 1057 ng/ml*h and calculated half-life was 1.6 h. Serum ondansetron concentrations werenot significantly different between dogs that required rescue anti-nauseamedication (non-responders) and dogs that did not require rescue therapy(responders). In total, 83.3% of patients in the 0.5 mg/kg q8h, 0.5 mg/kg q12h,and 1 mg/kg q8h groups had improvement in nausea scores. In total, 66.7% ofpatients in the 1 mg/kg q12h group had improvement in nausea scores. In total,33% of patients had resolution of nausea in the 0.5 mg/kg q8h, 1 mg/kg q8h, and 1mg/kg q12h groups, and 16% of patients had resolution of nausea in the 0.5 mg/kg q12h group. AVP concentrations were highly variable and did not correlate withnausea scores. Nausea scores significantly decreased regardless of dosageprotocol. AVP was not a reliable biomarker of nausea in this group of dogs.

TI  - Assessing the Relationship Between Emotional States of Dogs and Their HumanHandlers, Using Simultaneous Behavioral and Cardiac Measures.
PG  - 897287
LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.897287 [doi]
AB  - Negative stress due to human handling has been reported for a number of domestic animals, including dogs. Many companion dogs display significant stress duringroutine care in the veterinary clinic, risking injury to staff and potentiallycompromising the quality of care that these dogs receive. On the other hand,positive interactions with humans can have a beneficial effect on dogs,particularly in stressful situations such as animal shelters. Research has shown that dogs can detect human emotions through visual, auditory, and chemicalchannels, and that dogs will exhibit emotional contagion, particularly withfamiliar humans. This study investigated relationships between emotional statesof dogs and unfamiliar human handlers, using simultaneous measures of cardiacactivity and behavior, during two sessions of three consecutive routine handling sets. Measures of cardiac activity included mean heart rate (HRmean), and twomeasures of heart rate variability (HRV): the root mean square of successivedifferences between normal heartbeats (RMSSD); and the high frequency absolutepower component of HRV, log transformed (HFlog). We also assessed human handlers'emotional state during handling sessions following an intervention designed toreduce stress, compared with sessions conducted on a different day and following a control activity. Polar H10 cardiac sensors were used to simultaneously record cardiac activity for both canine and human participants, and behavioral data werecollected via digital video. The strongest influence on the dogs' stress levelsin our study was found to be increasing familiarity with the setting and thehandler; HRmean and SI decreased, and HRV (as RMSSD) increased, significantlyfrom the first to the third handling set. Canine HRV (as HFlog) was also highest in set 3, although the difference was not statistically significant. There wereno strong patterns found in the human cardiac data across handling set, session, or by pre-handling activity. We did not find consistent support for emotionalcontagion between the dogs and their handlers in this study, perhaps due to thebrief time that the dogs spent with the handlers. Recommendations for applicationto dog handling, and limitations of our methods, are described.

AB  - Despite the recognized epidemiological importance of ticks as vectors forpathogens that cause numerous zoonotic and veterinary diseases, data regardingthe pathogens of pet dogs and their parasitic ticks in the Junggar Basin arescarce. In this study, a total of 178 blood samples and 436 parasitic ticks were collected from pet dogs in Junggar Basin, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region(XUAR), north-western China. All ticks were identified as Rhipicephalus turanicussensu stricto (s.s.) according to morphological and molecular characteristics.Rh. turanicus s.s. ticks were collected from pet dogs in China for the firsttime. Seven tick-borne pathogens, such as Ehrlichia chaffeensis, Anaplasmaphagocytophilum, Rickettsia massiliae, Candidatus R. barbariae, Brucella spp.,Rickettsia sibirica, and Anaplasma ovis, were detected from ticks, whereas thefirst five bacteria were detected from blood samples of dogs. Brucella spp. wasthe most predominant pathogen in both blood samples and ticks of pet dogs, withthe detection rates of 16.29 and 16.74%, respectively. Moreover, 17 ticks and 1blood sample were co-infected with two pathogens, and 1 tick was co-infected withthree pathogens. This study provided molecular evidence for the occurrence ofAnaplasma spp., Ehrlichia spp., Rickettsia spp., and Brucella spp. circulating inpet dogs and their parasitic ticks in Junggar Basin, north-western China. Thesefindings extend our knowledge of the tick-borne pathogens in pet dogs and theirparasitic ticks in Central Asia; therefore, further research on these pathogensand their role in human and animal diseases is required.

AB  - Background: Chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T) cells have transformed thetreatment of human B cell malignancies. With the advent of CAR-T therapy,specific and in some cases severe toxicities have been documented with cytokinerelease syndrome (CRS) being the most frequently reported. As dogs develop tumorsspontaneously and in an immunocompetent setting, they provide a uniquetranslational opportunity to further investigate the activity and toxicitiesassociated with CAR-T therapy. Although various adoptive cellular therapy (ACT)trials have been documented and several more are ongoing in canine oncology, CRS has not been comprehensively described in canine cancer patients. CasePresentation: Here we present the clinical and serologic changes in a dog treatedwith autologous CAR-T for relapsed B cell lymphoma that presented with lethargyand fever 3 days following CAR-T. Multiplexed serum cytokine profiling revealedincreases in key cytokines implicated in human CRS including IL-6, MCP-1,IFNgamma and IL-10 at or shortly after peak CAR-T levels in vivo. Conclusion: Theobservations noted in this case report are consistent with CRS developmentfollowing CAR-T therapy in a canine patient. The dog represents a compellingmodel to study the pathophysiology of CRS and pre-clinically screen noveltherapeutics to prevent and treat this life-threatening condition in the setting of a complex and naturally evolved immune system.

TI  - Fibronectin Modulates the Expression of miRNAs in Prostate Cancer Cell Lines.
PG  - 879997
LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.879997 [doi]
AB  - Prostate cancer (PCa) is a significant cause of cancer-related deaths among menand companion animals, such as dogs. However, despite its high mortality andincidence rates, the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease remain to befully elucidated. Among the many factors involved in prostate carcinogenesis, theextracellular matrix (ECM) plays a crucial role. This ECM in the prostate iscomposed mainly of collagen fibers, reticular fibers, elastic fibers,proteoglycans and glycoproteins, such as fibronectin. Fibronectin is aglycoprotein whose dysregulation has been implicated in the development ofmultiple types of cancer, and it has been associated with cell migration,invasion, and metastasis. Furthermore, our research group has previously shownthat fibronectin induces transcriptional changes by modulating the expression of protein coding genes in LNCaP cells. However, potential changes at thepost-transcriptional level are still not well understood. This study investigatedthe impact of exposure to fibronectin on the expression of a key class ofregulatory RNAs, the microRNAs (miRNAs), in prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and PC-3. Five mammalian miRNAs (miR-21, miR-29b, miR-125b, miR-221, and miR-222)were differentially expressed after fibronectin exposure in prostate cell lines. The expression profile of hundreds of mRNAs predicted to be targeted by thesemiRNAs was analyzed using publicly available RNA-Sequencing data (GSE64025,GSE68645, GSE29155). Also, protein-protein interaction networks and enrichmentanalysis were performed to gain insights into miRNA biological functions.Altogether, these functional analyzes revealed that fibronectin exposure impacts the expression of miRNAs potentially involved in PCa causing changes in critical signaling pathways such as PI3K-AKT, and response to cell division, death,proliferation, and migration. The relationship here demonstrated betweenfibronectin exposure and altered miRNA expression improves the comprehension ofPCa in both men and other animals, such as dogs, which naturally develop prostatecancer.

TI  - From the Balkan towards Western Europe: Range expansion of the golden jackal(Canis aureus)-A climatic niche modeling approach.
PG  - e9141
LID - 10.1002/ece3.9141 [doi]
AB  - In recent decades, a rapid range expansion of the golden jackal (Canis aureus)towards Northern and Western Europe has been observed. The golden jackal is amedium-sized canid, with a broad and flexible diet. Almost 200 different parasitespecies have been reported worldwide from C. aureus, including many parasitesthat are shared with dogs and cats and parasite species of public health concern.As parasites may follow the range shifts of their host, the range expansion ofthe golden jackal could be accompanied by changes in the parasite fauna in thenew ecosystems. In the new distribution area, the golden jackal could affectecosystem equilibrium, e.g., through changed competition situations or predation pressure. In a niche modeling approach, we project the future climatic habitatsuitability of the golden jackal in Europe in the context of whether climaticchanges promote range expansion. We use an ensemble forecast based on sixpresence-absence algorithms to estimate the climatic suitability of C. aureus fordifferent time periods up to the year 2100 considering different IPCC scenarioson future development. As predictor variables, we used six bioclimatic variables provided by worldclim. Our results clearly indicate that areas with climaticconditions analogous to those of the current core distribution area of the goldenjackal in Europe will strongly expand towards the north and the west in futuredecades. Thus, the observed range expansion may be favored by climate change. Theoccurrence of stable populations can be expected in Central Europe. With regardto biodiversity and public health concerns, the population and range dynamics of the golden jackal should be surveyed. Correlative niche models provide a usefuland frequently applied tool for this purpose. The results can help to makemonitoring more efficient by identifying areas with suitable habitat and thus ahigher probability of occurrence.

TI  - Improvement of anemia in five dogs with nonregenerative anemia treated withallogeneic adipose-derived stem cells.
PG  - 100264
LID - 10.1016/j.vas.2022.100264 [doi]
AB  - Background: Nonregenerative anemia is occasionally seen in dogs and can be causedby many factors, among which nonregenerative immune-mediated anemia (NRIMA) andpure red cell anemia are relatively common causes. These are thought to be causedby immune-mediated destruction of the erythroid lineage and are treated withimmunosuppressive drugs, but some of them are refractory or recurrent, so newtreatments are needed. Objectives: To examine the efficacy of allogeneicadipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) for the treatment of nonregerative anemia indogs. Methods: ADSCs were administered to total five nonregenerative anemiacases; two NRIMA cases and two suspected NRIMA cases that were refractory toimmunosuppressive agents, and one NRIMA case that has not been treated withimmunosuppressive agents. Results: In all cases, anemia was improved, and bloodtransfusion was no longer necessary. Conclusions: This study suggests thatallogeneic ADSCs may be one of the rescue therapies for the refractoryimmune-mediated anemia in dogs.

TI  - Adaptive Modular Convolutional Neural Network for Image Recognition.
LID - 5488 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22155488 [doi]
AB  - Image recognition has long been one of the research hotspots in computer visiontasks. The development of deep learning is rapid in recent years, andconvolutional neural networks usually need to be designed with fixed resources.If sufficient resources are available, the model can be scaled up to achievehigher accuracy, for example, VggNet, ResNet, GoogLeNet, etc. Although theaccuracy of large-scale models has been improved, the following problems willoccur with the expansion of model scale: (1) There may be over-fitting; (2)increasing model parameters; (3) slow model convergence. This paper proposes adesign method for a modular convolutional neural network model which solves theproblem of over-fitting and large model parameters by connecting multiple modulesin parallel. Moreover, each module contains several submodules (three submodules in this paper) and fuses the features extracted from the submodules. The modelconvergence can be accelerated by using the fused features (the fused featurescontain more image information). In this study, we add a gate unit based on theattention mechanism to the model, which aims to optimize the structure of themodel (select the optimal number of modules), allowing the model to select anoptimum network structure by learning and dynamically reducing FLOPs(floating-point operations per second) of the model. Compared to VggNet, ResNet, and GoogLeNet, the structure of the model proposed in this paper is simple andthe parameters are small. The proposed model achieves good results in the Kaggle datasets Cats-vs.-Dogs (99.3%), 10-Monkey Species (99.26%), and Birds-400(99.13%).

TI  - Evaluation of Water Ammonium Ion Test Kit and Its Feasibility for the Analysis ofProtein in Food.
LID - 4689 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27154689 [doi]
AB  - The traditional method for the determination of protein in food needs theoperations of digestion, distillation, absorption, and titration; therefore, itis complicated and time-consuming and requires professional personnel. Is there amore convenient and faster detection method that can directly determine theammonium ions in protein digestion solution to obtain the protein content of foodand avoid the distillation-absorption-titration process? The feasibility of waterammonium ion test kits for food protein rapid detection was discussed here. Afterdigestion, the protein in food transforms into ammonium ions in the digestionsolution. Because of the variety of food, there are many different inorganic ionsleft in the food digestion solution, and at the same time, digestion agents areadded in the digestion process and become potential interference factors inammonium determination. Therefore, the detection accuracy of ammonium test kitsneeds to be evaluated first, including their anti-interference ability. Thestandard curve of ammonium was established by the test kit. When the ammoniumconcentration was 0.00-2.50 mg/L, the absorbance at 620 nm was linearly relatedto the ammonium concentration, the determination coefficient R(2) was 0.9995, andthe detection limit of this method was 0.01 mg/L. The influences of temperature, pH value, and reaction time on the test kit method were discussed. The precision was 0.90-3.33%; the repeatability was 1.71-4.86%; and the recovery rate of tapwater, river water, and sea water was controlled within 90-103%. Theanti-interference ability of the evaluated test kit was better than that of thenational standard detection method. The test kit, combined with samplepretreatment and protein conversion formula, was used to detect protein indifferent types of food (milk powder, rice flour, wheat flour, soy, banana, milk,fish food, chicken food, and dog food). The results showed that there were nosignificant differences (rho &gt; 0.05) between the national method and the test kit method. The ammonium ion test kit method shortened the determination time andhad higher sensitivity, showing its potential for the rapid determination of foodprotein.

LID - 10.1186/s42826-022-00130-7 [doi]
AB  - Rabbits are being increasingly used as companion animals, and in research; thus, the need for proper veterinary care for rabbits has increased. Surgical access ismore challenging in rabbits under inhalation anesthesia compared to otheranimals, such as dogs and cats. Rabbits have a very narrow and deep oral cavity, large incisors, and a large tongue. Moreover, their temporomandibular joint haslimited mobility, making it more difficult to approach the larynx. Variousmethods have been proposed to overcome this difficulty. The video laryngoscopewas introduced in 1999 and is useful when airway intubation is unsuccessful usinga conventional laryngoscope. We postulated that a video laryngoscope with amodified size 1 Macintosh blade (McGrath MAC Video Laryngoscope, Medtronic, USA) would facilitate the intubation of New Zealand White rabbits. Sixteenspecific-pathogen-free male New Zealand White rabbits weighing 3.45-4.70 kg were studied. All rabbits were intubated using the video laryngoscope. Typically, a3.0 mm endotracheal tube was used for rabbits weighing < 4 kg, while a 3.5 mmtube was used in those weighing > 4 kg. During surgery, anesthesia was wellmaintained, and there were no major abnormalities in the animals' conditions. No rabbit developed breathing difficulties or anorexia after recovering fromanesthesia. We established an intubation method using a video laryngoscope with amodified blade and stylet in the supine (ventrodorsal) position and successfully applied it in 16 rabbits. It is useful for training novices and for treatingrabbits in veterinary hospitals with few staff members and animal researchfacilities where there are insufficient human resources.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of Escherichia albertii from wild and safeguarded animals in Okayama Prefecture and its prefectural borders, Japan.
LID - 10.1292/jvms.22-0213 [doi]
AB  - Escherichia albertii has recently been recognized as a zoonotic enteropathogenassociated with food-poisoning. The reservoirs and transmission routes of thisbacterium to humans are still unclear. In this study, we performed a survey of E.albertii in fecal specimens of wild and safeguarded animals in Okayama Prefectureand its prefectural borders, Japan to understand its reservoir in theenvironment. Forty-two E. albertii were isolated from 10 and 31 droppings of 59crows and 125 starlings, respectively. Fifty-two E. albertii were isolated from906 mammal droppings, and out of 52 isolates, origin of 33, 6 and 1 isolates werefrom martens, foxes, and rabbit, respectively, however, origin of 12 isolatesremained unknown. Three E. albertii were isolated from two and one feces of 159dogs and 76 cats, respectively. Pulsed-filed gel electrophoresis analysis grouped97 E. albertii strains into 66 pulsotypes including 36 and 30 pulsotypes ofisolates from mammals and birds, respectively. E. albertii strains isolated inthis study were genetically diverse. Although clonal relationship was notobserved between mammal and bird isolates, there were intra- and inter-speciesrelationship in mammalian isolates. All E. albertii strains were positive for eaeand Eacdt virulencegenes. Furthermore, 20 and 7 strains also carried Eccdt-I and stx2f genes, respectively. Taken together, the results indicate that genetically diverse and potentially virulent E. albertii are distributed among various wildand safeguarded animals in Okayama Prefecture, and the animals could also bereservoirs of E. albertii.

TI  - The Amazonian Tropical Bites Research Initiative, a hope for resolving zoonoticneglected tropical diseases in the One Health era.
LID - ihac048 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/inthealth/ihac048 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) disproportionately affectpopulations living in resource-limited settings. In the Amazon basin, substantialnumbers of NTDs are zoonotic, transmitted by vertebrate (dogs, bats, snakes) and invertebrate species (sand flies and triatomine insects). However, no dedicatedconsortia exist to find commonalities in the risk factors for or mitigationsagainst bite-associated NTDs such as rabies, snake envenoming, Chagas disease andleishmaniasis in the region. The rapid expansion of COVID-19 has further reduced resources for NTDs, exacerbated health inequality and reiterated the need toraise awareness of NTDs related to bites. METHODS: The nine countries that makeup the Amazon basin have been considered (Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador,French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Surinam and Venezuela) in the formation of a newnetwork. RESULTS: The Amazonian Tropical Bites Research Initiative (ATBRI) hasbeen created, with the aim of creating transdisciplinary solutions to the problemof animal bites leading to disease in Amazonian communities. The ATBRI seeks tounify the currently disjointed approach to the control of bite-related neglected zoonoses across Latin America. CONCLUSIONS: The coordination of different sectorsand inclusion of all stakeholders will advance this field and generate evidencefor policy-making, promoting governance and linkage across a One Health arena.

LID - ajvr.21.12.0209 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a topical sildenafil hydrogel and evaluate its effect onwound healing in dogs. ANIMALS: 6 purpose-bred, sexually intact, adult Beagles.PROCEDURES: Hydrogels containing sildenafil citrate, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone,propylene glycol, and poloxamer 407 were developed. Four excision wounds werecreated along the dorsum of the dogs. Each wound was treated for 21 days with anonadherent bandage (C) or with a hydrogel containing 0% (G), 5% (5S), or 10%(10S) sildenafil. Daily bandage changes with wound imaging were performed. Biopsyspecimens were collected 5 times. RESULTS: Hydrogels were homogenous at roomtemperature and released > 90% of the sildenafil within 8 hours in vitro. Time tofirst granulation tissue was significantly shorter for the sildenafil groups(mean +/- SD, 2.8 +/- 0.8 days [5S and 10S]), compared with the control groups(5.2 +/- 0.4 days [C] and 6.3 +/- 1.4 days [G]). The G wounds had a 10% to 14%lower contraction rate, compared with the C, 5S, and 10S wounds. 5S wounds had a total wound area 0.7 +/- 0.3 cm2 larger than 10S wounds. No significantdifferences were present when C wounds were compared with 5S and 10S wounds fortotal wound area, contraction, or epithelialization. Histologic acuteinflammatory scores were higher for 5S and 10S wounds in the early and latestages of wound healing, with higher reparative scores on day 7.Neovascularization was higher for 10S wounds on day 7 and 14. CLINICAL RELEVANCE:The topical sildenafil hydrogel promoted early granulation tissue, which may bebeneficial for secondary wound closure in clinical settings.

LID - ajvr.22.03.0036 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate photobiomodulation therapy in dogs with bilateral hiposteoarthritis. ANIMALS: 20 dogs. PROCEDURES: Forty joints were assigned to acontrol group (CG; n = 20) or treatment group (photobiomodulation therapy [PBMT];20). CG received a 21-day course of meloxicam, and PBMT received treatment with aClass IV therapeutic laser over 3 weeks. Joint range of motion, thigh girth, the Canine Brief Pain Inventory (divided into pain interference score [PIS] and pain severity score [PSS]), Hudson Visual Analogue Scale, Liverpool Osteoarthritis in Dogs, and Canine Orthopedic Index (COI; divided into function, gait, stiffness,and quality of life) were evaluated before treatment, +8, +15, +30, +60, and +90 days after initial treatment. Results were analyzed with repeated measures ANOVA or Wilcoxon signed ranks test, P < 0.05. Kaplan-Meier estimators were comparedwith the Breslow test. RESULTS: Patients had a mean age of 8.3 +/- 1.9 years and body weight of 65.7 +/- 12.1lb. Osteoarthritis was classified as moderate (n =26) and severe (14). No differences were found at time 0. Better results wereobserved in PBMT at +8 days (P = 0.01 for PSS, P = 0.04 for function and COI),+15 days (P = 0.01 for PSS and function, P = 0.02 for PIS and function, P = 0.03 for COI and P = 0.04 for Liverpool Osteoarthritis in Dogs [LOAD]) and +30 days (P= 0.01 for function and gait, P = 0.02 for COI, and P = 0.04 for PIS, PSS, andLOAD). Joint range of motion improved in PBMT from +15 to 90 days. Kaplan-Meierestimators showed that PBMT produced longer periods with better results. CLINICALRELEVANCE: PBMT reduced pain levels and improved clinical findings in dogs withhip osteoarthritis.

LID - ajvr.22.01.0007 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the duration of bupivacaine liposome suspension in the dog with that of bupivacaine and dexmedetomidine following a perineural injection.ANIMALS: 8 healthy Beagles. PROCEDURES: The left sciatic nerve of each dog wasrandomly assigned to an ultrasound-guided perineural injection with eitherbupivacaine liposome suspension (BLS) or with 0.5% bupivacaine withdexmedetomidine (1 microg/mL) (BUP-DEX). The contralateral nerve was assigned to the alternate agent. The sensory, motor, and proprioceptive functions wereevaluated before the injection (baseline) and at 4, 10, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours.RESULTS: The block in 1 limb in the BLS treatment appeared to have failed (dataset excluded). The motor scores of 2 individuals could not be evaluated leaving 5limbs to evaluate in the BLS treatment and 6 in the BUP-DEX. A total of 6 out of 7 limbs in the BLS achieved a complete sensory block. In 3 out of 5 treatmentswith BLS, motor block was only partial and in 2 not apparent at all.Proprioceptive block was partial in 5 out of 7 dogs in the BLS treatment. Allfunctions were still completely obliterated at 10 hours in 6 cases in treatmentBUP-DEX. All functions were restored in all cases by 96 and 24 hours afteradministration of BLS and BUP-DEX, respectively. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The blockadecharacteristics of bupivacaine liposome suspension were effective and longlasting. Motor and proprioceptive deficits may be inconsistent over time.

LID - ajvr.22.03.0047 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare electroretinographic (ERG) responses obtained in dogsbefore and after oral administration of gabapentin, trazodone, and a combination of both medications. ANIMALS: 12 clinically normal dogs. PROCEDURES: Ashort-protocol ERG with 20 minutes of dark adaption was recorded for all dogs to establish baseline ERG responses. Dogs then received gabapentin (approx 30mg/kg), trazadone (approx 20 mg/kg or approx 5 mg/kg), or a combination ofgabapentin (approx 20 mg/kg) and trazodone (approx 5 mg/kg) orally, and the same ERG protocol was repeated 2 hours later. Dogs were given a washout period of atleast 1 week between treatments. RESULTS: a-Wave amplitudes were significantly (P= 0.018) decreased after administration of the combination of gabapentin andtrazodone. b-Wave amplitudes were significantly decreased after administration ofthe 20-mg/kg dose of trazodone (P = 0.006) and after administration of thecombination of gabapentin and trazodone (P = 0.002). Heavier dogs that receivedhigher total doses of trazodone had decreases in a-wave amplitude afteradministration of the 20-mg/kg dose of trazodone and in b-wave amplitude afteradministration of the 5-mg/kg dose of trazodone. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: High dosesof trazodone and the combination of gabapentin and trazodone significantlydecreased a-wave and b-wave amplitudes in clinically normal dogs. However, theeffects on retinal responses had little clinical importance. Therefore, thesemedications can be used safely in a clinical setting; however, further studiesare needed in dogs with retinal disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical feasibility of attenuation imaging of the hepatic parenchyma in healthy dogs, identify technical factors that influencemeasured attenuation coefficients, and determine intraobserver repeatability ofmeasurements. ANIMALS: 10 healthy Beagles. PROCEDURES: Attenuation coefficientswere calculated for various measurement sites (left vs central division of theliver), scanning planes (transverse vs sagittal plane), scanning depths (10 to 20mm vs 20 to 30 mm), scanning approaches (intercostal vs subcostal approach), and breathing conditions (free breathing vs breath holding at end expiration).Intraoperator intraday and interday reliability was assessed by computingintraclass correlation coefficients. RESULTS: Attenuation coefficients were notinfluenced significantly by scanning plane (P = .120 to 1.000), measurement site (P = .292 to .848), or breathing condition (P = .166). However, coefficients weresignificantly (P < .01) less with deeper scanning depths and significantly (P <.05) more for the subcostal approach than the intercostal approach. The intraday and interday intraclass correlation coefficients showed good repeatability (0.799and 0.771, respectively), regardless of the scanning plane and measurement site. Scanning the central division of the liver with the right intercostal approach ata depth of 10 to 20 mm from the liver capsule yielded good reliability. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Attenuation imaging was a feasible technique for evaluating thehepatic parenchyma in healthy dogs with good repeatability. Measured attenuation coefficients were not affected by the scanning plane, measurement site, orbreathing condition.

TI  - Long-acting injectable methadone (methadone-fluconazole) provides safe andeffective postoperative analgesia in a randomized clinical trial for dogsundergoing soft tissue surgery.
LID - 10.2460/ajvr.22.01.0014 [doi]
LID - ajvr.22.01.0014 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and adverse effectsof injectable methadone with the pharmacokinetic enhancer fluconazole(methadone-fluconazole), compared with the standard formulation of injectablemethadone, in dogs after ovariohysterectomy. We hypothesized that 2 doses ofmethadone-fluconazole would provide 24 hours of postoperative analgesia. ANIMALS:3 purpose-bred dogs (pharmacokinetic preliminary study) and 42 female dogs fromlocal shelters (clinical trial) were included. PROCEDURES: Pharmacokinetics were preliminarily determined. Clinical trial client-owned dogs were blocked by bodyweight into treatment groups: standard methadone group (methadone standardformulation, 0.5 mg/kg, SC, q 4 h; n = 20) or methadone-fluconazole group (0.5mg/kg methadone with 2.5 mg/kg fluconazole, SC, repeated once at 6 h; n = 22).All dogs also received acepromazine, propofol, and isoflurane. Surgeries wereperformed by experienced surgeons, and dogs were monitored perioperatively using the Glasgow Composite Measure Pain Scale-Short Form (CMPS-SF) and sedationscales. Evaluators were masked to treatment. RESULTS: Findings frompharmacokinetic preliminary studies supported that 2 doses ofmethadone-fluconazole provide 24 hours of drug exposure. The clinical trial hadno significant differences in treatment failures or postoperative CMPS-SF scores between treatments. One dog (methadone-fluconazole group) had CMPS-SF > 6 andreceived rescue analgesia. All dogs had moderate sedation or less by 1 hour(methadone-fluconazole group) or 4 hours (standard methadone group)postoperatively. Sedation was completely resolved in all dogs the day aftersurgery. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Methadone-fluconazole with twice-dailyadministration was well tolerated and provided effective postoperative analgesia for dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy. Clinical compliance and postoperativepain control may improve with an effective twice-daily formulation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the biomechanical properties and gapping characteristicsfollowing loop modification of a 3-loop-pulley (3LP) pattern in an ex vivo caninecommon calcaneal tendon (CCT) avulsion repair model. SAMPLE: 56 skeletally maturehindlimbs from 28 canine cadavers. PROCEDURES: The CCTs were randomized to 1 of 4experimental groups (n = 14/group) then sharply transected at the teno-osseousjunction. Groups consisted of a 3LP, 4-loop-pulley (4LP), 5-loop-pulley (5LP), or6-loop-pulley (6LP) pattern with loops placed 60 degrees apart using size-0polypropylene. Yield, peak, and failure loads, construct stiffness, loads toproduce a 3-mm teno-osseous gap, and failure mode were evaluated and comparedbetween groups. RESULTS: Yield (P = 0.001), peak (P < 0.001), and failure loads(P < 0.001), construct stiffness (P < 0.001), and loads to 3-mm gap formation (P = 0.005) were all significantly greater for 6LP compared to all other groups.Mode of failure did not differ among groups (P = 0.733) with 75% (42/56) ofrepairs failing by mechanism of core sutures pulling through the tendinoustissue. Pattern modification by increasing the number of loops increased therepair site strength by 1.4, 1.6, and 1.8 times for 4LP, 5LP, and 6LP compared to3LP, respectively. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Increasing the number of suture loopscompared to a traditional 3LP repair is a relatively simple techniquemodification that significantly increases teno-osseous repair site strength andloads required to cause 3-mm gap formation. The results of this study justifyfurther focused investigation of increasing the number of suture loops in vivofor teno-osseous CCT repair in dogs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) graft augmentation on the biomechanical properties and resistance to gapformation in a canine gastrocnemius tendon repair model. SAMPLE POPULATION: 28canine cadaveric hind limbs. PROCEDURES: Respective hindlimbs from each dog were randomized to one of two groups (n = 14/group) using a 3-loop-pulley (3LP)pattern alone or 3LP + SDFT graft augmentation. Biomechanical parametersevaluated included yield, peak, and failure loads; tensile loads required tocreate 1- and 3-mm gap formations; and mode of construct failure. RESULTS: Meanyield and failure loads for the 3LP + SDFT graft group were 483.6 +/- 148.0 N and478.3 +/- 147.9 N, respectively, and were greater compared to the 3LP group (34.2+/- 6.7 N and 34.0 +/- 8.0 N, P < .0001). Loads to both 1- and 3-mm gapformations for the 3LP + SDFT graft group were greater compared to 3LP alone (P <.001). Failure modes did not differ between groups (P = .120), with constructsfailing most commonly by suture pulling through opposed tendinous tissues whereasSDFT grafts remained intact. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: SDFT graft augmentationincreased yield, peak, and failure forces 14-fold across all examinedbiomechanical variables compared to the 3LP group. The 3LP + SDFT graft grouprequired 3.6X and 6.5X greater loads to cause a 1- and 3-mm gap, respectively,between tendon ends. These data support the biomechanical advantages of SDFTgraft augmentation to increase repair-site strength and to promote resistance to gap formation of the tenorrhaphy. Additional in vivo studies are required todetermine the effect of SDFT augmentation on clinical function and active limbuse after graft harvest in dogs.

LID - ajvr.22.03.0057 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate changes in ground reaction forces (GRFs) in relation togait velocity using 2 force plates (FPs) for healthy Beagles. ANIMALS: 18 healthyBeagles were included (body weight, 10.45 +/- 1.28 kg; age, 26 +/- 11 months).PROCEDURES: Ten GRF parameters were measured at three gait velocities (walk, 0.9 to 1.2 m/s; trot 1, 1.6 to 2.0 m/s; and trot 2, 2.1 to 2.5 m/s): peak lateralforce (PLF), peak medial force (PMF), lateral impulse (LI), medial impulse (MI), peak propulsive force (PPF), peak braking force (PBF), propulsive impulse (PI),braking impulse (BI), peak vertical force (PVF), and vertical impulse (VI).RESULTS: As velocity increased, the PVF of all limbs increased, the VI of alllimbs decreased, and the PPF of the forelimbs increased. At all velocities, PBFand BI were significantly higher than the PPF and PI in forelimbs; however, PBFand BI were significantly lower than the PPF and PI in hindlimbs. There were nosignificant differences in the PLF, PMF, LI, and MI of the forelimbs andhindlimbs among all velocities. The PLF was significantly higher than the PMF of forelimbs during trot 1 and trot 2. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These results may beuseful when comparing healthy Beagles with diseased ones when premorbid data are not available. Because the forelimbs are mainly responsible for the brakingforce, it is suggested that weight bearing is more stable in the forelimbs thanin the hindlimbs, which are mainly responsible for the propulsive force, and thata greater force is generated laterally than medially during trot.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential contamination of commercial raw dog foodproducts with bacteria of the Enterobacterales order that produce extendedspectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and carbapenemase enzymes, determine risk factors for contamination, and understand isolate genetic diversity. SAMPLES: A total of 200 canine raw food products. METHODS: Products were cultured on selectivechromogenic agar following enrichment steps. Whole-genome sequencing wasperformed for isolates that were confirmed to produce an ESBL. Isolates werecharacterized by antimicrobial resistance genes, and multilocus sequences typing,and compared to other isolates in the NCBI database for clonality. Preservationmethod and protein sources were assessed as potential risk factors forcontamination with ESBL and carbapenemase-producing bacteria of theEnterobacterales order. RESULTS: No carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales(CPE) were identified, but ESBL-producing Enterobacterales bacteria were isolatedfrom 20/200 products (10.0%; 95% CI, 7.3 to 16.5%), all of which were frozen.Pork-derived protein source products were 8.1 times (P = .001; 95% CI, 2.53 to26.2) more likely to carry ESBL-producing Enterobacterales bacteria than otherprotein sources. WGS analysis confirmed the presence of ESBL genes in a total of 25 distinct isolates (19 Escherichia coli, 5 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1Citrobacter braakii). Genes encoding CTX-M type ESBL enzymes were the most common(24/25 isolates, 96.0%) with blaCTX-M-27 being the most common allele (8/25,32.0%). CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Frozen, raw food products may serve as a route oftransmission of ESBL-producing Enterobacterales bacteria to companion animals.Veterinarians should advise owners about the risks of raw food diets, includingpotential exposure to antimicrobial-resistant bacteria.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate effects of loop diameter of a modified Kesslerlocking-loop (LL) suture on in vitro tensile strength and gapping characteristicsof canine flexor tendon repairs. SAMPLE: 48 cadaveric superficial digital flexor tendons from 24 adult medium- to large-breed dogs. PROCEDURES: Flexor tendonswere randomly assigned to 4 groups (n = 12/group) and repaired with 2-0polypropylene in a LL pattern with loops measuring 1, 2, 3, or 4 mm in diameter. Biomechanical loads, gap formation between tendon ends, and failure modes wereevaluated and compared between groups. RESULTS: Increasing loop diameter from 1to 4 mm significantly increased yield (P = .048), peak (P < .001), and failure (P< .001) loads. There were no significant differences in yield, peak, and failure loads between 1- and 2-mm loops. Load to 3-mm gap formation was significantly (P < .001) greater for 4-mm loops, compared with 1-, 2-, and 3-mm loops. Failuremode did not differ significantly among experimental groups, with 46 of 48 (96%) of constructs failing because of suture breakage. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Loopdiameter of a LL suture pattern is an important biomechanical variable thatinfluences construct biomechanics of canine tendon suture repairs. Loop diameters> 3 mm are recommended when the size of the tendon allows. Further studies arenecessary to determine the in vivo effect of these findings, particularly theeffects on tendon blood supply.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare the anesthetic effects ofalfaxalone-ketamine-midazolam (AKM) and alfaxalone-ketamine-dexmedetomidine (AKD)in black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus). ANIMALS: 9 male black-tailedprairie dogs. PROCEDURES: Prairie dogs were anesthetized with AKM (6 mg/kgalfaxalone, 30 mg/kg ketamine, and 1.5 mg/kg midazolam) and AKD (6 mg/kgalfaxalone, 30 mg/kg ketamine, and 0.15 mg/kg dexmedetomidine) in a prospective, complete cross-over study. Atipamezole (1.5 mg/kg) after AKD or flumazenil(0.1mg/kg) after AKM was administered 45 minutes after induction of anesthesia.Onset of general anesthesia, physiologic parameters, depth of anesthesia, andtime to recovery after reversal administration were evaluated for each treatment.RESULTS: Both AKM and AKD produced a deep plane of anesthesia in black-tailedprairie dogs that varied in duration. The median induction times for AKM and AKD were 82 and 60 seconds, respectively. The median recovery times for AKM and AKDwere 27 and 21 minutes, respectively. There were no significant differencesbetween protocols for induction (P = .37) and recovery (P = .51) times. Allmeasured reflexes were absent in all animals at 5 minutes postinduction, withhindlimb reflexes returning prior to forelimb reflexes. Heart rate was lower but respiratory rate was higher in the AKD treatment. Body temperature decreasedsignificantly for both protocols (P < .001) and was significantly lower with AKM than AKD (P < .001). CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Both AKM and AKD produced a deep planeof anesthesia in black-tailed prairie dogs. For both protocols, heat support and oxygen support are indicated.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of combining one-lung ventilation and carbondioxide insufflation (OLV-CDI) on intrathoracic working space (determined bymeans of CT) during thoracoscopy in dogs and investigate conditions that couldsafely improve working space compared with OLV alone. ANIMALS: 6 healthy Beagles.PROCEDURES: Dogs were anesthetized, and right- or left-sided (n = 3/side) OLV wasinstituted. On the blocked side, a laparoscopic trocar sleeve was placed in theninth intercostal space for CDI. CT was performed under 3 conditions: with OLValone, with OLV-CDI at an intrapleural pressure (IPP) of 3 mm Hg, and withOLV-CDI at an IPP of 5 mm Hg. Working space volume (WSV), ventilation spacevolume (VSV), and thoracic cavity volume (TCV) were determined from CT images.RESULTS: With OLV-CDI at an IPP of 3 or 5 mm Hg, WSV and TCV were significantlyincreased, compared with values obtained during OLV alone. With OLV-CDI at an IPPof 5 mm Hg, VSV and Spo2 were significantly decreased, compared with valuesobtained during OLV alone. Additionally, contralateral pneumothorax was observed in 4 dogs at an IPP of 5 mm Hg. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Combining OLV and CDI couldprovide a larger working space than OLV alone, even with an IPP of 3 mm Hg, indogs of limited size. However, an evaluation of the effects on oxygenation andcardiovascular variables is needed before clinical use.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the duration and analgesic quality of bupivacaine mixedwith dexmedetomidine (BUP-DEX) or bupivacaine liposome suspension (BLS)administered as a transverse abdominis plane (TAP) block, compared with anegative control (no TAP block; CTRL) in dogs. ANIMALS: 26 mixed-breed shelterdogs undergoing elective ovariohysterectomy between January 28 and December 8,2020. PROCEDURES: Each dog was randomly assigned to receive either anultrasound-guided TAP block with either BUP-DEX or BLS or to receive no TAP blockat time 0 after induction of general anesthesia. Superficial and abdominal wallpain scores were evaluated before time 0 and at 4, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96hours later. Additionally, sedation scores and time to return of variousbehaviors, such as eating or drinking, were compared. RESULTS: The CTRL group hadsignificantly greater pain scores than the BUP-DEX and BLS groups, but nodifferences were found between the BUP-DEX and BLS groups. Postoperatively,significantly more dogs needed rescue analgesia and the time to need it wasshorter for the CTRL group, compared with the BUP-DEX or BLS groups.Additionally, the CTRL group had greater sedation scores than the other 2 groups.No significant differences were observed in any of the evaluated outcomevariables such as eating or drinking. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A TAP block appeared toprovide adequate postoperative analgesia for abdominal surgery in the dogs of thepresent study undergoing elective ovariohysterectomy. The BLS TAP block did notappear to provide any extra benefit beyond what BUP-DEX TAP block added underthese specific conditions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility and pharmacokinetics of cytarabinedelivery as a subcutaneous continuous-rate infusion with the Omnipod system.ANIMALS: 6 client-owned dogs diagnosed with meningoencephalomyelitis of unknownetiology were enrolled through the North Carolina State University VeterinaryHospital. PROCEDURES: Cytarabine was delivered at a rate of 50 mg/m2/hour as anSC continuous-rate infusion over 8 hours using the Omnipod system. Plasma sampleswere collected at 0, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 hours after initiation of theinfusion. Plasma cytarabine concentrations were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography. A nonlinear mixed-effects approach generated populationpharmacokinetic parameter estimates. RESULTS: The mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was 7,510 ng/mL (range, 5,040 to 9,690 ng/mL; SD, 1,912.41 ng/mL), averagetime to Cmax was 7 hours (range, 4 to 8 hours; SD, 1.67 hours), terminalhalf-life was 1.13 hours (SD, 0.29 hour), and the mean area under the curve was52,996.82 hours X mug/mL (range, 35,963.67 to 71,848.37 hours X mug/mL; SD,12,960.90 hours X mug/mL). Cmax concentrations for all dogs were more than 1,000 ng/mL (1.0 mug/mL) at the 4-, 6-, 8-, and 10-hour time points. CLINICALRELEVANCE: An SC continuous-rate infusion of cytarabine via the Omnipod system isfeasible in dogs and was able to achieve a steady-state concentration of morethan 1 mug/mL 4 to 10 hours postinitiation of cytarabine and a Cmax of 7,510ng/mL (range, 5,040 to 9,690 ng/mL; SD, 1,912.41 ng/mL). These are comparable to values reported previously with IV continuous-rate infusion administration inhealthy research Beagles and dogs with meningoencephalomyelitis of unknownetiology.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare metabolomic profiles of dogs eating grain-free (GF) versus grain-inclusive (GI) diets (1) for healthy dogs at baseline and (2) for dogs withsubclinical cardiac abnormalities at 12 months after a diet change. SAMPLE: Serumsamples from 23 dogs eating GF diets and 79 dogs eating GI diets, of which 17 (8 eating a GF diet and 9 eating a GI diet) were reevaluated 12 months after a diet change. PROCEDURES: Metabolomic profiles were developed by means ofultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy of serumsamples. Baseline results for the GF group were compared with those for the GIgroup. Dogs from both groups with subclinical cardiac abnormalities weretransitioned to a GI, pulse-free, intervention diet, and samples collected 12months later were compared between diet groups. Statistical significance forbiochemical group differences was defined as P < .05 with a false discovery rate (q) < .10. RESULTS: Baseline differences in lipid metabolism and amino acidmetabolism were found between the GF and GI diet groups. There were 46metabolites that were higher and 82 metabolites that were lower in the GF group(n = 23), compared with the GI group (79). Comparison of the GF (n = 8) and GI(9) groups 12 months after the diet change showed only 6 metabolites that werehigher and 11 metabolites that were lower in the GF group, compared with the GIgroup. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Metabolomic pathway differences between dogs eating GFversus GI diets highlight the important effect of diet in metabolomics analyses. The clinical importance of these differences and how they might relate to cardiacdisease in dogs remains undetermined.

LID - ajvr.21.10.0171 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the attenuation of the medial coronoid process (MCP) indogs with and without arthroscopically confirmed evidence of medial coronoiddisease (MCD). ANIMALS: The database at our institution was searched for caseswith thoracic limb lameness, diagnosed with MCD by arthroscopic examination that had CT as part of their investigation and compared with a control group of elbow joints from cadavers euthanized for reasons unrelated to MCD. A total of 84 elbowjoints were included that met these criteria. PROCEDURES: Following CT, astandardized measurement of the MCP was obtained from apex to base and the meanattenuation, SD, and total area were recorded. A comparative measurement wasobtained from the proximal radial cortex at the level of the nutrient foramen.Elbow joint arthroscopy was carried out using standard portals, and the modified Outerbridge score was (MOS) used to score elbow joint cartilage. Descriptive and inferential statistics were carried out using MLwiN and R. RESULTS: Attenuationof the MCP was reduced in dogs with MCD compared with those with no MCD (P <.002). No significant differences were observed in the attenuation betweencategories of severity (MOS). There was good inter- and intraobserver agreementbetween measurements (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.89 and 0.95,respectively). CLINICAL RELEVANCE: MCP attenuation is reduced in dogs with MCDcompared with dogs with no evidence of MCD. This finding may be a useful tool forearly detection of MCD, but there is no relationship with arthroscopic lesionseverity.

LID - ajvr.21.12.0215 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility and accuracy of using 2 methods forreduction and alignment of simulated comminuted diaphyseal tibial fractures inconjunction with 3-D-printed patient-specific pin guides. SAMPLE: Paired pelviclimbs from 8 skeletally mature dogs weighing 20 to 35 kg. METHODS: CT images ofboth tibiae were obtained, and 3-D reconstructions of the tibiae were used tocreate proximal and distal patient-specific pin guides. These guides were printedand used to facilitate fracture reduction and alignment in conjunction witheither a 3-D-printed reduction guide or a linear type 1A external fixator.Postreduction CT images were used to assess the accuracy of pin guide placementand the accuracy of fracture reduction and alignment. RESULTS: The 3-D-printedguides were applied with acceptable ease. Guides for both groups were placed withminor but detectable deviations from the planned location (P = .01), butdeviations were not significantly different between groups. Fracture reductionresulted in similar minor but detectable morphological differences from theintact tibiae (P = .01). In both groups, fracture reduction and alignment werewithin clinically acceptable parameters for fracture stabilization by means ofminimally invasive plate osteosynthesis. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Virtual surgicalplanning and fabrication of patient-specific 3-D-printed pin guides have thepotential to facilitate fracture reduction and alignment during use of minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis for fracture stabilization.

LID - ajvr.22.04.0069 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and efficacy of the platelet-like nanoparticle(PLN), and to assess its safety in repeated administration. ANIMALS: 6purpose-bred dogs. PROCEDURES: The PLN was administered IV at 3 different dosesusing a randomized crossover design. Each dog received a full dose of 8 X 1010particles/10 kg, half dose, and 10 times the dose, with a 14-day washout periodbetween doses. Biochemical, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, andfibrinogen analyses were performed at baseline and 96 hours postinfusion. A CBC, kaolin-activated thromboelastography, platelet function assay closure time, andbuccal mucosal bleeding time were performed at baseline and 1, 6, 24, 48, 72, and96 hours postinfusion. RESULTS: No significant changes were observed over time inthe thromboelastography parameters, closure time, and buccal mucosal bleedingtime. After the administration of the half dose, hematocrit levels decreasedsignificantly at 1, 6, 24, 48, and 96 hours, with all values within the referencerange. The platelet count was decreased significantly at hours 1, 6, 24, 48, and 72 after administration of the half dose, with values less than the referencerange at all hours but hour 72. No significant changes in serum biochemistry,coagulation panel, and fibrinogen were observed for all doses. No adverse events were noted during the first infusion. Three dogs experienced transient sedationand nausea after repeat infusion. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The PLN resulted in adilution of hematocrit and platelets, and did not significantly alter hemostasis negatively. The safety of repeated doses should be investigated further in dogs.

LID - 10.2460/ajvr.22.04.0073 [doi]
LID - ajvr.22.04.0073 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To create a model of transient unilateral laryngeal paralysis (LP)that will allow the study of cricoarytenoideus dorsalis dysfunction and a method for quantification of varying degrees of LP in dogs. ANIMALS: 5 castrated maleresearch Beagles. PROCEDURES: Between January and February 2018, dogs wereanesthetized and instrumented with a laryngeal mask airway and a flexibleendoscope to record the rima glottidis. The left or right recurrent laryngealnerve (RLn) was localized using ultrasonography and electrical stimulation, then conduction blockade was induced with perineural lidocaine. The normalized glottalgap area (NGGA) was measured before and every 15 minutes after the block.Inspired 10% carbon dioxide (CO2) was administered for 1 minute at each sampling time. The inspiratory increase in NGGA (total and each side) was measured at peakinspiration. The change in hemi-NGGA for the control side versus the anesthetizedside was evaluated with a mixed-effect model. RESULTS: During CO2 stimulation,the increase in inspiratory hemi-NGGA was consistently less (P < .001) for thetreated side (-8% to 13%) versus the control side (49% to 82%). A compensatoryincrease (larger than at baseline) in the control hemi-NGGA was observed. Thetotal NGGA remained unaffected. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Unilateral local anesthesiaof the RLn produced transient unilateral LP with a compensatory increase in thehemi-NGGA for the contralateral side. This model could facilitate the evaluation of respiratory dynamics, establishment of a grading system, and collection ofother important information that is otherwise difficult to obtain in dogs withLP.

LID - ajvr.22.03.0040 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether muscle-sparing laryngoplasty results in fewerchanges in swallowing function compared to standard surgical treatment forlaryngeal paralysis. ANIMALS: 12 clinically normal sexually intact male Beagles. PROCEDURES: Group A dogs (n = 4) had a standard approach to the larynx, with leftarytenoid cartilage lateralization. Group B dogs (n = 4) had a muscle-sparinglaryngoplasty performed with the thyropharyngeus muscle fibers bluntly separated,and the cricoarytenoideus dorsalis muscle spared. Pre- and 24-hour postoperative fluoroscopic swallowing studies were performed and graded. Larynges wereharvested after humane euthanasia, and glottic area was measured. Group C dogs (n= 4) acted as controls, with surgical dissection ending lateral to thethyropharyngeus muscle, arytenoid lateralization not performed, and the dogs not euthanized. The study was performed between October 15, 2011 and May 15, 2021.RESULTS: Changes in pharyngeal and upper esophageal sphincter function were notdetected in any group. There was no difference in glottic area between treatment groups. Aspiration of liquid was not a consistent finding. Two dogs in eachtreatment group developed moderate to severe cervical esophageal paresis. Thisdid not occur in control dogs. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: We found no evidence tosupport our hypothesis that muscle-sparing laryngoplasty results in less severechanges in swallowing function compared to a standard technique. The cervicalesophageal paresis identified in both treatment groups could increase the risk ofpostoperative aspiration pneumonia in dogs treated for laryngeal paralysis via a lateral approach to the larynx. Further study to determine the frequency, cause, and duration of esophageal dysfunction is warranted.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare erythrocyte recovery by a cell salvage device betweenswab-washing by manual agitation or filtration. SAMPLE: 12 recently expired unitsof canine packed RBCs. PROCEDURE: The packed RBC units underwent quality analysisbefore donation from a pet blood bank. Each unit was volume-expanded withanticoagulant and subsequently divided into 2 equal aliquots used to soaksurgical swabs before washing. Two different swab-washing techniques wereevaluated-standard swab-washing-manual agitation (SW-MA) andswab-washing-filtration (SW-F)-with a novel prototype device. The resultingbloody fluid was processed using the Cell Saver Elite Autotransfusion System(Haemonetics). The volume, manual PCV, CBC, and RBC mass, calculated as theproduct of the volume and PCV, were measured before and after salvaging. Last,the RBC mass recovery was recorded as a percentage. RESULTS: The RBC massrecovered from SW-MA and SW-F averaged 85.73% and 83.99%, respectively. There wasno significant difference in RBC recovery between the 2 methods (P = .52).CLINICAL RELEVANCE: SW-MA and SW-F recovered a similar quantity of RBCs fromblood-soaked swabs in an ex vivo setting.

TI  - Respiratory phase can affect pulmonary vein-to-pulmonary artery ratio measuredwith CT.
LID - 10.2460/ajvr.22.02.0026 [doi]

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate pulmonary vein (PV)-to-pulmonary artery (PA) ratiosobtained in healthy dogs by means of various CT protocols, accounting for theeffects of the respiratory phase and contrast agent used. ANIMALS: 10 healthyBeagles. PROCEDURES: Before and after contrast medium (600 mg iodine/kg) wasinjected IV, thoracic CT was performed with a positive-pressure breath-hold(inspiratory phase) and at the end of expiration (expiratory phase). After CTscanning, echocardiography was performed, and an optimized right parasternallong-axis view was obtained for measurement of PV and PA diameters. The PV and PAdiameters were measured subsequently for each CT protocol. RESULTS: Mean +/- SDPV:PA values obtained from pre- and postcontrast inspiratory CT were 1.058 +/-0.072 and 1.020 +/- 0.053, respectively, which were comparable to theechocardiographic value (P > .05). Mean PV:PA values obtained with pre- andpostcontrast expiratory CT were 1.259 +/- 0.094 and 1.239 +/- 0.066,respectively, which were significantly (P = .005) greater than inspiratory CTmeasurements. There was a significant (r > 0.5, P < .05) linear relationshipbetween PV:PA values obtained with pre- and postcontrast inspiratory CT andechocardiography. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: PV:PA could be measured with thoracic CT ina manner similar to that for echocardiography. However, PV:PA values measuredwith expiratory CT were different from previously reported values. Therefore, therespiratory phase should be considered when evaluating pulmonary vascular sizethrough CT, and measurements with the inspiratory CT protocol would be moreaccurate.

TI  - Characterizing veteran and PTSD service dog teams: Exploring potential mechanismsof symptom change and canine predictors of efficacy.
PG  - e0269186
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0269186 [doi]
AB  - Psychiatric service dogs are an emerging complementary intervention forposttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Initial evidence suggests that partnership with a service dog may be related to less PTSD symptom severity. However, itremains unclear how or why this might occur. To address this gap, we conducted a longitudinal investigation of 82 post-9/11 military members or veterans and theirPTSD service dogs to (1) evaluate service dog characteristics as potentialpredictors of efficacy, (2) assess dog and human characteristics as potentialpredictors of veteran-dog bond, and (3) explore potential mechanisms for mentalhealth outcomes. Aim 1 results demonstrated that most service dog characteristicsdid not predict veterans' mental health outcomes, but lower service dogexcitability was associated with less PTSD symptom severity at follow-up. Aim 2results showed that closer dog-veteran relationships were associated with lessexcitable dog temperament. Aim 3 results indicated that worse mental health atfollow-up was associated with greater use of the specifically trained PTSDservice dog task to initiate a social greeting ("make a friend"), whereas better mental health was related to less use of dominance-based training methods, lower perceived emotional/logistical costs of service dog partnership, and closerveteran-dog relationships. More frequent use of the trained service dog task tosignal when someone approaches from behind (cover/watch back) was associated withgreater anxiety, but less PTSD symptom severity. Overall, veterans spent anaverage of 82% of their time with service dogs (assessed via Bluetooth proximity between dog collar and veteran smartphone), and most frequently asked theirservice dogs to perform the trained task for calming their anxiety (calm/comfort anxiety). The present study provides subjective and objective metrics of theheterogeneity among veteran-service dog dyads while also suggesting which of the assessed metrics might be potential mechanisms involved in the intervention.

AB  - This report summarizes the status of the global Dracunculiasis EradicationProgram as of the end of 2021. Dracunculiasis (Guinea worm disease) has beeneliminated from 17 of 21 countries where it was endemic in 1986, when anestimated 3.5 million cases occurred worldwide. Only Chad, Ethiopia, Mali, andSouth Sudan reported cases in humans in 2021. Chad, Ethiopia, and Mali alsoreported indigenous infections of animals, mostly domestic dogs, with Dracunculusmedinensis. Insecurity and infections in animals are the main obstacles remainingto interrupting dracunculiasis transmission completely.

LID - tpmd210783 [pii]
AB  - Flea-borne spotted fever is an emerging insect-borne rickettsial infection causedby Rickettsia felis and has been identified worldwide. This study sought toexplore the prevalence of rickettsiae associated with fleas on companion dogs andcats from Walker and Montgomery Counties in East Texas. Fleas were collected fromanimals entering local veterinary clinics for routine checkups. Collected fleaswere identified as Ctenocephalides felis or Pulex irritans and analyzed bypolymerase chain reaction for the presence of rickettsiae and subsequentsequencing. An estimation of the bcMLE (bias-corrected maximum likelihoodestimation) of pooled samples was calculated. Four hundred eighty-eight fleas(comprising C. felis and P. irritans) were collected from 16 cats and 77 dogs.Our results demonstrate R. felis in 21 pools of fleas from dogs (bcMLE 15.28%)and a bcMLE of 7.25% from flea samples collected from cats. Sequence analysisrevealed R. felis as the only Rickettsia that could be amplified in our samplesusing the rickettsial citrate synthase gene and subsequent sequencing. In thisstudy, the presence of R. felis in fleas from companion cats and dogs suggests a potential risk of flea-borne spotted fever in humans who encounter flea-infested animals.

LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.21-1203 [doi]
AB  - Plasmid-Mediated Colistin Resistance 1 (mcr-1) was first reported in 2015 and is a great concern to human health. In this study, we investigated the prevalence ofmcr-1 and mcr-1-positive Escherichia coli (MCRPEC) and the association ininfection status among various reservoirs connected to livestock. The study wasconducted in 70 poultry and swine farms in a commune in Ha Nam province, northernVietnam. Samples were collected from farmers, food animals, domestic animals, andfarm environments (flies and wastewater) for polymerase chain reaction (PCR)screening for mcr-1 gene and species identification of PCR positive isolates.Among 379 obtained mcr-1 positives isolates, Escherichia coli was the majoridentified, varying from 50% (2/4) in dog feces to 100% (31/31) in humans fecesisolates. The prevalence of MCRPEC was 14.4% (20/139), 49.7% (96/193), 31.3%(25/80), 36.7% (40/109), 26.9% (18/67), and 3.9% (2/51) in humans, chickens,pigs, flies, wastewater, and dogs, respectively. The study identified associationbetween MCRPEC infection status in humans and flies (OR = 3.4), between flies andchickens (OR = 5.3), and between flies and pigs (OR = 9.0). Farmers' age and farmlivestock unit were also associated factors of MCRPEC infection status in humans (OR = 5.1 and 1.05, respectively). These findings bring new knowledge onantibiotic resistance in livestock setting and important suggestions on potentialrole of flies in the transmission of mcr-1 resistance gene.

TI  - Association of Lymphatic Fluid Volume in the Inner Ear of Beagle Dogs with theSusceptibility to Motion Sickness.
PG  - 340-346
LID - 10.5152/iao.2022.21584 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to quantify total lymphatic fluid spaces of theinner ears volumetrically in the dog in order to find a correlation between thelymphatic volume of the inner ears and motion sickness susceptibility. METHODS: Atotal of 16 healthy adult Beagle dogs were used to delineate the lymphatic fluid spaces of inner ears by magnetic resonance imag- ing with a3-dimensional-constructive interference steady-state sequence. Manualsegmentation was applied for 3-dimensional reconstruction and volumetricquantification of total lymphatic space. The susceptibility of Beagle dogs tomotion sickness was judged by latency of vomiting during rotatory stimulus.RESULTS: The volume range of total fluid space in the vestibule and cochlea ofBeagle dogs is 55.07 +/- 6.2 mm3. There is no significant difference in the totallymphatic volume of bilateral inner ears between 2 different motion sicknesssusceptibility groups (i.e., sensitive group and insensi- tive group), but thedifference of lymphatic volume in the cochlea and vestibule between bilateralinner ears in insensitive group is greater than that of sensitive group.Moreover, a significant positive correlation was found between bilateral innerear difference in lymphatic volume and vomiting latency. CONCLUSION: Magneticresonance imaging could be used as a method to evaluate the inner ear lymphaticfluid volume of Beagle dogs with different susceptibilities to motion sickness,through which we found that motion sickness susceptibility is related to thedifference in lymphatic volume in the vestibule and cochlea between bilateralinner ears, and the larger the volume difference, the lower the susceptibility.

AB  - There is a shortage of studies reporting the efficacy of antimicrobial treatment of dogs with atopic dermatitis (AD) and skin infections (SIs). The aim of thisstudy was to evaluate the change in the severity of skin lesions and pruritus,and the overall efficacy of antimicrobial treatment, in dogs with AD andbacterial overgrowth/infection and/or Malassezia dermatitis. A total of 20 dogswith AD and SIs were prospectively enrolled (group A) and they were examinedbefore and after the administration of systemic antimicrobials that resulted inthe resolution of SIs. In addition, 19 dogs fulfilling the same inclusioncriteria and treated with systemic, with or without topical antimicrobials, were included retrospectively (group B). Since there were no major differences betweenthe groups, their results were combined. The severity of skin lesions decreasedsignificantly, by 30% based on Canine Atopic Dermatitis Extent and SeverityIndex-4 (CADESI-4), by 28.1% based on the erythema domain of CADESI-4 and basedon owner's global assessment of the severity of skin lesions. Pruritus decreased significantly, by 34.7% based on the Pruritus Visual Analogue Scale (PVAS). Theefficacy of antimicrobial treatment was assessed as good to excellent by theinvestigator and the owner in 55% and 60% of the dogs, respectively. Despite the significant improvement, there was high variability in the response to treatment among dogs. Further studies are needed to find factors that determine theresponse to antimicrobial treatment in dogs with AD and SIs.

LID - 10.3390/vetsci9080383 [doi]
AB  - Human gastric cancer (GC) ranks as the fifth most prevalent cancer worldwide, andis the third leading cause of cancer-related death. The incidence of GC is lower in dogs than in humans, accounting for less than 1% of all canine malignancies.In recent years, efforts have been made to understand the pathogenesis of GC and in find an appropriate therapy to maximize curative results, such as adjuvantchemotherapy treatments in addition to surgery. Although surgery is thefirst-line treatment, it is associated with several complications. In terms ofchemotherapeutic intervention, canine gastric cancer has not received muchattention, probably due to its late diagnosis, fast progression, low mediansurvival time, and very high mortality rate, along with the lack of publications with concrete scientific results. In this review, we explore canine GC and thepharmacological approach used in the treatment of this often-fatal disease.

AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) haveemerged as non-invasive diagnostic techniques for the diagnosis of pancreatic andpancreatic duct disorders in humans. The number of studies focused on MR and MRCPfor pancreatic disease in small animals is very limited. MR has been describedfor the evaluation of insulinoma in dogs and to investigate pancreatitis in cats.The studies were based on a standard protocol with T2 weighted (w) fast recovery fast spin-echo (FRFSE) with and without fat suppression, T1w FSE pre-contrast andT1w FSE post-contrast with and without fat suppression. MRCP after secretinstimulation has been described in cats to assess the pancreatic ductal system,taking advantage of pulse sequences heavily T2w as rapid acquisition with rapidenhancement (RARE), fast-recovery fast spin-echo (FRFSE) sequences andsingle-shot fast spin-echo (SSFSE) sequences. In addition to the standardprotocol, fast spoiled gradient recalled echo pulse sequences (fSPGR) and volume interpolated 3D gradient-echo T1w pulse sequences pre and post-contrast have alsobeen used in cats, reaching the goal of assessing the biliary tree and thepancreatic duct with the same sequence and in multiple planes. Despite the small amount of data, the results show potential, and the most recent technicalinnovations, in particular, focused on diffusion MRI and fast acquisition,further support the need for continued evaluation of MRI as an effectiveinstrument for the investigation of pancreatic disease.

LID - 10.3390/ph15080922 [doi]
AB  - New compounds with 1H-pyrazolo [3,4-d]pyrimidin-6-amine core scaffolds weresynthesized and characterized in vitro to determine their affinity for human A2A and A1 receptors. Among the tested compounds, a few compounds displayed nanomolarbinding affinities for both receptors. One particular compound, 11o, showed high binding activities (hA2A Ki = 13.3 nM; hA1 Ki = 55 nM) and full antagonism (hA2A IC50 = 136 nM; hA1 IC50 = 98.8 nM) toward both receptors. Further tests showedthat 11o has low hepatic clearance and good pharmacokinetic properties in mice,along with high bioavailability and a high brain plasma ratio. In addition, 11owas associated with very low cardiovascular risk and mutagenic potential, and waswell-tolerated in rats and dogs. When tested in an MPTP-induced mouse model ofParkinson's disease, 11o tended to improve behavior. Moreover, 11odose-dependently reversed haloperidol-induced catalepsy in female rats, withgraded ED50 of between 3 and 10 mg/kg. Taken together, these results suggest thatthis potent dual A2A/A1 receptor antagonist, 11o, is a good candidate for thetreatment of Parkinson's disease with an excellent metabolic and safety profile.

LID - 685 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/metabo12080685 [doi]
AB  - The stratum corneum of the epidermis acts as a life-sustaining permeabilitybarrier. Unique heterogeneous ceramides, especially omega-O-acylceramides, arekey components for the formation of stable lamellar membrane structures in thestratum corneum and are essential for a vital epidermal permeability barrier.Several enzymes involved in acylceramide synthesis have been demonstrated to beassociated with ichthyosis. The function of patatin-like phospholipasedomain-containing protein 1 (PNPLA1) was a mystery until the finding that PNPLA1 gene mutations were involved in autosomal-recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI) patients, both humans and dogs. PNPLA1 plays an essential role in thebiosynthesis of acylceramide as a CoA-independent transacylase. PNPLA1 genemutations cause decreased acylceramide levels and impaired skin barrier function.More and more mutations in PNPLA1 genes have been identified in recent years.Herein, we describe the structural and functional specificity of PNPLA1,highlight its critical roles in acylceramide synthesis and skin barriermaintenance, and summarize the PNPLA1 mutations currently identified in ARCIpatients.

LID - 10.3390/genes13081328 [doi]
AB  - Chronic superficial keratitis (CSK) is a progressive inflammatory condition ofthe eye (cornea) that can cause discomfort and blindness. Differential diseaserisk across dog breeds strongly suggests that CSK has a genetic basis. Inaddition to genetic risk, the occurrence of CSK is exacerbated by exposure toultraviolet light. Genome-wide association analysis considered 109 greyhounds, 70with CSK and the remainder with normal phenotype at an age over four years. Threeco-located variants on CFA18 near the 5' region of the Epidermal Growth FactorReceptor (EGFR) gene were associated with genome-wide significance aftermultiple-test correction (BICF2P579527, CFA18: 6,068,508, praw = 1.77 x 10(-7),pgenome = 0.017; BICF2P1310662, CFA18: 6,077,388, praw = 4.09 x 10(-7), pgenome =0.040; BICF2P160719, CFA18: 6,087,347, praw = 4.09 x 10(-7), pgenome = 0.040)(canFam4)). Of the top 10 associated markers, eight were co-located with thesignificantly associated markers on CFA18. The associated haplotype on CFA18 isprotective for the CSK condition. EGFR is known to play a role in cornealhealing, where it initiates differentiation and proliferation of epithelial cellsthat in turn signal the involvement of stromal keratocytes to commence apoptosis.Further validation of the putative functional variants is required prior to theiruse in genetic testing for breeding programs.

AB  - Heart failure occurs in increased oxidative stress conditions, which contributeto the progression of pathological changes. Orally or intravenously administered acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin) is typically used in human patients withacute myocardial ischemia. The study used an experimental porcineischemia-reperfusion model to evaluate the potential cardioprotective effect ofintracoronary administered ASA on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Thecardioprotective effect of ASA was evaluated by measuring selected oxidativestress markers levels in infarcted and non-infarcted myocardium 14 days after theprocedure, and three times in serum, before the procedure, during the reperfusionprocess, and after 14-day recovery. The results showed that intracoronaryadministrated ASA reduced the oxidative stress. The level of oxidative stress,measured with the non-enzymatic markers total antioxidant capacity (TAC), totaloxidative status (TOS), and malondialdehyde (MDA), and the enzymatic markersglutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathioneS-transferase (GST), in heart tissue was significantly higher in a control group injected with saline. The level of oxidative stress in serum, measured with TAC, TOS, oxidative stress index (OSI), and lipofuscin (LF), was also higher in thecontrol group than in animals injected with ASA. The confirmed cardioprotectiveeffect of intracoronary administered ASA provides the foundation for furtherstudies on ASA intracoronary application, which may lead to the development of a new therapy for the treatment of ischemia-reperfusion complications in humans.

LID - 10.3390/antiox11081427 [doi]
AB  - Scarce data exist on the effects of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) supplementation in dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). The purpose of this study was toinvestigate the effect of CoQ10 supplementation on oxidative stress markers(glutathione peroxidase, F2-isoprostanes), markers of inflammation (tumornecrosis factor-alpha, TNF soluble receptor II, leucocytes, and their subtypes), lymphocyte subpopulations (T helper and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, includingactivated T lymphocytes, and B lymphocytes), and echocardiographic and clinicalparameters in dogs with MMVD. In this randomized, controlled, double-blind,longitudinal study, 43 MMVD dogs in stages ACVIM (American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine classification) B2 and ACVIM C and D (congestive heart failure (CHF)) received water-soluble coenzyme Q10 (100 mg twice daily) or placebo for 3 months, and 12 non-supplemented healthy dogs served as controls. All parameterswere measured before and after supplementation in MMVD dogs and once in healthydogs. CoQ10 supplementation had a positive impact on neutrophil percentage,lymphocyte percentage, and lymphocyte concentration in our cohort of dogs withCHF (ACVIM C and D). Conclusion: CoQ10 as an oral supplement may have benefits interms of decreasing inflammation in dogs with MMVD and CHF.

TI  - SLC35A2 Deficiency Promotes an Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition-likePhenotype in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney Cells.
LID - 2273 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cells11152273 [doi]
AB  - In mammalian cells, SLC35A2 delivers UDP-galactose for galactosylation reactions that take place predominantly in the Golgi lumen. Mutations in the corresponding gene cause a subtype of a congenital disorder of glycosylation (SLC35A2-CDG).Although more and more patients are diagnosed with SLC35A2-CDG, the link between defective galactosylation and disease symptoms is not fully understood. Accordingto a number of reports, impaired glycosylation may trigger the process ofepithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We therefore examined whether theloss of SLC35A2 activity would promote EMT in a non-malignant epithelial cellline. For this purpose, we knocked out the SLC35A2 gene in Madin-Darby caninekidney (MDCK) cells. The resulting clones adopted an elongated, spindle-shapedmorphology and showed impaired cell-cell adhesion. Using qPCR and westernblotting, we revealed down-regulation of E-cadherin in the knockouts, while thefibronectin and vimentin levels were elevated. Moreover, the knockout cellsdisplayed reorganization of vimentin intermediate filaments and alteredsubcellular distribution of a vimentin-binding protein, formiminotransferasecyclodeaminase (FTCD). Furthermore, depletion of SLC35A2 triggered Golgicompaction. Finally, the SLC35A2 knockouts displayed increased motility andinvasiveness. In conclusion, SLC35A2-deficient MDCK cells showed severalhallmarks of EMT. Our findings point to a novel role for SLC35A2 as a gatekeeper of the epithelial phenotype.

TI  - Interspecific Contagious Yawning in Humans.

LID - 10.3390/ani12151908 [doi]
AB  - Contagious yawning, or the reflexive tendency to yawn following the detection of yawning in others, is well-documented among humans and a growing number of socialvertebrates. While the most common form of yawn contagion occurs betweenconspecifics, some non-human animals in captivity have been reported to yawn inresponse to yawns from human handlers/caregivers. The current research sought to provide the first formal investigation of whether people yawn contagiously inresponse to yawns from non-human animals. In addition, this study aimed to testwhether this response was modulated by phylogenetic relatedness anddomestication/social closeness. A total of 296 participants from AmazonMechanical Turk self-reported on their yawning behavior following exposure to a(1) control (non-yawning) condition or a compilation of yawning stimuli eitherfrom (2) fish, (3) amphibians, (4) reptiles, (5) birds, (6) non-primate mammals, (7) apes, or (8) domesticated cats and dogs. The results provide strong supportfor interspecific yawn contagion. However, neither the propensity to yawn(binary) nor total yawn frequency varied significantly across interspecificconditions. Overall, these findings suggest that the mechanisms governing yawncontagion can be activated by varied forms of yawning stimuli, including thosefrom distantly related and unfamiliar species.

LID - 1883 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12151883 [doi]
AB  - In many Western countries, castration is the most popular surgical desexingprocedure in dogs. The aim of the study was to identify the reasons for male dog castration and to determine the owners' perceptions about changes in dog behaviorbefore and after castration. An online survey was posted on social networkingsites dedicated to dogs. A total of 386 respondents participated in the survey.The main reason (39%) for castration was undesirable behavior, includinghyperactivity (8%), roaming (8%), mounting (7%), aggression (5%), marking (5%)and others (5%). This surgery did not change the prevalence of aggressivebehaviors towards people, but it reduced aggressive behaviors towards dogs andother animals. Castration did not reduce the presentation of anxious behavior in fearful dogs. Castration increased the number of dogs that were fearful ofunfamiliar dogs/humans, as well as dogs with sound phobias, while decreased theprevalence of hiding behavior. This procedure greatly decreased incidences ofroaming, mounting and urine marking as well as the dog's overall activity. Thus, it can be concluded that while castration can resolve many undesirable behaviors in male dogs, the arguments for and against neutering should always be consideredon an individual basis.

AB  - The skin is the first barrier the body has to protect itself from theenvironment. There are several bacteria that populate the skin, and theircomposition may change throughout the dog's life due to several factors, such as environmental changes and diseases. The objective of this research was todetermine the skin microbiome changes due to a change in diet on healthy petdogs. Healthy client-owned dogs (8) were fed a fresh diet for 30 days then dryfoods for another 30 days after a 4-day transition period. Skin bacterialpopulation samples were collected after each 30-day feeding period and comparedto determine microbiome diversity. Alpha diversity was higher when dogs were fed the fresh diet compared to the dry foods. Additionally, feeding fresh food todogs increased the proportion of Staphylococcus and decreased Porphyromonas andCorynebacterium. In conclusion, changing from fresh diet to dry foods promoted a relative decrease in skin microbiome in healthy pet dogs.

LID - 10.3390/ani12151869 [doi]
AB  - The aim was to prospectively measure the shrinkage of primary apocrine gland analsac adenocarcinoma (AGASACA) tumors after 24 and 48 h of formalin fixation. Dogs that were diagnosed with AGASACA pre-operatively by aspiration cytology wereprospectively enrolled in the study. Tumor extirpation was performed in a closed technique. The tumor and associated tissues were examined on the back table away from the patient and the widest dimension of the tumor was measured using asterile ruler (Medline((R)); Northfield, IL, USA). This measurement was recorded in mm (t0). The tissue was placed in 10% buffered formalin and stored at roomtemperature. Two further measurements were taken after 24 (t24) and 48 (t48)hours of formalin fixation. Once the 48 h measurement was taken, the tissue wassubmitted for histopathology. The percentage of shrinkage between time points wascalculated by using the following equation: (1 - [time b/time a]) x 100. Overall,23 dogs with 23 tumors were enrolled. The mean percentage of shrinkage after 24and 48 h of formalin fixation was 4.8% and 7.2%, respectively. The mediandiameter of the tumors reduced by 1 mm over 48 h and was not significantlydifferent at any time point. These data will aid clinicians in interpretingmeasurements of AGASACA tumors following formalin fixation and shows that minimalchange in tumor size is expected following 48 h.

PG  - 281-288
LID - 10.2478/jvetres-2022-0019 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Dogs with chronic kidney disease (CKD) may have alterations in the glomerular filtration barrier, including podocyte loss. Detection of podocytemRNA in urine could be useful for assessing podocyturia in dogs with kidneydisease. The objective of this study was to evaluate the presence of nephrin mRNA(NPHS1) and podocin mRNA (NPHS2) in urine sediments of dogs with naturallyoccurring CKD and healthy dogs. Material and Methods: Twenty-four dogs, 14 withCKD and 10 as healthy controls, underwent clinical evaluation. The dogs with CKD were divided into two groups, according to the International Renal InterestSociety criteria: stage 1 or 2 CKD (n = 5) and stage 3 or 4 CKD (n = 9). Urinewas collected by catheterisation or free catch and RNA isolation from the urinesediments was optimised using glycogen as a co-precipitant. Detection of NPHS1and NPHS2 in the sediment samples was performed using quantitative real-time PCR.Results: Both types of mRNA were detected in samples from all groups, but thepercentages of detection were higher in the group of dogs with stage 1 or 2 CKDand lower in the group of dogs with stage 3 or 4 disease. Conclusion:Physiological podocyturia was observed in healthy dogs, and the results suggestdifferential podocyturia in dogs with CKD, according to the stage of the disease,i.e. an increase in podocyturia in dogs at stage 1 or 2 and a reduction inpodocyturia in dogs at stage 3 or 4.

AB  - Introduction: Inflammatory mammary carcinoma (IMC) is a rare disease with a poor prognosis and one affecting dogs. Inflammatory breast carcinoma (IBC) is asubtype of malignant breast cancer in humans with a high degree of malignancy anda similarly poor prognosis. Since the clinical symptoms and prognoses of both aresimilar, canine IMC has been considered as a model of human IBC. In this study,we newly established a stable IMC-derived cell line from a patient at theYamaguchi University Animal Medical Center in Japan. Material and Methods: Thepatient was a female toy poodle presenting with an inflamed mammary gland, which was diagnosed as IMC. The cell line was established from a tissue biopsy. Surfaceantigen marker (CD24 and CD44) expression was determined. Cystine/glutamateantiporter (xCT) expression was determined by Western blotting, flow cytometryand fluorescence immunostaining, and sulfasalazine was administered to ascertain if it suppressed xCT expression. Stem cell marker (Nanog, Sox2, Myc and Klf4)expression and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity were also investigated.Results: The cultured cells showed xCT, and its suppression showed downregulationof stem cell markers and ALDH activity. Stable cell proliferation was verified.Conclusion: A new canine IMC-derived cell line was established. In the future, weaim to study the effect of xCT on the maintenance of cancer stem cell properties in canine tumours, and propose a new therapeutic method for the treatment ofcanine IMC by targeting xCT.

TI  - Origins and Evolution of Seasonal Human Coronaviruses.
LID - 1551 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14071551 [doi]
AB  - Four seasonal human coronaviruses (sHCoVs) are endemic globally (229E, NL63,OC43, and HKU1), accounting for 5-30% of human respiratory infections. However,the epidemiology and evolution of these CoVs remain understudied due to theirassociation with mild symptomatology. Using a multigene and complete genomeanalysis approach, we find the evolutionary histories of sHCoVs to be highlycomplex, owing to frequent recombination of CoVs including within and betweensHCoVs, and uncertain, due to the under sampling of non-human viruses. Therecombination rate was highest for 229E and OC43 whereas substitutions perrecombination event were highest in NL63 and HKU1. Depending on the gene studied,OC43 may have ungulate, canine, or rabbit CoV ancestors. 229E may have origins ina bat, camel, or an unsampled intermediate host. HKU1 had the earliest commonancestor (1809-1899) but fell into two distinct clades (genotypes A and B),possibly representing two independent transmission events from murine-origin CoVsthat appear to be a single introduction due to large gaps in the sampling of CoVsin animals. In fact, genotype B was genetically more diverse than all the othersHCoVs. Finally, we found shared amino acid substitutions in multiple proteinsalong the non-human to sHCoV host-jump branches. The complex evolution of CoVsand their frequent host switches could benefit from continued surveillance ofCoVs across non-human hosts.

LID - 10.3390/v14071543 [doi]
AB  - Chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) caused by the hepadnavirushepatitis B virus (HBV) are significant causes of human mortality. Ahepatitis-B-like virus infecting cats, domestic cat hepadnavirus (DCH), wasreported in 2018. DCH DNA is hepatotropic and detectable in feline blood or serum(3.2 to 12.3%). Detection of HBV DNA has been reported in sera from 10% offree-roaming dogs in Brazil, whereas 6.3% of sera from dogs in Italy testedpositive for DCH DNA by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). If DCH, HBV, oranother hepadnavirus is hepatotropic in dogs, a role for such a virus in theetiology of canine idiopathic chronic hepatitis (CH) or HCC warrantsinvestigation. This study investigated whether DCH DNA could be detected via qPCRin blood from dogs in Hong Kong and also whether liver biopsies from dogs withconfirmed idiopathic CH or HCC contained hepadnaviral DNA using twopanhepadnavirus conventional PCRs (cPCR) and a DCH-specific cPCR. DCH DNA wasamplified from 2 of 501 (0.4%) canine whole-blood DNA samples. A second sampletaken 6 or 7 months later from each dog tested negative in DCH qPCR. DNAextracted from 101 liver biopsies from dogs in Hong Kong or the USA, diagnosed byboard-certified pathologists as idiopathic CH (n = 47) or HCC (n = 54), testednegative for DCH DNA and also tested negative using panhepadnavirus cPCRs. Thisstudy confirms that DCH DNA can be detected in canine blood by qPCR, although at a much lower prevalence than that reported previously. We identified no evidence to support a pathogenic role for a hepadnavirus in canine idiopathic CH or HCC.

TI  - Multiple Receptors Involved in Invasion and Neuropathogenicity of CanineDistemper Virus: A Review.
LID - 1520 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14071520 [doi]
AB  - The canine distemper virus (CDV) is a morbillivirus that infects a broad range ofterrestrial carnivores, predominantly canines, and is associated with highmortality. Similar to another morbillivirus, measles virus, which infects humans and nonhuman primates, CDV transmission from an infected host to a naive hostdepends on two cellular receptors, namely, the signaling lymphocyte activationmolecule (SLAM or CD150) and the adherens junction protein nectin-4 (also knownas PVRL4). CDV can also invade the central nervous system by anterograde spreadthrough olfactory nerves or in infected lymphocytes through the circulation, thuscausing chronic progressive or relapsing demyelination of the brain. However, theabsence of the two receptors in the white matter, primary cultured astrocytes,and neurons in the brain was recently demonstrated. Furthermore, aSLAM/nectin-4-blind recombinant CDV exhibits full cell-to-cell transmission inprimary astrocytes. This strongly suggests the existence of a third CDV receptor expressed in neural cells, possibly glial cells. In this review, we summarize therecent progress in the study of CDV receptors, highlighting the unidentifiedglial receptor and its contribution to pathogenicity in the host nervous system. The reviewed studies focus on CDV neuropathogenesis, and neural receptors mayprovide promising directions for the treatment of neurological diseases caused byCDV. We also present an overview of other neurotropic viruses to promote further research and identification of CDV neural receptors.

LID - 10.3390/v14071433 [doi]
AB  - The Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) is a piscivorous apex predator in aquatichabitats, and a flagship species of conservation biology throughout Europe.Despite the wide distribution and ecological relevance of the species, there is aconsiderable lack of knowledge regarding its virological and veterinary healthcontext, especially in Central Europe. Canine morbillivirus (Canine distempervirus (CDV)) is a highly contagious viral agent of the family Paramyxoviridaewith high epizootic potential and veterinary health impact. CDV is presentworldwide among a wide range of animals; wild carnivores are at particular risk. As part of a retrospective study, lung-tissue samples (n = 339) from Eurasianotters were collected between 2000 and 2021 throughout Hungary. The samples were screened for CDV using a real-time RT-PCR method. Two specimens proved positivefor CDV RNA. In one sample, the complete viral genome was sequenced using anovel, pan-genotype CDV-specific amplicon-based sequencing method with OxfordNanopore sequencing technology. Both viral sequences were grouped to a Europeanlineage based on the hemagglutinin-gene phylogenetic classification. In thisarticle, we present the feasibility of road-killed animal samples forunderstanding the long-term dynamics of CDV among wildlife and provide novelvirological sequence data to better understand CDV circulation and evolution.

TI  - Cytokine and Lymphocyte Profiles in Dogs with Atopic Dermatitis afterAllergen-Specific Immunotherapy.
LID - 1037 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vaccines10071037 [doi]
AB  - Canine atopic dermatitis (cAD) is a chronic and recurrent inflammatory andpruritic skin disease in dogs. Currently, allergen-specific immunotherapy (ASIT) is the only identified disease-modifying intervention for allergic diseases. Itdecreases the symptoms triggered by allergens and prevents recurrence of thedisease in the long-term. The aim of our research was to determine howimmunotherapy changes the proportion of lymphocyte subsets in dog peripheralblood and the levels of cytokines secreted by these cells during therapy. ASITwas applied for 6 months. Blood samples for further analyses were collected from patients in the third and sixth month of immunotherapy. Six out of seven dogsreceiving ASIT showed a positive effect. A reduction in cytokine levels (IL-13,TNF-alpha) in peripheral blood of cAD patients and changes in the number ofspecific T cell subpopulations-reduction of Tc cells (CD8(+)) and increase ofactivated T cells (CD3(+)CD25(+))-confirmed the beneficial effect of the applied ASIT. In addition, a significantly higher percentage of Treg cells(CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+)) was noted in cAD patients before treatment compared tohealthy dogs. After 3 months of therapy, the percentage of Tregs significantlydecreased, and after 6 months, it increased significantly again.

LID - 10.3390/s22145454 [doi]
AB  - The ability to travel (independently) is very important for participation ineducation, work, leisure activities, and all other aspects of modern life. Blind and partially sighted people experience a number of barriers to travel, includinginaccessible information and environments, and consequently require support from technology or other people to overcome them. Despite the potential of advancedtechnologies and the development of electronic travel aids, the long cane andguide dog remains the most commonly used solutions. Wearable technologies arebecoming increasingly popular. They have the particular advantage of keeping the hands free, thereby facilitating the use of a long cane, guide dog or anotherdevice at the same time. They also have the potential to change the ways in whichusers interact with the environment. The main contributions of this paper aresurveying the current state-of-the-art of travel aids from a design perspectiveand investigating the following issues: (1) The important design issues inwearable travel aids and the extent to which they are taken into account indifferent devices; (2) The relationship, if any, between where and how travelaids are worn and their design, features and functions; (3) Limitations ofexisting devices, gaps in provision and future research directions, particularly with regard to meeting potential users' needs.

TI  - Vision-Based Module for Herding with a Sheepdog Robot.
LID - 5321 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22145321 [doi]
AB  - Livestock farming is assisted more and more by technological solutions, such asrobots. One of the main problems for shepherds is the control and care oflivestock in areas difficult to access where grazing animals are attacked bypredators such as the Iberian wolf in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula. In this paper, we propose a system to automatically generate benchmarks of animalimages of different species from iNaturalist API, which is coupled with avision-based module that allows us to automatically detect predators anddistinguish them from other animals. We tested multiple existing object detectionmodels to determine the best one in terms of efficiency and speed, as it isconceived for real-time environments. YOLOv5m achieves the best performance as itcan process 64 FPS, achieving an mAP (with IoU of 50%) of 99.49% for a datasetwhere wolves (predator) or dogs (prey) have to be detected and distinguished.This result meets the requirements of pasture-based livestock farms.

TI  - Novel Esomeprazole Magnesium-Loaded Dual-Release Mini-Tablet Polycap:Formulation, Optimization, Characterization, and In Vivo Evaluation in BeagleDogs.
LID - 1411 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14071411 [doi]
AB  - Esomeprazole magnesium (EMP) is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that reduces acidsecretion. EMP has a short plasma half-life (approximately 1.3 h); hence,nocturnal acid breakthrough (NAB) frequently occurs, disturbing the patient'snighttime comfort and sleep. We aimed to develop a novel esomeprazolemagnesium-loaded dual-release mini-tablet polycap (DR polycap) with a prolongedonset time and improved bioavailability to prevent NAB. The formulation of theEPM mini-tablet core resulted in rapid drug release. The core was coated with an inner coating and an Eudragit((R)) L30D-55 aqueous dispersion coating to prepare the first-release mini-tablet. In addition, the core was coated with an innercoating and an aqueous dispersion of Eudragit((R)) S100 and Eudragit((R)) L100coating to prepare the second-release mini-tablet. Each mini-tablet type wascharacterized using an in vitro dissolution test and microscopic examination.After testing, 10 of each mini-tablets were placed together in hard capsules toform DR polycaps. The combination of mini-tablets was optimized via in vitrorelease testing and in vivo pharmacokinetic studies. The AUC0-24h of the DRpolycap was similar to that of a comparable commercial product (Nexium((R)));Cmax was lower by approximately 50%, and Tmax was extended by approximately1.7-fold. In conclusion, DR polycap is an alternative to commercial products withimproved NAB and dosing compliance because of its dual-release characteristics.

TI  - Doxorubicin-Loaded Lipid Nanoparticles Coated with Calcium Phosphate as aPotential Tool in Human and Canine Osteosarcoma Therapy.
LID - 1362 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14071362 [doi]
AB  - Osteosarcoma (OSA) is the most frequently diagnosed primary malignant bone tumor in humans and dogs. In both species, standard chemotherapy can be limited bymultidrug resistance of neoplastic cells, which prevents intracellularaccumulation of cytotoxic drugs, resulting in chemotherapy failure. In thisstudy, a lipophilic ester of doxorubicin (C12DOXO) was loaded into nanoparticles (NPs) using the "cold microemulsion dilution" method. The resulting NPs were thencoated with calcium phosphate (CaP) in two different ways to have calcium orphosphate ions externally exposed on the surface. These systems werecharacterized by determining mean diameter, zeta potential, and drug entrapmentefficiency; afterward, they were tested on human and canine OSA cells to studythe role that the coating might play in increasing both drug uptake into tumorcells and cytotoxicity. Mean diameter of the developed NPs was in the 200-300 nm range, zeta potential depended on the coating type, and C12DOXO entrapmentefficiency was in the 60-75% range. Results of studies on human and canine OSAcells were very similar and showed an increase in drug uptake and cytotoxicityfor CaP-coated NPs, especially when calcium ions were externally exposed.Therefore, applications in both human and veterinary medicine can be planned inthe near future.

TI  - Preclinical Drug Pharmacokinetic, Tissue Distribution and Excretion Profiles ofthe Novel Limonin Derivate HY-071085 as an Anti-Inflammatory and AnalgesicCandidate in Rats and Beagle Dogs.
LID - 801 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ph15070801 [doi]
AB  - Limonin is one of the research hotspots in natural drug development. However, itslow solubility in water leads to poor oral bioavailability, discouraging thefurther study of its potential as a candidate compound. In order to overcome thislimitation, and to enhance its biological activities, a novel limoninderivative-HY-071085-was synthesized by structural modification, and hasexhibited strong anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity. In order to achieve a thorough understanding of the biological actions of HY-071085 in vivo, this studyevaluated the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of HY-071085 in rats andbeagle dogs, and the distribution and excretion in rats. Usingultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, thekinetic profiles of HY-071085 in the plasma of healthy rats and beagle dogs aftera single gavage, repeated gavages and the intravenous injection of HY-071085 werestudied. The tissue distribution (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, gastrictissue, intestine, brain, skin, testis, ovary and womb) and excretion ofHY-071085 were also studied. These results showed that HY-071085 has nonlineardynamic characteristics in rat and beagle dog plasma. It was found that theplasma concentrations of HY-071085 in female rats were significantly higher than those in male rats after a single oral administration. There were genderdifferences in the kinetic behavior of HY-071085 in rats; however, there was nodifference identified in dogs. HY-071085 was mainly eliminated as metabolites in rats, and was distributed in most of the tissues except the brain, with thehighest content being in the gastric tissue and intestinal arease, followed bythe liver, spleen, fat, lung, kidney, ovary and heart. The bioavailability ofHY-071085 in male and female rats was 2.8% and 10.8%, respectively, and was about13.1% in beagle dogs. The plasma protein binding rate of HY-071085 in rats,beagle dogs and humans ranged from 32.9% to 100%, with obvious speciesdifferences. In conclusion, our study provides useful information regarding theabsorption, distribution and excretion of HY-071085, which will provide a goodbase for the study of the mechanism of its biological effects.

TI  - Molecular Survey of Bartonella Species in Stray Cats and Dogs, Humans, andQuesting Ticks from Portugal.
LID - 749 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pathogens11070749 [doi]
AB  - Bartonella spp. comprises emergent and re-emergent fastidious Gram-negativebacteria with worldwide distribution. Cats are the main reservoir hosts forBartonella henselae and dogs represent opportunistic hosts for the bacteria. Eventhough ticks may also play a role in transmission, their competence as vectorsfor Bartonella spp. has not been totally understood. Considering only a fewstudies had a focus on screening Bartonella in animals, humans and ectoparasites in Portugal, this study aimed to address the molecular occurrence of Bartonellasp. in 123 stray cats, 25 stray dogs, 30 humans from Lisbon and 236 questingticks within the country. Using a qPCR targeting the nuoG gene, it was possibleto detect Bartonella sp. DNA on 20.32% of cat samples (25/123). From thesepositive samples, 13 sequences were characterized as B. henselae, 11 as B.clarridgeiae and 1 presented co-infection with both species. The absolutequantification of nuoGBartonella DNA in sampled cats ranged from 2.78 x 10 to1.03 x 10(5) copies/microL. The sampled dogs, humans and ticks were negative.These results showed that B. henselae and B. clarridgeiae are circulating instray cats from Lisbon. Additional and more extended studies should be conducted to determine the impact of such infections on humans, particularly those inconstant and direct contact with cats.

LID - 10.3390/pathogens11070747 [doi]
AB  - Angiostrongylus vasorum, Crenosoma vulpis, Aelurostrongylus abstrusus andTroglostrongylus brevior can cause severe cardiovascular and pulmonary symptomsin companion animals and wildlife. Recently, these nematodes were reported tospread within Europe and South America. The reasons behind this are stillunknown, but obligate gastropod intermediate host populations might play a role. Therefore, lungworm infections in terrestrial slug populations in selectedgeographic areas of the Federal States of Bavaria and of Baden-Wuerttemberg,Germany, were studied. In total, 517 slugs (462 Arion spp., 51 Derocerasreticulatum, one Limax maximus, and three unknown slug species) were collected inthe summer and autumn seasons, artificially digested and microscopically andmolecularly analyzed for the presence of metastrongyloid lungworm larvae.Overall, gastropods showed a prevalence of 11.61% (60/517) for A. vasorum, 1.74% (9/517) for A. abstrusus, 0.77% (4/517) for C. vulpis and 0.97% (5/517) for T.brevior infections, respectively. In Obrigheim (Baden-Wuerttemberg), ahyperendemic focus of canine angiostrongylosis was identified. Here, gastropodinfection rates rose from 13.60% (17/125) to 62.96% (34/54) within a few months. In total, 25.61% (84/328) of analysed terrestrial gastropods fromBaden-Wuerttemberg were positive for metastrongyloids. In contrast, Bavariangastropods showed a much lower prevalence of 4.76% (9/189). For the first time,the presence of T. brevior was confirmed for Arion spp. in Baden-Wuerttemberg viamolecular analyses. Overall, the current data confirm that canineangiostrongylosis occurs in hyperendemic foci in certain geographic areas withhigh infection rates in intermediate host populations. As a result, theprevalence for a specific region can rise remarkably within a short period oftime. Thus, for a better understanding of lungworm epidemiology in Germany and toprotect dogs from angiostrongylosis in hyperendemic foci, it seems mandatory toenhance current efforts on Metastrongyloidea-targeted monitoring on ageographical and time span-related level.

LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10071446 [doi]
AB  - Canine babesiosis is an emerging and rapidly expanding tick-borne disease incentral and northeast Europe. In the last two decades, the endemic area ofBabesia canis has expanded from central Europe to the Baltic region. This studyaimed to investigate the genetic diversity of B. canis strains isolated fromnaturally infected dogs in different regions of Lithuania using PCR-RFLP andsequence analyses based on a partial region of 18S rRNA and Bc28.1 genes. Bloodsamples from 149 dogs suspected of having babesiosis were collected in Lithuania during 2016-2017. Based on PCR-RFLP profiles and two nucleotide substitutionsobserved in 18S rRNA gene sequences, three B. canis genotypes were identified in Lithuania-18S rRNA-A, 18S rRNA-B and 18S rRNA-A/B-with the A/B genotypepredominating (83.9%). Based on the obtained PCR-RFLP profiles of the Bc28.1gene, four B. canis genotypes were identified: Bc28.1-B (53.8%), Bc28.1-34(20.8%), Bc28.1-A (17.9%), and Bc28.1-34/A or B (7.5%). Sequence analysis of the partial Bc28.1 gene revealed eighteen polymorphic sites and thirteen sequencevariants among the Lithuanian samples. The B. canis genotypes obtained weredetected with varying prevalences in different regions of Lithuania.

TI  - Macronutrient Proportions and Fat Type Impact Ketogenicity and Shape theCirculating Lipidome in Dogs.

LID - 10.3390/metabo12070591 [doi]
AB  - Many physiological processes including ketogenesis are similar in dogs andhumans, but there is little information available on the effect of carbohydraterestriction in dogs. Here, the ketogenicity and serum metabolic profiles of dogs were assessed after they had consumed high carbohydrate (HiCHO); high protein,low carbohydrate (PROT_LoCHO); or high fat, low carbohydrate (FAT_LoCHO) foods.Thirty-six dogs were fed HiCHO for 4 weeks, then randomized to PROT_LoCHO orFAT_LoCHO for 5 weeks. Dogs then crossed over to the other food for an additional5 weeks. Generally, reduction of dietary carbohydrate by replacement with either protein or fat increased the energy required to maintain body weight, and fat hada greater effect. Postabsorptive energy availability derived mainly from glucose and triglycerides with HiCHO, from gluconeogenic amino acids and fatty acids withPROT_LoCHO, and from fatty acids and beta-hydroxybutyrate with FAT_LoCHO. Thisstudy demonstrated that the reduction of carbohydrate in canine foods ispotentially beneficial to dogs based on improvements in metabolism and supportsthe use of low-carbohydrate foods as safe and effective for healthy adult dogs.

TI  - Comparison of Immunodiagnostic Assays for the Rapid Diagnosis ofCoccidioidomycosis in Dogs.
LID - 728 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jof8070728 [doi]
AB  - Coccidioidomycosis is a disease caused by the dimorphic fungi Coccidioides spp., which affects humans and a variety of animal species, including domestic dogs. Indogs, accurate diagnosis could provide a substantial improvement on the qualityof canine life, as well as an advancement in the mapping of regions endemic forcoccidioidomycosis. The purpose of this study was to compare immunodiagnosticassays for anti-Coccidioides antibody (Ab) detection in dogs' serum. Threecommercially available immunodiagnostic assays (IMMY((R)); Norman, OK, USA) were evaluated, including the sona Coccidioides Ab Lateral Flow Assay (LFA),Coccidioides IDCF immunodiffusion assay (IDCF), and the Clarus Coccidioides AbEnzyme Immunoassay (EIA). Assays were evaluated using 98 dog serum samples: 29from dogs with coccidioidomycosis, 15 from dogs diagnosed with histoplasmosis, 10from dogs diagnosed with blastomycosis, and 44 from dogs without a fungaldisease. Using specimens from dogs with coccidioidomycosis, the IDCF had anaccuracy of 92% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 85-96%), the EIA had anaccuracy of 91% (95% CI = 83-96%), and the LFA displayed an accuracy of 82% (95% CI = 73-89%). Using Kappa analysis, the agreement between LFA and EIA was 0.59(95% CI = 0.42-0.75), that between LFA and IDCF was 0.64 (95% CI = 0.48-0.79),and that between EIA and IDCF was 0.79 (95% CI = 0.64-0.90). Most cross-reactionswere observed in dogs with histoplasmosis. Compared with EIA and IDCF, the LFArequires substantially less laboratory equipment and infrastructure and rapidlyproduces results, offering a substantial improvement for the initial screening ofcoccidioidomycosis in dogs.

LID - 10.3390/jof8070708 [doi]
AB  - Malassezia spp. are commensals of the skin, oral/sinonasal cavity, lowerrespiratory and gastrointestinal tract. Eighteen species have been recovered fromhumans, other mammals and birds. They can also be isolated from diverseenvironments, suggesting an evolutionary trajectory of adaption from anecological niche in plants and soil to the mucocutaneous ecosystem ofwarm-blooded vertebrates. In humans, dogs and cats, Malassezia-associateddermatological conditions share some commonalities. Otomycosis is common incompanion animals but is rare in humans. Systemic infections, which areincreasingly reported in humans, have yet to be recognized in animals. Malasseziaspecies have also been identified as pathogenetic contributors to some chronichuman diseases. While Malassezia species are host-adapted, some species arezoophilic and can cause fungemia, with outbreaks in neonatal intensive care wardsassociated with temporary colonization of healthcare worker's hands from contact with their pets. Although standardization is lacking, susceptibility testing isusually performed using a modified broth microdilution method. Antifungalsusceptibility can vary depending on Malassezia species, body location, infectiontype, disease duration, presence of co-morbidities and immunosuppression.Antifungal resistance mechanisms include biofilm formation, mutations oroverexpression of ERG11, overexpression of efflux pumps and gene rearrangementsor overexpression in chromosome 4.

TI  - Genetic Characterization of Microsporum canis Clinical Isolates in the UnitedStates.
LID - 676 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jof8070676 [doi]
AB  - Microsporum canis is the primary agent causing dermatophytosis in cats, and also infects humans, dogs, and other species. Assessment of genetic variation among M.canis isolates in the United States has not been conducted. Further, M. canismating type and assessment of disease severity associated with genotypiccharacteristics have not been rigorously evaluated. We therefore isolated M.canis from 191 domestic cats across the US and characterized genotypes byevaluation of ITS sequence, MAT locus, and microsatellite loci analysis. Thegenes SSU1 and SUB3, which are associated with keratin adhesion and digestion,were sequenced from a subset of isolates to evaluate potential geneticassociations with virulence. Analysis of microsatellite makers revealed three M. canis genetic clusters. Both clinic location and disease severity weresignificant predictors of microsatellite variants. 100% of the M. canis isolates were MAT1-1 mating gene type, indicating that MAT1-2 is very rare or extinct inthe US and that asexual reproduction is the dominant form of replication. Nogenetic variation at SSU1 and SUB3 was observed. These findings pave the way for novel testing modalities for M. canis and provide insights about transmission andecology of this ubiquitous and relatively uncharacterized agent.

TI  - The beta2-Subunit (AMOG) of Human Na(+), K(+)-ATPase Is a Homophilic AdhesionMolecule.
LID - 7753 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147753 [doi]
AB  - The beta2 subunit of Na(+), K(+)-ATPase was originally identified as the adhesionmolecule on glia (AMOG) that mediates the adhesion of astrocytes to neurons inthe central nervous system and that is implicated in the regulation of neuriteoutgrowth and neuronal migration. While beta1 isoform have been shown totrans-interact in a species-specific mode with the beta1 subunit on theepithelial neighboring cell, the beta2 subunit has been shown to act as arecognition molecule on the glia. Nevertheless, none of the works have identifiedthe binding partner of beta2 or described its adhesion mechanism. Until now, the interactions pronounced for beta2/AMOG are heterophilic cis-interactions. In the present report we designed experiments that would clarify whether beta2 is acell-cell homophilic adhesion molecule. For this purpose, we performed proteindocking analysis, cell-cell aggregation, and protein-protein interaction assays. We observed that the glycosylated extracellular domain of beta2/AMOG can make an energetically stable trans-interacting dimer. We show that CHO (Chinese HamsterOvary) fibroblasts transfected with the human beta2 subunit become more adhesive and make large aggregates. The treatment with Tunicamycin in vivo reduced cellaggregation, suggesting the participation of N-glycans in that process.Protein-protein interaction assay in vivo with MDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney)or CHO cells expressing a recombinant beta2 subunit show that the beta2 subunits on the cell surface of the transfected cell lines interact with each other.Overall, our results suggest that the human beta2 subunit can form trans-dimersbetween neighboring cells when expressed in non-astrocytic cells, such asfibroblasts (CHO) and epithelial cells (MDCK).

LID - 10.3390/genes13071223 [doi]
AB  - We investigated two litters of distantly related Nova Scotia Duck TollingRetrievers (NSDTR), of which four puppies were affected by cerebellar signs with or without neuromuscular weakness. The phenotype was termed cerebellardegeneration-myositis complex (CDMC). We suspected a heritable condition andinitiated a genetic analysis. The genome of one affected dog was sequenced andcompared to 565 control genomes. This search yielded a private protein-changingSLC25A12 variant in the affected dog, XM_038584842.1:c.1337C&gt;T, predicted toresult in the amino acid change XP_038440770.1:(p.Pro446Leu). The genotypes atthe variant co-segregated with the phenotype as expected for a monogenicautosomal recessive mode of inheritance in both litters. Genotyping of 533additional NSDTR revealed variant allele frequencies of 3.6% and 1.3% in aEuropean and a North American cohort, respectively. The available clinical andbiochemical data, together with current knowledge about SLC25A12 variants andtheir functional impact in humans, mice, and dogs, suggest the p.Pro446Leuvariant is a candidate causative defect for the observed phenotype in theaffected dogs.

AB  - An idiopathic epilepsy (IE) risk haplotype on canine chromosome (CFA) 14 has beenreported to interact with the CFA37 common risk haplotype in the Belgian shepherd(BS). Additional IE cases and control dogs were genotyped for the risk haplotypesto validate these previous findings. In the new cohort, the interaction betweenthe two regions significantly elevated IE risk. When the haplotypes were analyzedindividually, particular haplotypes on both CFA14 (ACTG) and 37 (GG) wereassociated with elevated IE risk, though only the CFA37 AA was significantlyassociated (p &lt; 0.003) with reduced risk in the new cohort. However, the CFA14ACTG risk was statistically significant when the new and previous cohort datawere combined. The frequency of the ACTG haplotype was four-fold higher in BSdogs than in other breeds. Whole genome sequence analysis revealed that a 3-base pair predicted disruptive insertion in the RAPGEF5 gene, which is adjacent to theCFA14 risk haplotype. RAPGEF5 is involved in the Wnt-beta-catenin signalingpathway that is crucial for normal brain function. Although this risk variantdoes not fully predict the likelihood of a BS developing IE, the association witha variant in a candidate gene may provide insight into the genetic control ofcanine IE.

TI  - Differential Transcriptomic Profiles Following Stimulation withLipopolysaccharide in Intestinal Organoids from Dogs with Inflammatory BowelDisease and Intestinal Mast Cell Tumor.
LID - 3525 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cancers14143525 [doi]
AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is associated with chronic intestinal inflammation andpromotes intestinal cancer progression in the gut. While the interplay betweenLPS and intestinal immune cells has been well-characterized, little is knownabout LPS and the intestinal epithelium interactions. In this study, we explored the differential effects of LPS on proliferation and the transcriptome in 3Denteroids/colonoids obtained from dogs with naturally occurring gastrointestinal (GI) diseases including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and intestinal mast celltumor. The study objective was to analyze the LPS-induced modulation of signalingpathways involving the intestinal epithelia and contributing to colorectal cancerdevelopment in the context of an inflammatory (IBD) or a tumor microenvironment. While LPS incubation resulted in a pro-cancer gene expression pattern andstimulated proliferation of IBD enteroids and colonoids, downregulation ofseveral cancer-associated genes such as Gpatch4, SLC7A1, ATP13A2, and TEX45 wasalso observed in tumor enteroids. Genes participating in porphyrin metabolism(CP), nucleocytoplasmic transport (EEF1A1), arachidonic acid, and glutathionemetabolism (GPX1) exhibited a similar pattern of altered expression between IBDenteroids and IBD colonoids following LPS stimulation. In contrast, genesinvolved in anion transport, transcription and translation, apoptotic processes, and regulation of adaptive immune responses showed the opposite expressionpatterns between IBD enteroids and colonoids following LPS treatment. In brief,the crosstalk between LPS/TLR4 signal transduction pathway and several metabolic pathways such as primary bile acid biosynthesis and secretion, peroxisome,renin-angiotensin system, glutathione metabolism, and arachidonic acid pathwaysmay be important in driving chronic intestinal inflammation and intestinalcarcinogenesis.

LID - 10.3390/cancers14143397 [doi]
AB  - Oral mucosal melanoma (OMM) is the most common oral cancer in dogs and is veryaggressive in this species; its risk factors and etiology are yet to bedetermined. This study aimed to unravel the risk factors for the development ofOMM in dogs and to investigate the possible presence of papillomaviruses as anetiological factor. A case-control study was conducted in 15 dogs with OMM and 15paired controls whose owners answered an epidemiological questionnaire. Oralswabs from the same dogs were subjected to 16S rRNA sequencing for microbiomeanalyses. In addition, DNA fragments of OMM had their DNA extracted and amplifiedby polymerase chain reaction in an attempt to detect canine papillomaviruses. Thegingiva was the most frequent anatomical site (47%) of OMM, and most tumors were stage III when diagnosed. Most dogs bearing OMM and the controls had grade 3periodontal disease, and this factor, along with tartar treatment and toothbrushing, did not differ between cases and controls. Most dogs with OMM and most controls had contact with smokers; there was no statistically significantdifference. Canine papillomaviruses were not detected among OMM cases. Tannerellaforsythia and Porphyromonas gingivalis were significantly increased in case dogs compared to the controls. As these bacteria are reportedly involved in thepathogenesis of periodontal disease and esophageal cancer in humans, we suggestthat they might be risk factors for the development of canine OMM. Thelimitations of this study include the low number of dogs, and therefore, further studies on canine OMM with larger numbers of animals are encouraged.

AB  - Campylobacteriosis seems to be a growing problem worldwide. Apart from the mostcommon sources of numerous Campylobacter species, such as poultry and other farm animals, dogs may be an underrated reservoir of this pathogen. Our goal was toestablish the frequency of occurrence, antimicrobial resistance, and detection ofchosen virulence factor genes in genomes of canine Campylobacter isolates.Campylobacter isolates frequency in dogs from shelters, and private origin was13%. All of the tested virulence factor genes were found in 28 of 31 isolates. Wedetermined high resistance levels to the ciprofloxacin and ampicillin andmoderate tetracycline resistance. For C. jejuni shelter isolates, geneticdiversity was also determined using PFGE. Our results indicate that dogs may bethe reservoir of potentially diverse, potentially virulent, andantimicrobial-resistant Campylobacter strains.

LID - 10.3390/antibiotics11070923 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/INTRODUCTION: Plasma protein binding (PPB) continues to be a keyaspect of antibiotic development and clinical use. PPB is essential to understandseveral properties of drug candidates, including antimicrobial activity,drug-drug interaction, drug clearance, volume of distribution, and therapeuticindex. Focus areas of the review: In this review, we discuss the basics of PPB,including the main drug binding proteins i.e., Albumin and alpha-1-acidglycoprotein (AAG). Furthermore, we present the effects of PPB on theantimicrobial activity of antibiotics and the current role of PPB in in vitropharmacodynamic (PD) models of antibiotics. Moreover, the effect of PPB on thePK/PD of antibiotics has been discussed in this review. A key aspect of thispaper is a concise evaluation of PPB between animal species (dog, rat, mouse,rabbit and monkey) and humans. Our statistical analysis of the data available in the literature suggests a significant difference between antibiotic binding inhumans and that of dogs or mice, with the majority of measurements from thepre-clinical species falling within five-fold of the human plasma value.Conversely, no significant difference in binding was found between humans andrats, rabbits, or monkeys. This information may be helpful for drug researchersto select the most relevant animal species in which the metabolism of a compound can be studied for extrapolating the results to humans. Furthermore,state-of-the-art methods for determining PPB such as equilibrium dialysis,ultracentrifugation, microdialysis, gel filtration, chromatographic methods andfluorescence spectroscopy are highlighted with their advantages anddisadvantages.

TI  - A Survey on the Rationale Usage of Antimicrobial Agents in Small Animal Clinicsand Farms in Trinidad and Jamaica.
LID - 885 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antibiotics11070885 [doi]
AB  - The extensive and indiscriminate use of antibiotics is known to contribute toantimicrobial resistance. Unfortunately, there are no public records ofantimicrobial use (frequency or dosage) administered to animals in two majorCARICOM (Caribbean Community) countries: Trinidad and Tobago, and Jamaica.Surveillance would promote amendments and discussion on a Caribbeanantimicrobial-use protocol. In this study, an online survey was conducted usingcross-sectional qualitative interviews via email, targeting veterinary cliniciansworking in clinics and farms in Trinidad and Jamaica, to identify howantimicrobials are used in the two countries. Out of the thirty-two (32)clinicians interviewed in Trinidad, 22 (68.75%) were small animal practitioners, and 10 (45.45%) were mixed practitioners. While in Jamaica, a total of Twenty six(26) clinicians responded, of which 17 of them (65.38%) were small animalpractitioners and nine (34.62%) were mixed practitioners. A total of 95.2% ofclinics and farms in Jamaica and 87.1% in Trinidad did not use standardantimicrobial protocols, which could be due to the limited availability ofresources. The broad-spectrum antibiotic, amoxicillin, and amoxicillin/clavulanicacid were the most commonly used drugs in small animal practices in bothcountries (71.9% and 53.8% in dogs), (78.1% and 65.9% in cats); amoxicillin isalso used frequently in mixed animal practice in Jamaica (44.4% in goats, 33.3%in cattle and 22.2% in sheep and pigs), while procaine penicillin andstreptomycin was the most frequently used in mixed practice in Trinidad (60% incattle and goats, 50% in sheep), which could explain the potentially increasedrisk of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  - p-S6 as a Prognostic Biomarker in Canine Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.
LID - 935 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biom12070935 [doi]
AB  - Scarce information exists on the role of mTOR pathway proteins and theirassociation to aggressiveness and prognosis of patients with canine oral cancers.We aimed to investigate the activated form of mTOR and its downstream S6 protein in canine oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), and to evaluate potentialassociations between protein expression and clinic-pathologic variables andsurvival. For that we analysed p-mTOR and p-S6 protein expression byimmunohistochemistry in 61 canine OSCCs. Multivariate analysis was conducted toexamine their role in patients' cancer-specific survival (CSS). p-mTOR and p-S6expression were present in almost all cases. High-expression of p-mTOR wasobserved in 44 (72.1%) cases using extent score and 52 (85.2%) cases usingintensity score. For p-S6, high expression was observed in 53 (86.9%) cases usingextent score and in 54 (88.5%) cases using intensity score. An independentprognostic value for p-S6 extension (p = 0.027), tumour stage (p = 0.013) andtreatment (p = 0.0009) was found in patients' CSS analysis. Our data suggest thatp-mTOR and p-S6 proteins are commonly expressed in canine OSCC and p-S6expression is correlated with poor CSS in dogs with OSCC. More studies should be performed to identify possible therapeutic targets related with mTOR pathway for these patients.

TI  - Patient and Caregiver Perceptions of Animal Assisted Activity in Orthodontics.
LID - 1862 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12141862 [doi]
AB  - Dental anxiety affects up to 21% of children and 80% of adults and is associated with lifelong dental avoidance. Animal assisted activity (AAA) is widely used to reduce anxiety and pain in medical settings and has promise in dentistry. Theprimary objective of this study was to evaluate caregiver and patient perceptionsof canine AAA in orthodontics. A cross-sectional survey consisting of pre-tested and validated questions was conducted (n = 800) including orthodontic patients (n= 352 minors, n = 204 adults) and parents/caregivers (n = 244) attendinguniversity orthodontic clinics. In this study, AAA and dog therapy were not used or tested for dental anxiety management. More than a third of orthodonticpatients (37%) had moderate or greater anxiety related to care. Participantsbelieved that therapy animals would make dental experiences more enjoyable (75%) and reduce anxiety (82%). There was little to no concern expressed regardingcleanliness (83%), allergies (81%), and safety (89%) with a therapy animal indental settings. Almost half of the participants would preferentially select anorthodontic office offering AAA. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we assessedwhether perceptions of AAA changed before and after the shutdown of dentaloffices, with no significant differences. Across patients and caregivers, theresponses support the use of AAA in orthodontic settings with minimal concerns.

LID - 1844 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12141844 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to estimate the safety, feasibility, and efficacyof the intra-articular treatment of autologous microfragmented adipose tissue in dogs with spontaneous osteoarthritis (OA) in comparison with hyaluronic acid(HA), the standard intra-articular treatment. Specifically, it clinicallyevaluated pain and lameness, the radiographic progression of osteoarthritis, and synovial fluid inflammation. This was a prospective, single-center,parallel-group, randomized, controlled, in vivo clinical study. Participants (n =40) received either a single intra-articular injection of microfragmented adiposetissue or a single intra-articular injection of HA (1:1). Clinical outcomes were determined using a specialistic clinician assessment obtained by the completionof a specific clinical form based on the Vesseur modified lameness classificationsystem, a pain evaluation using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the measurement of the range of motion (ROM) of the affected joint, limb circumference, and theowners' score evaluation using the Canine Brief Pain Inventory (CBPI) for up to 6months after the time of injection. Patients underwent a radiographic examinationto establish the degree of OA in the affected joint, and synovial fluid sampleswere collected to assess the biochemical environment of the joint and evaluateand quantify the cellular population and the presence of three specificinflammation biomarkers for up to 60 days. The results of this study suggest thatmicrofragmented autologous adipose tissue is safe and can effectively relievepain and improve function in dogs with spontaneous articular OA. This one-stepprocedure is simple, timesaving, cost-effective, minimally invasive, andeliminates the need for complex and time-intensive cell culture processing.Furthermore, the clinical evidence and cytological results suggest betterlong-term pain control, resulting in an improvement in joint function, comparedto HA treatment. The canine spontaneous OA model could play a key role indeveloping successful treatments for human medicine.

LID - 1832 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12141832 [doi]
AB  - Allergy is a malfunction of the immune system that causes an inappropriatereaction to normally harmless substances known as allergens, such as foodcomponents, pollen, parasites, mites, medication, etc. It is very important tomake a correct diagnosis, to identify and to eliminate the offending allergenfrom the body, and provide control and long-term management to achieve acomfortable life for the animal. In the case of highly intensive pruritus, drugs such as glucocorticoids, antihistamines, and Janus kinase inhibitors aregenerally administered. Unfortunately, common drugs are not always able toresolve the problem. This comparative clinical-outcomes study focused on theapplication of alternatives, where a combination of acupuncture with phytotherapyand nutrition was applied. These traditional methods do not affect the body only symptomatologically; instead, they treat the patient as a whole. In this clinicalstudy, the therapeutic effects and partial or complete stabilization of theallergic condition of fourteen dogs divided into two groups were observed,compared, and evaluated.

AB  - In this paper, we report the first molecular detection of the canine distempervirus in the Marsican brown bear (Ursus arctos marsicanus). Three subadults andone adult were live-trapped and checked for the main viral pathogens responsible for infectious diseases in this species. The four bears were found to be negativefor all investigated viruses except for one, which resulted in a positive outcomefor CDV by means of RT-PCR targeting fragments of viral N and H genes. Thesequence analysis revealed the specificity of amplicons for the Europe Wildlifelineage of CDV, the same viral strain recovered from three foxes and twounvaccinated dogs coming from the same territories where the positive bear wascaptured. These results confirm the receptivity of Marsican brown bear for CDV,apparently without any pathological consequences for the positive animal, andsuggest the presence in the studied area of a unique wild host-adapted lineage ofthe virus, able to spread in domestic animals, too. In this respect, continuousand specifically targeted surveillance systems are necessary in order tohighlight any changes in the epidemiology of the infection in the territorieswhere the Marsican brown bear lives, along with a more effective vaccinationprogram for domestic dogs co-existing with this endangered species.

TI  - Routine Decontamination of Surfaces Relevant to Working Dogs: Neutralization ofSuperficial Coronavirus Contamination.
LID - 1823 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12141823 [doi]
AB  - Given the increased deployment of working dogs to settings with pathogenicbiological agents, a safe, effective, and logistically feasible surfacedecontamination protocol is essential to protect both the animals and their humanhandlers. Our group previously found that superficial contamination on surfacesrelevant to the working dog community, including leashes and toys, could besignificantly reduced using a standardized wiping protocol with various cleansingproducts. To expand upon this work, we analyzed the ability of this protocol todecontaminate surface-deposited bovine coronavirus, which was used as a BSL2surrogate for SARS-CoV-2. Unsurprisingly, the physical characteristics of a givensurface, including porosity and texture, had a significant effect on the ability to recover viable virus remaining on the surface post treatment. After correctingfor these differences, however, wiping with 70% isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and 0.5% chlorhexidine performed best, reducing viral titers by &gt;3 log on plasticbumper toys and nylon collars, and by &gt;2 log on rubber toys and tennis balls. Leather leashes and Velcro proved more difficult to decontaminate, but both stillshowed significant loss of viral contamination following wiping with IPA orchlorhexidine. This work (i) validates the utility of a simple protocol for theneutralization of viruses on several surfaces, (ii) identifies materials that aremore difficult to decontaminate, which should, thus, be considered for removalfrom field use, and (iii) highlights the need for further development ofprotocols testing porous or textured surfaces.

TI  - Effect of Vaccination against Leptospira on Shelter Asymptomatic Dogs Following aLong-Term Study.
LID - 1788 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12141788 [doi]
AB  - (1) Background: Vaccination of dogs against leptospirosis is of paramountimportance, as they ideally must provide not only long-term protection, but also against the renal carrier state of leptospires. This study assessed thepost-vaccine humoral response against Leptospira in naturally exposed dogs andeffects on renal carrier status. (2) Methods: A total of 118 dogs were studiedfor 365 days, separated into Group A (vaccinated, n = 94) and Group B(non-vaccinated, n = 24). Group A was subdivided into three groups: A1 with 32dogs immunized with the vaccine #1; A2 by 32 dogs with #2; and A3 30 dogs with#3. Serology (MAT and IgG-ELISA) and urinary PCR were conducted. (3) Results:Seroreactivity increased at D15 post-vaccination and, regardless of vaccinebrand, remained high up to D180, with antibody switch to IgG after D30. A totalof 46.8% of animals from Group A were PCR-positive at least once, in contrast to 75% in Group B, regardless of vaccine brand (p &lt; 0.05; OR: 0.3). (4)Conclusions: All commercial vaccines succeeded at eliciting a long-term IgG-basedresponse and were partially effective at protecting against kidney infection.

AB  - The aim of this prospective, randomized, nonblinded, controlled clinical trialwas to compare mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) during anintravenous bolus of three different balanced isotonic crystalloid solutions ineuvolemic, anesthetized dogs with hypotension. Thirty healthy dogs (AmericanSociety of Anesthesiologists Physical Status I-II) weighing at least 15 kg thatpresented for elective orthopedic or dental surgical procedures at the RyanVeterinary Hospital for Small Animals of the University of Pennsylvania wereincluded in this study. Anesthetized hypotensive patients (defined as a MAP </=65 mmHg), were administered an infusion of Lactated Ringer's solution (LRS),Plasma-Lyte (PLYTE) or Canadian Plasma-Lyte (PLYTECA), selected at random. Theinfusion was administered over 15 min via a volumetric fluid pump. Differences inoscillometric MAP and HR between time points and across treatments were evaluatedby mANOVA. Intravenous isotonic crystalloid infusions over 15 min did notsignificantly change MAP or HR in hypotensive dogs under general anesthesia.Neither LRS, PLYTE nor PLYTECA exacerbated hypotension or caused tachycardia.

TI  - The Differences in Histoarchitecture of Hoof Lamellae between Obese and LeanDraft Horses.

LID - 10.3390/ani12141774 [doi]
AB  - Obesity is a common problem in horses. The associations between obesity andequine metabolic syndrome (EMS) and between EMS and laminitis are known. However,there is a lack of data on whether obesity itself can affect hoof lamellae.Forelimbs and blood from 12 draft horses (six obese and six lean) from aslaughterhouse were acquired. To exclude laminitis and EMS horses, insulinconcentration was measured, and hooves were radiographed. Histological evaluationwas performed. The shape of the primary and secondary epidermal lamellae (PEL andSEL) was evaluated, and the length of the keratinized and total primary epidermallamellae was measured (KPEL and TEL). All horses showed pathological changes inlamellae. In the lean group, the changes were longer SELs, more proliferated and separated PDLs, and less standard PDLs. In the obese group, the changes were alower number of club-shaped and standard SELs and significantly more taperedSELs. No difference in the shape of PELs and the length of KPELs was noticed. Theresearch did not confirm the effects of obesity on lamellar failure. Themeasurements taken indicate that the lamellae are much longer compared to otherresearch studies; this could indicate that the length of the PEL depends on thehoof size.

LID - 10.3390/ani12141760 [doi]
AB  - Physiotherapy is a new dynamically developing field of science in which theoriginal idea was to improve the care for convalescent patients. Its positiveeffects observed in humans suggested the need for the adaptation andimplementation of human physiotherapy techniques in animal care. Dogs are thesecond group of animals that undergo physiotherapy most frequently. These animalsare diagnosed with a number of locomotor system problems, which may be congenitaland are often related to the breed or acquired. The aim of the study was tocollect and systematize knowledge of animal physiotherapy with emphasis on theselection and description of the most important aspects of canine physiotherapy. The review material consisted of 59 publications, with 230 selected for thereview. Physiotherapeutic treatments are applied not only for rehabilitation ofanimals but also in healthy animals to upgrade their sports performance andimprove their welfare. A majority of physiotherapeutic approaches have beentransferred from human protocols. A key issue in the achievement of therapysuccess is the proper selection of physiotherapeutic procedures and closecooperation between the veterinarian and the physiotherapist.

LID - 10.3390/ani12141759 [doi]
AB  - One of the main concerns of the human-dog relationship is today associated withthe quality life inside the kennels, which are very often regarded as animal dumpwhere dogs are exiled, representing a burden on society. In the present study we sought to investigate the importance of performing an appropriate behavioralprogram on the adoption chances within an Italian shelter, near Naples(Ottaviano). In this respect, we enrolled 555 adopted dogs of different ages, whofollowed a tailored-4-month lasting training program between 2018 and 2020. Once entered there, they were carefully examined by the veterinary behaviorist, anddirected towards a suited training program, to improve living conditions. Wedocumented a higher number of both adult and senior dogs who left the kennel and were adopted, compared to the age-matched untrained animals (n = 479), housed in the same kennel from 2015 to 2017. Taken together, the present data highlight an important role for training in improving the natural attitudes of the companiondogs, thus pointing towards a better human-animal bond.

TI  - Development of an Artificial Neural Network for the Detection of SupportingHindlimb Lameness: A Pilot Study in Working Dogs.
LID - 1755 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12141755 [doi]
AB  - Subjective lameness assessment has been a controversial subject given the lack ofagreement between observers; this has prompted the development of kinetic andkinematic devices in order to obtain an objective evaluation of locomotor system in dogs. After proper training, neural networks are potentially capable of makinga non-human diagnosis of canine lameness. The purpose of this study was toinvestigate whether artificial neural networks could be used to determine canine hindlimb lameness by computational means only. The outcome of this study couldpotentially assess the efficacy of certain treatments against diseases that causelameness. With this aim, input data were obtained from an inertial sensorpositioned on the rump. Data from dogs with unilateral hindlimb lameness andsound dogs were used to obtain differences between both groups at walk. Theartificial neural network, after necessary adjustments, was integrated into a webmanagement tool, and the preliminary results discriminating between lame andsound dogs are promising. The analysis of spatial data with artificial neuralnetworks was summarized and developed into a web app that has proven to be auseful tool to discriminate between sound and lame dogs. Additionally, thisenvironment allows veterinary clinicians to adequately follow the treatment oflame canine patients.

LID - 10.3390/ani12141753 [doi]
AB  - Optimal sleep duration and quality is difficult to define. There are strongarguments for a relationship between sleep, in particular REM sleep, andemotional health and behaviour in a variety of species. This study aims tobroaden the level of knowledge regarding canine sleep durations andcharacteristics and begin research into the relationship between behaviouralresponses and the duration and quality of sleep. A caregiver questionnaire wasused to capture information regarding the duration and characteristics of canine sleep, how easily this cohort of dogs were disturbed from sleep, and caregiverperceptions of the severity of problem behaviours shown by this cohort (n =1330). A quadratic relationship between canine sleep duration whilst a caregiver is in bed and severity of problem behaviour is shown, with less than 8 h sleepand more than 10 h sleep correlating with increased severity of problembehaviours in this cohort. Dogs which were more easily disturbed from sleep attimes their caregiver was out of bed, showed increased reported severity ofproblem behaviours. Whilst it is not possible to determine an optimal caninesleep duration, sufficient evidence is presented to argue that problem behaviour should not be remedied by sleep deprivation.

AB  - The Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line is an in vitro model for influenzaA virus (IAV) infection and propagation. MDCK-SIAT1 (SIAT1) and humanized MDCK(hCK) cell lines are engineered MDCK cells that express N-glycans with elevatedlevels of sialic acid (Sia) in alpha2,6-linkage (alpha2,6-Sia) that arerecognized by many human IAVs. To characterize the N-glycan structures in thesecells and the potential changes compared to the parental MDCK cell line resultingfrom engineering, we analyzed the N-glycans from these cells at differentpassages, using both mass spectrometry and specific lectin and antibody binding. We observed significant differences between the three cell lines in overallcomplex N-glycans and terminal galactose modifications. MDCK cells express corefucosylated, bisected complex-type N-glycans at all passage stages, in additionto expressing alpha2,6-Sia on short N-glycans and alpha2,3-Sia on largerN-glycans. By contrast, SIAT1 cells predominantly express alpha2,6-Sia glycansand greatly reduced level of alpha2,3-Sia glycans. Additionally, they expressbisected, sialylated N-glycans that are scant in MDCK cells. The hCK cellsexclusively express alpha2,6-Sia glycans. Unexpectedly, hCK glycoproteins boundrobustly to the plant lectin MAL-1, indicating alpha2,3-Sia glycans, but suchbinding was not Sia-dependent and closely mirrored that of an antibody thatrecognizes glycans with terminal 3-O-sulfate galactose (3-O-SGal). The 3-O-SGalepitope is highly expressed in N-glycans on multiple hCK glycoproteins. Theseresults indicate vastly different N-glycomes between MDCK cells and theengineered clones that could relate to IAV infectivity.

LID - 10.1007/s00784-022-04642-3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop a new preclinical model to study early implant loss, wherelocal infection conditions would impair the implant osseointegration. MATERIALSAND METHODS: Forty-eight smooth, 2.9-mm diameter experimental implants wereplaced in the mandible of 8 beagle dogs (3 in each side). In half of the animals (test group, n = 24 implants), the implants received ligatures around theimplant-abutment connection. In the other half, no ligatures were placed (controlgroup, n = 24 implants). Four weeks later, implants were extracted in a flapless approach and standard 3.3-mm diameter SLActive implants were placed into the sameosteotomy site without any further drilling. Eight weeks after the secondimplantation, animals were sacrificed and analyzed in terms of implant survival. RESULTS: After 8 weeks of healing, 4 implants were lost in the control group and 14 in the test group. This corresponded to a 17.4% of early implant loss in thecontrol group and 58.3% in the test. Most of the early failures occurred withinthe first 5 weeks of healing. CONCLUSIONS: Implants placed in a pre-contaminated site present higher early loss than those placed in a non-contaminated site. Thisstudy represents a valid and robust preclinical model to study mechanisms andreduction of early implant loss as new technologies become available. CLINICALRELEVANCE: Scientific rationale for the study: There is lack of animal models to study early implant loss. Thus, a proposal of a new model is presented. With the validation of this model, new technologies can be implemented to prevent earlyimplant loss.

PG  - 446-470
LID - 10.1111/vec.13227 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To systematically review available evidence and establish guidelines related to the use of thrombolytics for the management of small animals withsuspected or confirmed thrombosis. DESIGN: PICO (Population, Intervention,Control, and Outcome) questions were formulated, and worksheets completed as partof a standardized and systematic literature evaluation. The population ofinterest included dogs and cats (considered separately) and arterial and venousthrombosis. The interventions assessed were the use of thrombolytics, compared tono thrombolytics, with or without anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents. Specificprotocols for recombinant tissue plasminogen activator were also evaluated.Outcomes assessed included efficacy and safety. Relevant articles werecategorized according to level of evidence, quality, and as to whether theysupported, were neutral to, or opposed the PICO questions. Conclusions from thePICO worksheets were used to draft guidelines, which were subsequently refinedvia Delphi surveys undertaken by the Consensus on the Rational Use ofAntithrombotics and Thrombolytics in Veterinary Critical Care (CURATIVE) working group. RESULTS: Fourteen PICO questions were developed, generating 14 guidelines.The majority of the literature addressing the PICO questions in dogs isexperimental studies (level of evidence 3), thus providing insufficient evidence to determine if thrombolysis improves patient-centered outcomes. In cats,literature was more limited and often neutral to the PICO questions, precludingstrong evidence-based recommendations for thrombolytic use. Rather, for bothspecies, suggestions are made regarding considerations for when thrombolyticdrugs may be considered, the combination of thrombolytics with anticoagulant orantiplatelet drugs, and the choice of thrombolytic agent. CONCLUSIONS:Substantial additional research is needed to address the role of thrombolyticsfor the treatment of arterial and venous thrombosis in dogs and cats. Clinicaltrials with patient-centered outcomes will be most valuable for addressingknowledge gaps in the field.

TI  - Nonclinical Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of Desidustat: a Novel Prolyl Hydroxylase Inhibitor for the Treatment of Anemia.
LID - 10.1007/s13318-022-00788-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Desidustat is a novel prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) inhibitor for the treatment of anemia. The objective of this study was toinvestigate the pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interaction properties ofdesidustat using in vitro and in vivo nonclinical models. METHODS: In vitro,Caco2 cell permeability, plasma protein binding, metabolism, cytochrome P450(CYP) inhibition, and CYP induction were examined. In vivo, pharmacokineticstudies of oral bioavailability in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys, dose linearity, tissue distribution, and excretion in rats were conducted. RESULTS: In Caco-2cells, the apparent permeability of desidustat was high at low pH and low atneutral pH. The oral bioavailability (%F) of desidustat was 43-100% with a mediantime to reach peak concentration (Tmax) of about 0.25-1.3 h across species.Desidustat displayed a low mean plasma clearance (CL) of 1.3-4.1 mL/min/kg(approximately 1.8-7.4% of hepatic blood flow), and the mean steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) was 0.2-0.4 L/kg (approximately 30-61% of the total bodywater). Desidustat showed a dose-dependent increase in exposures over the 15-100 mg/kg dose range. It was rapidly distributed in various tissues, with the highesttissue-to-blood ratio in the liver (1.8) and kidney (1.7). Desidustat showed highplasma protein binding and was metabolically stable in human liver microsomes,hepatocytes, and recombinant CYPs. It did not show significant inhibition ofmajor drug-metabolizing CYP enzymes (IC50 > 300 microM) or the potential toinduce CYP1A2 and CYP3A4/5 (up to 100 microM) in HepG2 cells. It may have minimalpotential of clinical drug-drug interaction when used in combination with ironsupplements or phosphate binders. Desidustat was primarily excreted unchanged in urine (25% of the oral dose) and bile (25% of the oral dose) in rats. The meanelimination half-life of desidustat ranged from 1.0 to 5.3 h and 1.3 to 5.7 hacross species after intravenous and oral administration, respectively.CONCLUSION: Taken together, desidustat is well absorbed orally. It showed adose-dependent increase in exposure, did not accumulate in tissue, and waseliminated via dual routes. It is metabolically stable, has minimal potential to cause clinical drug-drug interactions (DDIs), and demonstrates discriminablepharmacokinetic properties for the treatment of anemia.

TI  - Coinfection with canine distemper virus and canine circovirus in a dog in Brazil.
LID - 10.1007/s42770-022-00803-4 [doi]
AB  - Canine distemper virus (CDV) and canine circovirus (CanineCV) have been describedworldwide in multi-systemic disease in dogs. Both agents may be occasionallyassociated with other viral pathogens, but reports of coinfection by CDV andCanineCV associated with disease are rare. In this article, we report acoinfection between CDV and CanineCV detected during an investigation of viralagents involved in multisystemic disease in dogs in Southern Brazil. Moleculartesting by PCR in lungs and intestines of 77 dogs necropsied in pathologyservices (2015-2020) revealed several single and mixed viral infections,including a CDV/CanineCV coinfection. In the case reported here, gross andhistological findings were compatible with CDV pathology (bronchointerstitialpneumonia and viral intracytoplasmatic inclusions in pneumocytes and transitionalepithelial cells of urinary bladder). CanineCV DNA and CDV antigens were detectedin lung and intestine fragments by PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively.CanineCV PCR amplicons subjected to nucleotide sequencing showed > 98.6%nucleotide identity with CanineCV sequences from GenBank. Although the role ofCanineCV in the pathogenesis of the reported case could not be determined, ourresults show that CanineCV may be associated with other viral infections in casesof multisystemic disease in dogs. These results reinforce the circulation ofCanineCV in dogs in Brazil and highlight the importance of including this virusin the list of differential diagnoses of respiratory and gastroenteric infectiousdiseases in dogs.

TI  - Cardiorespiratory nematodes and co-infections with gastrointestinal parasites in new arrivals at dog and cat shelters in north-western Spain.
LID - 10.1111/tbed.14670 [doi]
AB  - Metastrongyloid and trichuroid cardiorespiratory nematodes of dogs and cats areconsidered emergent in several European countries, and an increase in the number and extent of endemic foci has been described. Since data on their prevalence is limited in this continent, faecal samples from new arrivals (365 dogs and 65cats) at two animal shelters in North-western Spain were analysed using bothfloatation and Baermann techniques. In order to confirm the microscopicidentification of Metastrongylidae first stage larvae, molecular characterizationbased on the sequence of the ITS-2 was performed. The possible influence of some variables such as the species, sex and age of the animals and the co-infectionwith other gastrointestinal parasites on the prevalence of cardiorespiratorynematodes was analysed. The most prevalent metastrongylid was Aelurostrongylusabstrusus (15.4%) followed by Angiostrongylus vasorum (4.1%) and Crenosoma vulpis(1.1%). Regarding trichuroids, Eucoleus aerophilus and/or Eucoleus boehmi eggswere detected in 28 dogs (7.7%) and four cats (6.2%). Almost all animals positiveto cardiorespiratory nematodes (86.8%) were co-infected with gastrointestinalparasites. The prevalence of Metastrongylidae and respiratory trichuroids wassignificantly higher in dogs co-infected with Taenia spp. and Toxocara canis orGiardia duodenalis and Sarcocystis spp., respectively. In cats, a significanthigher prevalence of Metastrongylidae nematodes was found in animals co-infected with Toxocara cati. Our results reveal that cardiorespiratory nematodes arecommon in companion animals from north-western Spain, showing higher prevalences than those previously reported from this country. This investigation representsthe first report of C. vulpis, E. aerophilus and E. boehmi in dogs from Spain.The identification of a number of zoonotic parasites is of public health concern.Our results indicate that these nematodes should be included in the differential diagnosis of dogs and cats from north-western Spain showing respiratory orcardiac clinical signs.

TI  - Serum metabolomic profiles in dogs with chronic enteropathy.
LID - 10.1111/jvim.16419 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Metabolic profiles differ between healthy humans and those withinflammatory bowel disease. Few studies have examined metabolic profiles in dogs with chronic enteropathy (CE). HYPOTHESIS: Serum metabolic profiles of dogs with CE are significantly different from those of healthy dogs. ANIMALS: Fifty-fivedogs with CE and 204 healthy controls. METHODS: A cross-sectional study. Theserum concentrations of 99 metabolites measured using a canine-specific protonnuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy platform were studied. A 2-sampleunpaired t-test was used to compare the 2 study samples. The threshold forsignificance was set at P < .05 with a Bonferroni correction for each metabolite group. RESULTS: Nineteen metabolites and 18 indices of lipoprotein compositionwere significantly different between the CE and healthy dogs. Four metaboliteswere significantly higher in dogs with CE, including phenylalanine (mean and SD) (healthy: 0.0417 mmol/L; [SD] 0.0100; CE: 0.0480 mmol/L; SD: 0.0125; P value:<.001) and lactate (healthy: 1.8751 mmol/L; SD: 0.7808; CE: 2.4827 mmol/L; SD CE:1.4166; P value: .003). Fifteen metabolites were significantly lower in dogs withCE, including total fatty acids, and glycine (healthy: 0.2273 mmol/L; SD: 0.0794;CE: 0.1828 mmol/L; SD CE: 0.0517; P value: <.001). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICALIMPORTANCE: The metabolic profile of dogs with CE is significantly different fromthat of healthy dogs, this opens novel research avenues to develop betterdiagnostic and prognostic approaches as well as therapeutic trials.

LID - 10.4014/jmb.2206.06004 [doi]
AB  - The skin, which is the largest organ of the human body, is in direct contact withpollutants in the surrounding atmosphere. Meanwhile, 1-nitropyrene (1-NP), themost abundant nitro-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon found in particulate matter, is known to have carcinogenic effects; however, studies on its toxicity in human and canine skin are still needed. In this study, we investigated 1-NP-inducedapoptosis and inflammatory pathways in HaCaT cells. In addition, we also measuredthe cytoprotective effect of methyl gallate (MG), which is widely distributed in medicinal and edible plants and is well known for its anti-inflammatory andantioxidant properties. MG inhibited 1-NP-induced cell death and apoptosispathways, including the cleavage of PARP and activation of caspase-3, -7, and -9.MG also suppressed 1-NP-induced COX-2 expression and phosphorylation ofmitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and MAPK kinases (MAPKKs). Our findingssuggest that 1-NP induces skin toxicity in human and canine through apoptosis andinflammatory responses, and moreover, that this can be prevented by treatmentwith MG.

TI  - ACVIM consensus statement on diagnosis and management of acute caninethoracolumbar intervertebral disc extrusion.
LID - 10.1111/jvim.16480 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thoracolumbar intervertebral disc extrusion (TL-IVDE) is the mostcommon cause of acute paraparesis and paraplegia in dogs; however, guidelines on management of the condition are lacking. OBJECTIVES: To summarize the currentliterature as it relates to diagnosis and management of acute TL-IVDE in dogs,and to formulate clinically relevant evidence-based recommendations. ANIMALS:None. METHODS: A panel of 8 experts was convened to assess and summarize evidencefrom the peer-reviewed literature in order to develop consensus clinicalrecommendations. Level of evidence available to support each recommendation wasassessed and reported. RESULTS: The majority of available literature describedobservational studies. Most recommendations made by the panel were supported by alow or moderate level of evidence, and several areas of high need for furtherstudy were identified. These include better understanding of the ideal timing forsurgical decompression, expected surgical vs medical outcomes for more mildlyaffected dogs, impact of durotomy on locomotor outcome and development ofprogressive myelomalacia, and refining of postoperative care, and genetic andpreventative care studies. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Future effortsshould build on current recommendations by conducting prospective studies andrandomized controlled trials, where possible, to address identified gaps inknowledge and to develop cost effectiveness and number needed to treat studiessupporting various aspects of diagnosis and treatment of TL-IVDE.

AB  - The concentration of calprotectin in feces (fCal) is a clinically useful markerof chronic gastrointestinal inflammation in humans and dogs. No commercial assay is widely available to measure fCal in small animal medicine, to date. Thus, weverified the immunoturbidimetric fCAL turbo assay (Buhlmann) of fCal for canineand feline fecal extracts by determining linearity, spiking and recovery, andintra-assay and inter-assay variability. We determined RIs, temporal variationover 3 mo, and effect of vaccination and NSAID treatment. Observed:expected (O:E)ratios (x +/- SD) for serial dilutions of feces were 89-131% (106 +/- 9%) in dogsand 77-122% (100 +/- 12%) in cats. For spiking and recovery, the O:E ratios were 90-118% (102 +/- 11%) in dogs and 83-235% (129 +/- 42%) in cats. Intra- andinter-assay CVs for canine samples were </=19% and </=7%, and for feline samples </=22% and </=21%. Single-sample RIs were <41 mug/g for dogs and <64 mug/g forcats. With low reciprocal individuality indices, using population-based fCal RIs is appropriate, and moderate fCal changes between measurements (dogs 44.0%; cats:43.2%) are considered relevant. Cats had significant (but unlikely relevant) fCalincreases post-vaccination. Despite individual fCal spikes, no differences wereseen during NSAID treatment. The fCAL turbidimetric assay is linear, precise,reproducible, and sufficiently accurate for measuring fCal in dogs and cats.Careful interpretation of fCal concentrations is warranted in both species duringthe peri-vaccination period and for some patients receiving NSAID treatment.

TI  - Effects of mechanical washing and drying on the removal of pet allergens.
LID - 10.2500/aap.2022.43.220029 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Korea, the number of households with indoor pets is rapidlyincreasing in parallel with changes in culturallifestyles. The sensitization rateof pet allergens is also increasing in Korea. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated theeffectiveness of washing machines to remove dog and cat hair and their allergens.In addition, thisstudy aimed to investigate whether only a mechanical dryerwithout mechanical washing could be used for pet allergen removal. METHOD: Webrushed cats and dogs, and thereafter collected their hair and used a residentialvacuum cleaner to obtain dust and other particulate matter from a household. The contents of the vacuum bag were sifted through a 300-mm sieve filter. Some of thecontents were placed in phosphate-buffered saline solution with 0.5% Tween 20 to make a liquid extract. Hair, dust, and liquid extract-contaminated fabric samplesafter mechanical washing or after drying without mechanical washing were analyzedfor pet allergens (Fel d l [cat], Can f 1 [dog]) by using a two-siteenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We assessed the remaining allergens in thecontaminated fabrics after mechanical drying and washing. RESULTS: The mean Fel dl and mean Can f 1 removal ratios after mechanical washing with detergent were > 99.99% for the dust, hair, and liquid extract. The removal ratios aftermechanical washing without a detergent were lower for both Fel d 1 and Can f 1,for hair, dust, and their respective liquid extracts (p < 0.05). Mechanicaldrying was just as effective as mechanical washing with detergent for removingCan f 1 but was less effective for Fel d 1 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Mechanicalwashing with detergent is important to remove pet allergens from contaminatedfabrics. If washing is difficult, then using just a dryer without washing can be an alternative method to remove allergens from contaminatedbedding or clothing.

AB  - Serum bile acids concentrations rise postprandially. However, some dogs showparadoxical serum bile acids results with higher pre-prandial than post-prandial concentrations. The aim of this study was to evaluate serum cholecystokinin (CCK)concentrations and determine whether they correspond to paradoxical serum bileacids concentrations. In addition, seeing and smelling food was investigated as apossible cause for paradoxical serum bile acids results. Eight healthy dogs ownedby volunteers enrolled in this experimental study. Food was withheld from thedogs for 12 h with great care not to expose them to any sight or smell of food.Blood samples were collected at 0, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 480 and 720 min afterfeeding. Food was then withheld again for 24 h, and blood samples were collected at 0, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 480 and 720 min after seeing and smelling food.After feeding, serum CCK concentrations increased, but paradoxical serum CCKconcentrations were observed in some of dogs, but only one of those had alsoparadoxical serum bile acids concentrations. After seeing and smelling food,serum CCK and serum bile acids concentrations did not significantly increase. In conclusion, paradoxical serum CCK concentrations can occur in some healthy dogsafter feeding. However, no correlation with paradoxical serum bile acidsconcentrations was found. Seeing or smelling food are unlikely causes forparadoxical serum bile acids concentrations. Additional studies are warranted to further evaluate the relationship of serum CCK and bile acids concentrations inhealthy dogs and dogs with gastrointestinal disease.

AB  - A discrepancy between cytology and bacterial culture methods is sometimesobserved in canine otitis externa. The objective of this study was to compareresults from cytology, bacterial culture and 16S amplicon profiling. Twentysamples from 16 dogs with chronic suppurative otitis externa were collected. Adirect cytological evaluation was carried out during the consultations. Aerobicbacterial culture and susceptibility were performed by an external laboratoryused in routine practice. For 16S amplicon profiling, DNA was extracted and thehypervariable segment V1-V3 of the 16S rDNA was amplified and then sequenced witha MiSeq Illumina sequence carried out by the Mothur software using the SILVAdatabase. A good correlation between cytology and bacterial culture was observed in 60% of the samples. Some bacterial species revealed by bacterial culture were present with low relative abundance (&lt;10%) in 16S amplicon profiling. Somebacterial species revealed by the 16S amplicon profiling analysis were notidentified with culture; most of the time, the offending species was aCorynebacterium. To conclude, a careful interpretation of the results ofbacterial culture should be made and always be in agreement with the cytology.The 16S amplicon profiling method appears to be a more sensitive method fordetecting strains present in suppurative otitis but does not provide information on bacterial susceptibility.

LID - 10.3390/vetsci9070345 [doi]
AB  - As in humans, the prevalence of tumors in companion animals is increasingdramatically and there is a strong need for research on new pharmacologicalagents particularly for the treatment of those tumors that are resistant toconventional chemotherapy agents such as soft tissue sarcomas (STS). Becausemalignant (MPNST) and benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors (BPNST) arerelatively common STS in dogs, the aim of this retrospective study was toevaluate the immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of PDGFR-beta, contributing to its characterization as a potential target for their treatment. A total of 19samples were included, 9 histologically classified as benign and the other 10 as malignant. The results showed diffuse immunoexpression in the cytoplasm ofneoplastic cells. Six (66.7%) BPNST expressed the receptor in less than 25% ofneoplastic cells and only three (33.3%) exhibited labelling in more than 25% ofneoplastic cells. In contrast, all MPNST expressed PDGFR-beta, and in 8 (80%) of these samples, the receptor was expressed in more than 25% of neoplastic cells,and only 2 (20%) cases expressed the receptor in less than 25% of neoplasticcells. PDGFR-beta expression was significantly higher in MPNST and larger tumors,suggesting that drugs able to inhibit the activity of this tyrosine kinasereceptor, such as toceranib, may be considered in the approach of unresectabletumors and/or in the context of adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapies.

TI  - Identification of Histopathological Criteria for the Diagnosis of CanineCutaneous Progressive Angiomatosis.
LID - 340 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vetsci9070340 [doi]
AB  - The term angiomatosis is used to denote a group of well-known to poorlycharacterized proliferative vascular entities. In animals, cutaneous progressive angiomatosis (CPA) is a disorder with variable prognosis related to the extensionand depth of infiltration of the surrounding tissues by vessels. CPA may sharesome microscopical features with other vascular proliferations such as low-grade well-differentiated capillaritic hemangiosarcoma (HS), making the diagnosis notalways straightforward, especially in small biopsies. The aim of this study is toretrospectively assess the most common diagnostic microscopical features of CPAin dogs. In this work, 11 histopathological criteria were analyzed on 31 CPA and 11 primary cutaneous HS in dogs. Features significantly associated with CPAincluded: lobular growth, interposition of connective tissue and adnexa betweenthe vascular proliferation, presence of nerve fibers, and a mixed vascularproliferative component. Absence of plump/prominent endothelial cells, lack ofatypia, and lack of mitoses were also significant factors differentiating CPAfrom HS. Additional distinctive findings in CPA, although with no statisticalassociation to CPA diagnosis, were vascular shunting, absence of necrosis, andendothelial cell piling up. In conclusion, the combined use of differentmicroscopical clues allowed for the distinction of CPA from HS and was considereduseful for the diagnosis of CPA.

TI  - Physiotherapy Improves Dogs' Quality of Life Measured with the Milan Pet Quality of Life Scale: Is Pain Involved?
LID - 335 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vetsci9070335 [doi]
AB  - Quality of life is defined as an individual's satisfaction with its physical and psychological health, its physical and social environment, and its ability tointeract with the environment. Understanding companion dogs' QOL can helpveterinarians and owners know when treatment options have successfully alleviatedsymptoms of disease in such fields as veterinary physiotherapy. For this study,20 adult dogs were selected from patients of a physiotherapy referral center withorthopedic, neurological, and/or degenerative conditions. The severity of themedical problem was ranked, and the symptoms, the treatment plan, and demographicdata were recorded at the time of the physical examination. In addition, theowner of the dog was asked to fill out a questionnaire on the quality of life of the pet (the Milan Pet Quality of Life scale) at the time of the firstconsultation as well as the last follow-up after the treatment. The MPQL measuresfour domains of QOL: physical (signs of medical conditions), psychological(emotional and behavioral well-being), social (quality and extent of socialinteractions), and environmental (freedom and safety in one's environment). Theresults of the study indicated a significant improvement in the psychological QOLdomain following physiotherapeutic treatment. The social QOL domain declined withthe severity of lameness, while the physical QOL, as reported by the owner,declined with the overall criticality of the medical condition, as ranked by the physiotherapist. The results of the study support the recent evidence of arelationship between pain and canine psychological well-being and highlight theimportance of investigating psychological and emotional aspects of dogs' QOL whentreating orthopedic and neurological cases with physiotherapy.

TI  - Essential and Non-Essential Amino Acids in Dogs at Different Stages of ChronicKidney Disease.
LID - 331 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vetsci9070331 [doi]
AB  - Abnormalities of serum amino acid profile, mostly characterized by a reduction inessential amino acids (EAAs) and an increase in non-essential amino acids(NEAAs), have been documented in human chronic kidney diseases (CKD). Amino acid disorders have been associated with CKD complications, such as metabolic acidosisand malnutrition. The aim of the present study was to evaluate EAAs and NEAAs in dogs affected by CKD at different IRIS stages, with particular reference tocalcium-phosphate abnormalities, metabolic acidosis, and protein-energy wastingsyndrome (PEW). Serum EAAs (L-histidine, L-isoleucine, L-leucine, L-lysine,methionine, L-phenylalanine, L-threonine, tryptophan, L-valine, and L-arginine)and serum NEAAs (L-alanine, L-aspartic acid, L-cysteine, L-glutamic acid,glycine, proline, L-serine, and L-tyrosine) were analyzed with HPLC in a group ofdogs with CKD (n = 62), and in a group of healthy dogs (n = 25). CKD dogs showed significantly lower serum levels of histidine (p &lt; 0.000), isoleucine (p &lt; 0.000), tryptophan (p &lt; 0.000), alanine (p = 0.013), cysteine (p &lt; 0.000), and serine (p = 0.002), and significantly higher levels of proline (p &lt;0.000), leucine (p = 0.001), lysine (p &lt; 0.000), valine (p &lt; 0.000),arginine (p = 0.002), glutamic acid (p = 0.002), and glycine (p = 0.010) comparedto healthy dogs. Dogs with abnormal calcium x phosphate values showedsignificantly higher levels of cysteine (p = 0.003), and lower levels oftryptophan (p = 0.025) compared to CKD dogs with normal CaxP. Dogs with metabolicacidosis showed significantly higher levels of phenylalanine (p = 0.035) andleucine (p = 0.034) compared to CKD dogs without metabolic acidosis. Dogs withPEW showed significantly lower levels for most of amino acids. In PEW dogs, themedian distribution of both EAAs (p = 0.000) and NEAAs (p = 0.001) wassignificantly lower. The serum pattern of both EAAs and NEAAs was significantlydifferent in CKD dogs compared to healthy dogs, although no association with the progression of the IRIS stage was found.

LID - 329 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vetsci9070329 [doi]
AB  - Skin barrier dysfunction is important in atopic dermatitis and can be secondaryto inflammation. Observation of keratinocytes in culture may show intrinsicdifferences. TransEpithelial Electrical Resistance (TEER) measures epithelialpermeability. We cultured normal and atopic keratinocytes and found that TEER of atopic keratinocytes was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.0001) than that ofnormals. Atopic keratinocytes grew upwards, first creating isolated dome-likestructures and later horizontally into a monolayer. At time of confluence (D0),atopic keratinocytes were more differentiated, with higher filaggrin geneexpression than normals. No differences existed between groups for TJ proteins(claudin, occludin, and Zonula Occludens-1) on D0 and D6. On D6, claudin andoccludin were higher than D0, in normal (p = 0.0296 and p = 0.0011) and atopickeratinocytes (p = 0.0348 and 0.0491). Immunofluorescent staining showed nuclear location of filaggrin on D0 and cytoplasmic on D6. ANOVA showed increased cellsize from D0 to D6 in both groups (effect of time, p = 0.0076) but no differencesbetween groups. Significant subject effect (p = 0.0022) was found, indicatingthat cell size was subject-dependent but not disease-dependent. No difference forcontinuity for TJ protein existed between groups. These observations suggest thatdecreased TEER in atopics is not linked to TJ differences but is possibly linked to different growth behavior.

LID - 327 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vetsci9070327 [doi]
AB  - The use of oncolytic viruses is an innovative approach to lyse tumor cells andinduce antitumor immune responses. Eight dogs diagnosed withcarcinoma/adenocarcinoma were intratumorally treated with ICOCAV15, an oncolytic canine adenovirus (CAV). To evaluate the treatment's safety, a blood count,biochemistry, and coagulation test were performed before treatment and duringfollow-up. Immune populations were analyzed by flow cytometry. Anti-adenovirusantibodies were also determined. The immune infiltration, vascularization, andviral presence in the tumor were determined by CD3, CD4, CD20, CD31 and CAV byimmunohistochemistry. All the dogs maintained a good quality of life duringfollow-up, and some had increased median survival time when compared with dogstreated with chemotherapy. No treatment-related adverse effects were detected.The Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors criteria were also assessed: twopatients showed a partial response and the rest showed stable disease at various times during the study. ICOCAV15 was detected inside the tumor during follow-up, and antiviral antibodies were detected in all patients. Furthermore, thetumor-infiltrating immune cells increased after viral administration. Therefore, we suggest that intratumorally administered ICOCAV15 could represent as a newtool for the treatment of canine carcinoma because it is safe, well-tolerated by dogs, and shows promising results.

LID - 326 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vetsci9070326 [doi]
AB  - Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is a very frequently acquired cardiacdisease in dog breeds and is responsible for congestive heart failure (CHF). The involvement of the immune system and pro-inflammatory cytokines in dogs with CHF due to mitral valve disease has not yet been extensively investigated. Here, weinvestigate the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the dysfunction of theimmune system in dogs with different stages of severity through the bloodassessment of CD4(+)FoxP3(+)regulatory T cells (Treg) cells, leptin, tumornecrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6 pro-inflammatorycytokines, and immunological and echocardiographic parameters. A total of 36cardiopathic dogs, 14 females and 22 males, with MMVD were included. Mean age andbody weight (BW) at the time of enrollment were 10.7 +/- 2.77 years and 10.9 +/- 6.69 kg, respectively. For the comparison of the pro-inflammatory andimmunological parameters, two groups of healthy dogs were also established.Control group 1 consisted of young animals (n. 11; 6 females and 5 males), whose age and mean weight were 4.1 +/- 0.82 years and 13.8 +/- 4.30 kg, respectively.Control group 2 consisted of elderly dogs (n. 12; 6 females and 6 males), whoseage and BW were 9.6 +/- 0.98 years and 14.8 +/- 6.15 kg, respectively. Ofparticular interest, an increase in Treg cells was observed in the cohort of MMVDdogs, as compared to the healthy dogs, as Treg cells are involved in themaintenance of peripheral tolerance, and they are involved in etiopathogeneticand pathophysiological mechanisms in the dog. On the other hand, TNF-alpha,IL-1beta, and IL-6 significantly increased according to the severity of thedisease in MMVD dogs. Furthermore, the positive correlation between IL-6 and the left ventricle diastolic volume suggests that inflammatory activation may beinvolved in cardiac remodeling associated with the progressive volumetricoverload in MMVD.

AB  - Force plate analysis assesses gait symmetry and limb loading. However, aspreviously described, individual and breed variability (body size andconformation) is related to breeding, body conformation, and size. Thisprospective study aimed to evaluate the influence of morphometric measures on thespeed (V), peak of vertical force (PVF), vertical impulse (VI), and stance time(ST) in healthy dolichomorph and mesomorph dogs and their combined effect on and interactions with V, PVF, VI, and ST in the same morphological types. Fifty dogs were enrolled in the current study, and specific morphometric measurements wererecorded for each dog. A force platform was used to record the ground reactionforces (GFRs), including PVF and VI. Multiple linear regression models were used for the study purposes. According to our results, GFRs are influenced bymorphometric measures (body weight, withers height, and speed) not so much as asingle contribution, but by the interaction between them. It is not possible tocompare GFRs in dogs that do not belong to the same breed. However, thesubjective variabilities make this comparison difficult and poorly reliable.According to the author, the comparison should be made between caninemorphological types rather than breeds.

LID - 10.3390/vetsci9070324 [doi]
AB  - Antibiotics cause gut dysbiosis and bile acid dysmetabolism in dogs. The effectof fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on microbiome and metabolome recoveryis unknown. This prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study includedsixteen healthy purpose-bred dogs. All dogs received tylosin 20 mg/kg PO oncedaily (days 1-7) and were randomly assigned to either receive one FMT via enema(day 8), daily oral FMT capsules (days 8-21), or daily placebo capsules (days8-21). Fecal samples were frozen at regular intervals until day 42. Quantitative PCR for 8 bacterial taxa was performed to calculate the fecal dysbiosis index(FDI) and fecal concentrations of unconjugated bile acids (UBA) were measuredusing gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Tylosin altered the abundance of mostevaluated bacteria and induced a significant decrease in secondary bile acidconcentrations at day 7 in all dogs. However, most parameters returned to theirbaseline by day 14 in all dogs. In conclusion, tylosin markedly impacted fecalmicrobiota and bile acid concentrations, although return to baseline values wasquick after the antibiotic was discontinued. Overall, FMT did not acceleraterecovery of measured parameters. Further studies are warranted to confirm thevalue of FMT in accelerating microbiota recovery in antibiotic-associateddysbiosis in dogs.

LID - 10.3390/vetsci9070323 [doi]
AB  - Filaggrin is an epidermal protein involved in skin barrier formation andhydration, whose expression is altered in canine atopic dermatitis (CAD). CADpatients also present an abnormal immune response with an altered expression ofantimicrobial peptides (AMPs), such as beta-defensins and cathelicidins.Sphingolipids and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) have been reported to improve theskin barrier in several animal species, including dogs. Our objective was toevaluate the in vitro effects of a sphingomyelin-rich lipid extract (LE), ahyaluronic acid-rich GAG matrix, and their combination, on the expression offilaggrin and human beta-defensin 2 (hBD-2). Filaggrin expression was quantified in a reconstructed human epidermis (RHE), and hBD-2 in normal human epidermalkeratinocyte (NHEK) cultures. LE and GAGs were tested at 0.02 mg/mL, with orwithout adding a cytokine mix. A significant increase in mean hBD-2, compared to the control (99 pg/mL) was achieved with LE (138 pg/mL) and LE+GAGs (165 pg/mL). Filaggrin increased with GAGs (202% +/- 83) and LE (193% +/- 44) vs. thestimulated control, but this difference was statistically significant (p &lt;0.05) only with LE+GAGs (210% +/- 39). In conclusion, the tested GAGs and LEenhance filaggrin and AMP expression in vitro, which might benefit CAD patientsif applied in vivo.

LID - 10.3390/vetsci9070310 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study is to report the results and to review the outcome of 14cases of Y-T humeral fractures repair using paired polyaxial locking system (PAX)plates through a combined medial and lateral approach. Fourteen consecutive dogs,with traumatic humeral Y-T fractures, met the inclusion criteria. This studyincludes signalment, preoperative radiographs, type of implants, radiographicbone healing assessment, complications, range of motion (ROM) of the elbow andlimb function evaluated at 120 days after surgery. Postoperative radiographsrevealed adequate anatomic reconstruction, and in all cases, bone healing hasbeen achieved. No implant failure was observed. Functional outcome was excellent in 7 dogs (no lameness and preserved ROM), good in 4 (slight lameness andmoderate ROM reduction) and discrete in 2 (mild lameness and severe ROMreduction). Complications were encountered in 2/14 patients withimplant-associated infection resolved after long-term antibiotic treatment andimplant removal. The PAX system is shown to be a valid alternative for thetreatment of Y-T humeral fractures, offering the benefit of polyaxial insertionof locking screws. The possibility of angle locking screws is helpful in thedistal humeral bicondylar fractures, providing additional options for screwplacement in juxtarticular fractures, avoiding fracture lines or other implants.

TI  - Risk Factors for Antimicrobial Resistance of Staphylococcus Species Isolated fromDogs with Superficial Pyoderma and Their Owners.
LID - 306 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vetsci9070306 [doi]
AB  - The microbial communities on the skin of dogs include several species ofbacteria, which contribute to skin health and disease. Staphylococcuspseudintermedius, cultured at high frequency from the skin of dogs, is anopportunistic pathogen causing superficial pyoderma. Effective treatment against S. pseudintermedius infections is an important issue in veterinary medicine.However, multiple antibiotic-resistant mechanisms gradually developed by bacteriamake treatment more challenging nowadays. Drug-resistant genes may have thechance to be transferred from infected dogs to other staphylococci in humans. Theobjective of this survey is to investigate the bacterial species that causecanine superficial pyoderma and characterize the antibiotic-resistant profilesand drug-resistant genes of isolated S. pseudintermedius. In addition, thepossible risk factors causing S. pseudintermedius colonizing owners were alsoevaluated by a questionnaire survey. Sixty-five bacteria were isolated from dogs with superficial pyoderma, which included 47 S. pseudintermedius (72.3%), 12other staphylococci (18.5%), 4 other Gram-positive bacteria (6.2%) and 2Gram-negative bacteria (3.1%). Strains containing mecA and blaZ genes showedmultiple-drug resistance characteristics. Dogs that received antimicrobialtreatment within a recent month were at significantly higher risk of MRSPinfections. Only five S. pseudintermedius strains (8.33%) were isolated from 60samples of owners. Risk factor analysis indicated there was no significantassociation between S. pseudintermedius isolated from dogs and owners, but the"Keeping three or more dogs" and "Dogs can lick the owner's face" have high odds ratios of 3.503 and 5.712, respectively. MRSP isolates belonged to threedifferent dru types, including dt11y (29.41%), dt11a (47.06%) and dt10cp(23.53%). In conclusion, the major pathogen of canine superficial pyoderma isfound to be S. pseudintermedius in Taiwan, and isolates which are mecA- orblaZ-positive are generally more resistant to commonly used antibiotics. AlthoughS. pseudintermedius isolated from the owners might be transferred from theirdogs, definite risk factors should be examined in the future study.

AB  - Beauvericin (BEA) is a well-known mycotoxin produced by many fungi, includingBeaveria bassiana. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the invitro&amp;nbsp;distribution and metabolism characteristics as well as the in vivopharmacokinetic (PK) profile of BEA. The in vitro metabolism studies of BEA were performed using rat, dog, mouse, monkey and human liver microsomes, cryopreservedhepatocytes and plasma under conditions of linear kinetics to estimate therespective elimination rates. Additionally, LC-UV-MS(n) (n = 1~2) was used toidentify metabolites in human, rat, mouse, dog and monkey liver microsomes.Furthermore, cytochrome P450 (CYP) reaction phenotyping was carried out. Finally,the absolute bioavailability of BEA was evaluated by intravenous and oraladministration in rats. BEA was metabolically stable in the liver microsomes and hepatocytes of humans and rats; however, it was a strong inhibitor of midazolam1'-hydroxylase (CYP3A4) and mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylase (CYP2C19) activities inhuman liver microsomes.&amp;nbsp;The protein binding fraction values of BEA were &gt;90% and the half-life (T1/2) values of BEA were approximately 5 h in theplasma of the five species. The absolute bioavailability was calculated to be29.5%. Altogether, these data indicate that BEA has great potential for furtherdevelopment as a drug candidate. Metabolic studies of different species canprovide important reference values for further safety evaluation.

TI  - Employing deep convolutional neural networks for segmenting the medialretropharyngeal lymph nodes in CT studies of dogs.
LID - 10.1111/vru.13132 [doi]
AB  - While still in its infancy, the application of deep convolutional neural networksin veterinary diagnostic imaging is a rapidly growing field. The preferred deeplearning architecture to be employed is convolutional neural networks, as theseprovide the structure preferably used for the analysis of medical images. Withthis retrospective exploratory study, the applicability of such networks for the task of delineating certain organs with respect to their surrounding tissues was tested. More precisely, a deep convolutional neural network was trained tosegment medial retropharyngeal lymph nodes in a study dataset consisting of CTscans of canine heads. With a limited dataset of 40 patients, the network inconjunction with image augmentation techniques achieved an intersection-overunionof overall fair performance (median 39%, 25 percentiles at 22%, 75 percentiles at51%). The results indicate that these architectures can indeed be trained tosegment anatomic structures in anatomically complicated and breed-relatedvariating areas such as the head, possibly even using just small training sets.As these conditions are quite common in veterinary medical imaging, all routines were published as an open-source Python package with the hope of simplifyingfuture research projects in the community.

AB  - The raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) is known to be an opportunisticgeneralist who feeds on a wide variety of foods. Historically, their diet hasbeen investigated by morphological observation of undigested remains in feces,requiring specialized knowledge such as osteology, zoology, and phytology. Here, we used DNA metabarcoding of vertebrate 12S rRNA gene and invertebrate 16S rRNAgene to investigate their fecal contents. Additionally, we developed a blockingoligonucleotide that specifically inhibits the amplification of the canid 12SrRNA gene. We confirmed that the blocking oligonucleotide selectively inhibit theamplification of raccoon dog's DNA without significantly changing the compositionof the preys' DNA. We found that the main foods of raccoon dogs in our studyarea, the waterside of paddy fields in Korea, were fishes such as Cyprinidae and insects such as mole crickets, which makes sense given the Korean fauna and theirwell-known opportunistic feeding behaviors. As a method to conveniently andobjectively investigate feeding habits of raccoon dogs, this study providedbaseline information on DNA metabarcoding. By using DNA metabarcoding, it isexpected that the diet habits and ecology of raccoon dogs will be betterunderstood by future research.

TI  - Parent and child mental health during COVID-19 in Australia: The role of petattachment.
PG  - e0271687
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0271687 [doi]
AB  - Restrictions, social isolation, and uncertainty related to the global COVID-19pandemic have disrupted the ways that parents and children maintain familyroutines, health, and wellbeing. Companion animals (pets) can be a criticalsource of comfort during traumatic experiences, although changes to familyroutines, such as those caused by COVID-19, can also bring about challenges like managing undesirable pet behaviours or pet-human interactions. We aimed toexamine the relationship between pet attachment and mental health for bothparents and their children during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. A total of 1,034 parents living with a child under 18 years and a cat or dog completed anonline cross-sectional survey between July and October 2020. Path analysis using multivariate linear regression was conducted to examine associations betweenobjective COVID-19 impacts, subjective worry about COVID-19, human-petattachment, and mental health. After adjusting for core demographic factors,stronger pet-child attachment was associated with greater child anxiety(parent-reported, p < .001). Parent-pet attachment was not associated withself-reported psychological distress (p = .42), however, parents who reported astrong emotional closeness with their pet reported greater psychological distress(p = .002). Findings highlight the role of pets during times of change anduncertainty. It is possible that families are turning to animals as a source ofcomfort, during a time when traditional social supports are less accessible.Alternatively, strong pet attachment is likely to reflect high levels of empathy,which might increase vulnerability to psychological distress. Longitudinalevidence is required to delineate the mechanisms underpinning pet attachment and mental health.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0269974 [doi]
AB  - Attention is a central process of cognition and influences the execution of dailytasks. In humans, different types of work require different attentional skillsand sport performance is associated with the ability to attention shift.Attention towards humans varies in dogs used for different types of work. Whetherthis variation is due to the recruitment of individuals suitable for specifictypes of work, or to the characteristics of the work, remains unclear. In thepresent study, we hypothesized that domestic horses (Equus caballus) trained for different types of work would also demonstrate different attentionalcharacteristics but we also explored other possible factors of influence such as age, sex and breed. We exposed more than sixty horses, working in 4 differentdisciplines, and living in two types of housing conditions, to a visual attentiontest (VAT) performed in the home environment. Individual attentionalcharacteristics in the test were not significantly influenced by age, sex, breed or conditions of life but were strongly related to the type of work. Ridingschool horses showed longer sequences and less fragmented attention than allother horses, including sport horses living in the same conditions.Interestingly, sport performance was correlated with attention fragmentationduring the test in eventing horses, which may need more attention shifting duringthe competitions. Working conditions may influence attention characteristicsindirectly through welfare, or directly through selection and training. Our studyopens new lines of thought on the determinants of animal cognition and itsplasticity and constitutes a further step towards understanding theinterrelationship between working conditions and cognition.

PG  - 301-305
LID - 10.1645/21-108 [doi]
AB  - New antibabesial drugs are required to fight resistant parasites, andplant-derived natural products are a robust source. Six kinds of natural product extracts derived from herbal medicines that are traditionally used for thetreatment of malaria were selected to test the antibabesial effect on Babesiagibsoni in vitro and in vivo. Parasitized blood was collected from dogs infected with B. gibsoni to evaluate the inhibitory effect of verbenalin, catechinhydrate, dihydrolycorine, embelin, ursolic acid, agrimol B, and bruceine H invitro. The expression levels of the 18S rRNA gene in all drug-treated groups weredetermined by relative quantification using a real-time PCR method. Significantinhibition of the in vitro growth of B. gibsoni was observed after treatment bythose natural product extracts (200 nM concentration) (P < 0.05). Catechinhydrate showed the highest activity in vitro due to the lowest expression levels of the 18S rRNA gene. The IC50 value of catechin hydrate against B. gibsoni was273 nM. In B. gibsoni infected dogs, intravenous administrations of catechinhydrate and diminazene aceturate showed significant (P < 0.05) inhibition of B.gibsoni growth at a dose of 11 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively, compared to the control group. The results of our study may suggest that catechin hydrate may be a promising alternative to treat canine babesiosis caused by B. gibsoni.

AB  - Pet dogs with naturally-occurring cancers play an important role in studies ofcancer biology and drug development. We assessed tolerability, efficacy andpharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships with a first-in-class smallmolecule inhibitor of valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97), CB-5339, administeredto 24 tumor-bearing pet dogs. Tumor types assessed included solid malignancies,lymphomas, and multiple myeloma. Through a stepwise dose and schedule escalation schema, we determined the maximum tolerated dose to be 7.5 mg/kg whenadministered orally on a 4-days on, 3-days off schedule per week for 3consecutive weeks. Adverse events were minimal and mainly related to thegastrointestinal system. PK/PD data suggests a relationship between exposure and modulation of targets related to induction of the unfolded protein response, but not to tolerability of the agent. An efficacy signal was detected in 33% (2/6)dogs with multiple myeloma, consistent with a mechanism of action relating toinduction of proteotoxic stress in a tumor type with abundant protein production.Clinical trials of CB-5339 in humans with acute myelogenous leukemia and multiplemyeloma are ongoing.

AB  - Discovery of insulin. If the symptoms of diabetes have been known sinceAntiquity, it is at the end of the 19th century that several investigatorssearched for the active substance of the pancreas and endeavoured to produceextracts that lowered blood and urine glucose and decreased polyuria inpancreatectomized dogs. The breakthrough came 100 years ago when the team ofFrederick Banting, Charles Best and James Collip, working in the Department ofPhysiology, headed by John MacLeod at the University of Toronto, managed toobtain pancreatic extracts that could be used to treat patients and rescue themfrom the edge of death by starvation, the only treatment then available. Thisachievement was quickly recognized by the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicineto Banting and MacLeod in 1923. The discovery has had important scientific,industrial and clinical developments still efficient nowadays.

TI  - Evaluation of clonality from multiple anatomic sites in canine epitheliotropic T cell lymphoma.
LID - 10.1111/vde.13106 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Canine epitheliotropic cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (eCTCL) is thoughtto represent a disease homologue to human mycosis fungoides (MF). In human MF,neoplastic cells are phenotypically consistent with resident effector memory Tcells, a population that remains for an extended period within tissue withoutcirculating. Dogs with eCTCL often present with lesions in multiple locations,raising the question of whether the neoplasm is of the same T-cell subpopulation or not. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the antigen receptor gene rearrangements oflymphocytes from skin and blood of dogs with eCTCL to determine if neoplasticclones are identical. ANIMALS: Fourteen dogs with eCTCL. MATERIALS AND METHODS:Histological and immunohistochemical examination, and PCR for antigen receptorrearrangement (PARR) for T-cell receptor gamma (TRG) performed on multiplecutaneous biopsy samples and blood. RESULTS: All skin biopsies contained cluster of differentiation (CD)3-positive neoplastic lymphocytes. Within individual dogs,all skin biopsies revealed identical TRG clonality profiles, suggesting that the same neoplastic clone was present in all sites. In the blood, a matching clonewas found in six of 14 dogs, a unique clone was observed in nine of 14 dogs, and no clone was detected in two of 14 dogs. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show thatcanine eCTCL lesions in multiple locations harbour the same neoplastic clone,neoplastic lymphocytes do not remain fixed to the skin and instead can circulate via blood, differing clones can be identified in skin versus blood, andcirculating neoplastic cells can be detected without lymphocytosis.

AB  - Cutaneous mast cell tumor (MCT) is one of the most frequent cutaneous neoplasmsof dogs and may vary from well-differentiated to aggressive tumors withmetastasis. The authors retrospectively described the gross and histologicaspects of metastatic MCT in 49 dogs. Primary MCT was most commonly identified inthe inguinal region (14/35; 40%), and at necropsy multiple, cutaneous noduleswere frequently reported (23/49; 47%). All primary MCT were classified ashigh-grade neoplasms, and metastases involved the lymph nodes (47/49; 96%),spleen (33/49; 67%), liver (29/49; 59%), bone marrow (20/49; 41%), kidneys(16/49; 33%), and heart (14/49; 29%), while the lungs were less commonly affected(9/49; 18%). The main gross findings included lymphadenomegaly in 47 cases;splenomegaly in 28 cases, with splenic nodules in 13 dogs; hepatomegaly in 28cases, with white pinpoint foci in 9 cases; nodules on the capsular surface ofthe kidneys in 9 dogs; and epicardial nodules in 6 cases. Histologically, thelymph nodes were largely obliterated by neoplastic mast cells, while in thespleen, neoplastic cells were multifocally scattered (16/33; 48%), arranged innodules (10/33; 30%), or obliterated the parenchyma (9/33; 27%). In the liver,the neoplastic cells mainly infiltrated the sinusoids (24/29; 83%), but were alsoarranged in random nodules (10/29; 34%). Interstitial and nodular metastases wereobserved in the kidneys and the heart. Grossly unapparent metastases were common in the heart (6/14; 43%), kidneys (4/16; 25%), and lungs (6/9). KIT III and KITII staining patterns were observed in 29 and 20 cases, respectively.

AB  - Objective: To develop an evidence map on visceral leishmaniasis prevention,control, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Methods: Systematic reviews onvisceral leishmaniasis were searched using MEDLINE/PubMed and Virtual HealthLibrary. After selection, each included systematic review was assessed,characterized, and categorized by intervention type and by outcomes, according tothe methodology offered by the PAHO/WHO Latin American and Caribbean Center onHealth Sciences Information (BIREME). The methodological quality was assessedusing the AMSTAR2 tool to determine the confidence level of the evidenceobtained. Results: Among the prevention and control interventions, insecticidespraying, bednets, dog collars, and dog culling were the most assessed,emphasizing that insecticidal dog collars can reduce visceral leishmaniasisincidence in dogs. Regarding diagnosis, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), rK39immunochromatographic test (rK39 ICT), and direct agglutination test (DAT)presented high sensitivity and specificity. As for treatment, pentavalentantimonials and amphotericin B were the most analyzed drugs and showedtherapeutic success; however, serious adverse events can occur due to their use. The prognostic factors identified were anemia, edema, bleeding, jaundice, age,and HIV coinfection. Conclusions: The evidence map developed shows rK39 ICT andDAT as promising diagnostic alternatives and reinforces the efficacy of liposomalamphotericin B and pentavalent antimonials. Insecticide-impregnated dog collarsappear as a promising measure for the control of visceral leishmaniasis, butthere is also a need for future studies and reviews with higher methodologicalquality, especially on prevention and control interventions.

TI  - Pregabalin Add-On vs. Dose Increase in Levetiracetam Add-On Treatment: AReal-Life Trial in Dogs With Drug-Resistant Epilepsy.
PG  - 910038
LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.910038 [doi]
AB  - Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder affecting 0.6-0.75% of dogs inveterinary practice. Treatment is frequently complicated by the occurrence ofdrug-resistant epilepsy and cluster seizures in dogs with idiopathic epilepsy.Only few studies are available to guide treatment choices beyond licensedveterinary drugs. The aim of the study was to compare antiseizure efficacy andtolerability of two add-on treatment strategies in dogs with drug-resistantidiopathic epilepsy. The study design was a prospective, open-label, non-blinded,comparative treatment trial. Treatment success was defined as a 3-fold extension of the longest baseline interseizure interval and to a minimum of 3 months. Toavoid prolonged adherence to a presumably ineffective treatment strategy, dogowners could leave the study after the third day with generalized seizures if theinterseizure interval failed to show a relevant increase. Twenty-six dogs (meanage 5.5 years, mean seizure frequency 4/month) with drug-resistant idiopathicepilepsy and a history of cluster seizures were included. Dogs received eitheradd-on treatment with pregabalin (PGB) 4 mg/kg twice daily (14 dogs) or a doseincrease in levetiracetam (LEV) add-on treatment (12 dogs). Thirteen dogs in the PGB group had drug levels within the therapeutic range for humans. Two dogs inthe PGB group (14.3%; 2/14) and one dog in the LEV group (8.3%; 1/12) achievedtreatment success with long seizure-free intervals from 122 to 219 days but then relapsed to their early seizure frequency 10 months after the study inclusion.The overall low success rates with both treatment strategies likely reflect areal-life situation in canine drug-resistant idiopathic epilepsy in everydayveterinary practice. These results delineate the need for research on betterpharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatment strategies in dogs withdrug-resistant epilepsy.

TI  - A Prospective Cohort Study Investigating the Behavioural Development of Bitchesin a Guide Dog Training Programme Neutered Prepubertally or Post-Pubertally.

AB  - There are few studies that investigate the effect of neutering bitches before or after puberty. The majority of current literature examining the impact of thetiming of neutering on health and behaviour has used age rather than the onset ofpuberty as the key variable. The aim of this prospective cohort study was toinvestigate the effects of timing of neutering in relation to puberty onbehaviour in female dogs reared and trained in an assistance dog programme. Thestudy examined data for bitches neutered before or after puberty to comparescores for six behavioural factors (training and obedience, aggression, fear and anxiety, excitability, attachment and attention-seeking, and social behaviour)measured at 1 and 3 years of age. Labrador and Golden Retriever crossbreedbitches were neutered before (n = 155) or after (n = 151) puberty. Neuteringbefore or after puberty had no impact on mean scores for the six behaviouralfactors at 1 or 3 years of age. When examining the change in behavioural factorscores between 1 and 3 years of age, only aggression behavioural factor scoreswere influenced by neutering before or after puberty. Bitches neutered afterpuberty were less likely to have aggression factor scores that increased between 1 and 3 years of age (OR = 0.959, 90% CI = 0.924 to 0.995, p = 0.06). However,the majority of bitches scored "0" for aggression at both time points (indicatingno aggression behaviours were observed), and the number of bitches for whichscores increased between 1 and 3 years of age was low (before puberty = 20, afterpuberty = 9). This is consistent with very mild aggressive behaviours beingobserved in a small number of animals and is, therefore, of questionable concern.The results suggest that, for Labrador and Golden Retriever crossbreed bitches,neutering before or after puberty has little to no effect on future behaviour. Itis recommended that decisions about the timing of neutering are not informedsolely by impacts on behaviour, but that they also consider evidence relating to the impacts on bitch health and well-being.

TI  - Commercial Extruded Plant-Based Diet Lowers Circulating Levels of Trimethylamine N-Oxide (TMAO) Precursors in Healthy Dogs: A Pilot Study.
PG  - 936092
LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.936092 [doi]
AB  - Elevations in circulating trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and its precursors areobserved in humans and dogs with heart failure and are associated with adverseoutcomes in people. Dietary intervention that reduces or excludes animalingredients results in rapid reduction of plasma TMAO and TMAO precursors inpeople, but the impact of diet in dogs has not been studied. The objective of thecurrent study was to determine the effect of diet on plasma TMAO and 2 of itsprecursors (choline and betaine) in dogs fed a commercial extruded plant-baseddiet (PBD) or a commercial extruded traditional diet (TD) containing animal andplant ingredients. Sixteen healthy adult mixed breed dogs from a universitycolony were enrolled in a randomized, 2-treatment, 2-period crossoverweight-maintenance study. Mean (SD) age and body weight of the dogs were 2.9years (+/- 1.7) and 14.5 kg (+/- 4.0), respectively. Eight dogs were female (3intact, 5 spayed) and 8 dogs were male (4 intact, 4 castrated). Plasma choline,betaine and TMAO were quantified by LC-SID-MRM/MS at baseline, and after 4 weeks on each diet. Choline and betaine were also quantified in the diets. Plasmacholine levels were significantly lower (P = 0.002) in dogs consuming a PBD (Mean+/- SD, 6.8 muM +/- 1.2 muM) compared to a TD (Mean +/- SD, 7.8 muM +/- 1.6 muM).Plasma betaine levels were also significantly lower (P = 0.03) in dogs consuming a PBD (Mean +/- SD, 109.1 muM +/- 25.3 muM) compared to a TD (Mean +/- SD, 132.4 muM +/- 32.5 muM). No difference (P = 0.71) in plasma TMAO was detected in dogsconsuming a PBD (Median, IQR, 2.4 muM, 2.1 muM) compared to a TD (Median, IQR,2.3 muM, 1.1 muM). Betaine content was lower in the PBD than in the TD whilecholine content was similar in the diets. Our findings indicate consumption of a commercial extruded PBD for 4 weeks reduces circulating levels of the TMAOprecursors choline and betaine, but not TMAO, in healthy adult dogs.

AB  - The role of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in the investigation of brainmetabolites in epileptic syndromes in dogs has not been explored systematicallyto date. The aim of this study was to investigate metabolites in the thalamus in dogs affected by idiopathic epilepsy (IE) with and without antiepileptic drugtreatment (AEDT) and to compare them to unaffected controls. Our hypothesis isthat similar to humans with generalized epilepsy and loss of consciousness,N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) would be reduced, and glutamate-glutamine (Glx) would beincreased in treated and untreated IE in comparison with the control group. Inthis prospective case-control study, Border Collie (BC) and Greater SwissMountain dog (GSMD) were divided into three groups: (1) healthy controls, IE withgeneralized tonic-clonic seizures with (2) and without (3) AEDT. A total of 41 BCand GSMD were included using 3 Tesla single-voxel proton MRS of the thalamus(PRESS localization, shortest TE, TR = 2000 ms, NSA = 240). After exclusion of 11dogs, 30 dogs (18 IE and 12 healthy controls) remained available for analysis.Metabolite concentrations were estimated with LCModel using creatine as referenceand compared using Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. The Kruskal-Wallistest revealed significant differences in the NAA-to-creatine (p = 0.04) andGlx-to-creatine (p = 0.03) ratios between the three groups. The Wilcoxon rank-sumtest further showed significant reduction in the NAA/creatine ratio in idiopathicepileptic dogs under AEDT compared to epileptic dogs without AEDT (p = 0.03) and compared to healthy controls (p = 0.03). In opposite to humans, Glx/creatineratio was significantly reduced in dogs with IE under AEDT compared to epileptic dogs without AEDT (p = 0.03) and controls (p = 0.02). IE without AEDT and healthycontrols did not show significant difference, neither in NAA/creatine (p = 0.60),nor in Glx-to-creatine (p = 0.55) ratio. In conclusion, MRS showed changes indogs with IE and generalized seizures under AEDT, but not in those without AEDT. Based upon these results, MRS can be considered a useful advanced imagingtechnique for the evaluation of dogs with IE in the clinical and researchsettings.

AB  - Introduction: Onchocerca lupi is a zoonotic parasite of carnivores reported incountries from Europe, North America, Asia and Africa. In Romania, canine ocular onchocercosis was first reported in dogs in 2016 from Targoviste (DambovitaCounty) and Onesti (Bacau County) and more recently, it was detected in an adult stray dog exported to UK from an unspecified location in Romania. Methods: A4-years old male mongrel dog was referred to a private veterinary clinic inNavodari (Constanta County), Romania due to ocular disorders. The dog wasoriginally from a public dog shelter in Bals (Olt County) and transferred in June2020 to a dog shelter in Medgidia (Constanta County). A cytological examinationfollowed by surgical removal of the granuloma localized at the internal angle of the right eye, and molecular identification of the extracted nematode were done. Results: The cytological examination confirmed a parasitic granuloma. Skin biopsyand PCR confirmed the infection with O. lupi. Two doses of moxidectin andimidacloprid were administered after the surgery. No relapse observed after aperiod of follo-up of 11 months. Conclusion: Onchocerca lupi is present in dogsfrom Romania with its actual distribution remaining unknown.

PG  - 915896
LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.915896 [doi]
AB  - It is commonly accepted that some form of skin barrier dysfunction is present in canine atopic dermatitis (AD), one of the most common cutaneous pruriticinflammatory diseases of dogs. The impaired skin barrier function facilitates thepenetration of allergens and subsequently stronger sensitization responses. Therole of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) in the physiology and pathology of theskin is becoming increasingly established. It has been demonstrated thatcannabinoid receptors are expressed in healthy and diseased skin and, based oncurrent knowledge, it could be stated that cannabinoids are important mediatorsin the skin. The present study has been designed to immunohistochemicallyinvestigate the expression of the cannabinoid receptors type 1 (CB1R) and 2(CB2R) and the cannabinoid-related receptors G protein-coupled receptor 55(GPR55), transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) and ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors alpha (PPARalpha), and serotoninergicreceptor 1a (5-HT1aR) in keratinocytes of healthy dogs and of dogs with AD.Samples of skin tissues were collected from 7 healthy controls (CTRL-dogs) andfrom 8 dogs with AD (AD-dogs). The tissue samples were processed using animmunofluorescence assay with commercially available antibodies, and theimmunolabelling of the receptors studied was quantitatively evaluated. Thekeratinocytes of the CTRL- and the AD-dogs showed immunoreactivity for all thereceptors investigated with a significant upregulation of CB2R, TRPA1, and5-HT1aR in the epidermis of the AD-dogs. The presence of cannabinoid andcannabinoid-related receptors in healthy keratinocytes suggested the possiblerole of the ECS in canine epidermal homeostasis while their overexpression in theinflamed tissues of the AD-dogs suggested the involvement of the ECS in thepathogenesis of this disease, having a possible role in the related skininflammation and itching. Based on the present findings, the ECS could beconsidered a potential therapeutic target for dogs with AD.

AB  - Analysis of the expression of inflammatory markers before starting treatment inhuman patients with cancer helps to predict outcomes and prognosis; however,there have been few studies on this topic in veterinary medicine. The presentstudy aimed to evaluate inflammatory indices before treatment with autologousantitumor vaccine alone or this vaccine plus metronomic chemotherapy (MC) topredict response and prognosis. The indices included the neutrophil-lymphocyteratio (NRL), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), monocyte-lymphocyte ratio (MLR),systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), C-reactive-protein-albumin ratio(CRP/ALB), lactate dehydrogenase level (LDH), frequency of blood lymphocytesubsets (CD4(+), CD8(+), Treg, and CD4/CD8 ratio) and frequency of bloodmyeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs: monocytic [M]- MDSCs, and granulocytic[PMN]-MDSCs). Blood samples were collected from 25 dogs with oral melanomatreated with the autologous antitumor vaccine and from nine dogs that received MCplus vaccine before surgery. There were no statistically significant differences in the progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) between thegroups. In addition to the clinical stage, the CRP/ALB ratio and bloodcirculating Tregs in the univariate analysis showed an association with PFS andOS, and thus were selected for multivariable analysis. The CRP/ALB ratio wasassociated with PFS [hazard ratio (HR), 1.1; 95% confidence interval (CI),1.0-1.1; p = 0.017] and OS [HR, 1; 95%CI, 1.0-1.1; p = 0.023]. Similarly, Tregwas associated with PFS (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.1; p = 0.001) and OS (HR, 1.6;95% CI, 1.2-2.1; p = 0.001). Furthermore, canine patients with a CRP/ALB ratioabove the cut-off point of 1.9 (established by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis) had worse PFS and OS, indicating the impact of the preoperativeCRP/ALB ratio on the PFS and OS of dogs with oral melanoma. The CRP/ALB ratio andfrequency of circulating Tregs are potential prognostic markers in dogs with oralmelanoma.

AB  - Objective: To describe risk factors associated with demographics, training, andcompetition for iliopsoas injury in dogs participating in agility competitions,as well as describe owner reported treatment and return to sport followinginjury. Procedures: An internet-based survey of agility handlers collected riskfactor data for dogs participating in agility. Owners were asked questions about demographics, training, and competition as well as injury treatment and recovery if applicable. Associations between variables of interest and iliopsoas injurywere estimated with logistic regression. The final risk factor model was builtvia modified backward selection, with all variables in the final model showingsignificant associations at p < 0.05. Results: Of the 4,197 dogs in the sample,327 (7.8%) reported iliopsoas injury. The final model identified six risk factorsfor iliopsoas injury. A higher risk of iliopsoas injury was observed for theBorder Collie breed, dogs with handlers who are veterinary assistants, dogscompeting on dirt, dogs competing on artificial turf 6+ times a year, and dogsthat trained with the 2 x 2 method for weave poles. Dogs that were not acquiredwith agility in mind were observed to have a decreased risk of injury. Factorslike number of competition days and jump height were not significantly associatedwith risk of iliopsoas injury. Owners sought veterinary care for 88% of dogs withiliopsoas injury, including specialty care for 63%. Treatment most often includedrest, home rehabilitation, formal rehabilitation, and/or oral medications. Mostdogs (80%) were able to return to sport within 6 months, while 20% were out forlonger than 6 months, or retired. Conclusion and Clinical Relevance: Iliopsoasinjury can necessitate a significant amount of time off from training andcompetition, and even lead to retirement of dogs competing in agility. Some ofthe risk factors identified in this study can inherently not be modified (breed, intended use, and handler profession), but can be taken into consideration forinjury prevention strategies. Competition and training risk factors that can bemodified, such as weave training, may help to inform guidelines for bestpractices in management of the agility athlete.

TI  - Time and sequence of emergence of the deciduous dentition in dogs and itsapplicability for age estimation.
LID - 10.1111/ahe.12838 [doi]
AB  - This study investigated the influence of several covariates on the time andsequence of deciduous dentition emergence in puppies. Data were obtained in alongitudinal study, with some cross-sectional observations, of 1001 puppies of 53dog breeds. A parametric proportional hazards survival model was used to estimatemedian emergence time and evaluate the effect of the covariates. No significantdifferences were found between the left and right sides of a puppy's dentition,but differences were statistically significant for the earlier appearance ofmaxillary incisors and canines and later appearance of maxillary premolarscompared with their mandibular counterparts. The tendency for delayed onset andcompletion of emergence in female compared to male puppies was statistically but not clinically significant. The differences between puppies of breeds ofdifferent size or skull type were both statistically and clinically significant, with small and brachycephalic breeds showing later emergence times, longerclinical eruption times and more individual variation. Per quadrant, regardlessof dog breed, canines or incisors were usually the first teeth to emerge andfully erupt, followed by premolars in the order Pd3 > 4 > 2. The maxillarycanines and incisors usually emerged earlier than mandibular canines. Ageestimation standards for breed size groups are presented based on the number ofemerged teeth per quadrant. To assess whether a puppy has reached the legallyrequired minimum age of 8 weeks to leave the litter, the best predictivecapability using the data from this study is obtained when assessing theemergence status of the deciduous third premolars.

AB  - Canine mast cell tumors (MCTs) are a promising translational model for human mastcell neoplasms with striking similarities such as the Darier's sign and mutationsin the KIT gene. Whereas mast cell neoplasms are rare in humans, MCTs are themost frequent malignant neoplasms of the skin in dogs. In human systemicmastocytosis, serum tryptase is an important diagnostic criterion. Surprisingly, serum tryptase levels were not yet investigated in dogs with MCTs. Therefore, theaim of this study was to investigate whether serum tryptase levels in dogs withcutaneous MCTs were elevated compared to those of a non-MCT control group. As asecondary aim, it was investigated whether surgical manipulation caused anincrease in serum tryptase in canine MCT patients. A total of 48 serum sampleswere collected from dogs with different grades of cutaneous MCTs (n = 24) andnon-MCT controls (n = 24). In dogs with cutaneous MCTs, blood was collected priorto and within 1 h after surgery. Serum tryptase levels were measured using acommercially available canine-specific ELISA kit. No significant difference inserum tryptase levels was found between cutaneous MCT patients and non-MCTcontrols, nor in these levels before versus after surgery. Our findings in caninecutaneous MCTs are in accordance with human cutaneous mastocytosis, where serumtryptase levels tend to remain within the normal range. However, despite various similarities between aggressive mast cell tumors in dogs and humans, serumtryptase cannot be considered a diagnostic biomarker in dogs with cutaneous MCTs as part of a comparative oncologic strategy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: There is little published regarding the association between canine cardiovascular disease and the hepatic system. The objective of the study was to evaluate the relationship between hepatic parameters, survival, and diseasestages of dogs with either dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) or degenerative valvular disease (DVD). ANIMALS, MATERIALS, AND METHODS: Retrospective study analyzinghepatic parameters in dogs with DVD or DCM in American College of VeterinaryInternal Medicine (ACVIM) stage B or C and healthy control dogs. Associationsbetween liver parameters, type and stage of disease, and survival wereinvestigated. RESULTS: Ninety-nine dogs were included in the study: 61 DVD, 22DCM, and 16 controls. Differences in liver parameter concentrations between DCM, DVD, and disease stages were found. Univariate analysis identified alanineaminotransferase (P < 0.001), aspartate aminotransferase (P = 0.02), and totalbilirubin (P = 0.005) as predictors of mortality. In the multivariate analysis,total bilirubin remained an independent predictor of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The observed differences between DCM, DVD, and disease stages are likely consistentwith disease-specific hemodynamics and progression of disease. This and the role of total bilirubin as an independent predictor for mortality indicate that indogs with DVD and DCM the cardiovascular-hepatic interaction might be ofrelevance for disease progression and outcome, as reported for humans withcardiac disease. Further studies into the role of hepatic function in caninecardiac disease are required.

AB  - According to the literature, as many as 60% of domestic dogs are overweight,whereby obesity is implicated in many serious diseases and hence a reduction ofbody weight results in a reduced risk of disease. Approximately 32% of reduction diets are unsuccessful in helping dogs to reach their ideal body weight. Thelikely reasons for this high drop-out rate include, among others, the fear ofincreased hunger-induced distress or a loss of affection on the part of the pettowards the owner. To alleviate these apprehensions, the use of optical effectsthat increase the perceived food intake could be useful. To investigate this, amixed-methods study design was applied and 100 test persons - including dogowners and non-owners - were instructed to fill up 11 separate dog bowls with thesame amount of dogfood. The bowls varied in five different variables (totalheight, upper diameter, angulation of sidewall, volume, and colour). Theinfluence of the shape and colour of the dog bowls in relation to the fillingquantity was evaluated. Overall, the body of the inner food bowl - especially itsdiameter and shape - showed a significant impact on the feeder as the wider thediameter, the more the dog bowl was filled. Moreover, the flatter the sidewallwas angulated, the larger the fill-up quantity. Significantly, the volume on its own did not have a significant impact on the feeder. A difference of up to 37.6% in fill quantity resulted depending on the type of dog bowl used. Furthermore,the use of inner cones confused the test persons whereas different colours andthe total height of the bowl showed no impact. Dog bowls with a small upperdiameter and a steep sidewall - regardless of volume and colour - were filledless by the test persons. This tendency could be useful for adapting the feeding of overweight dogs or those with an increased risk of obesity.

AB  - The experiences that domestic dogs have with humans take many forms. Wehypothesized that more experience with humans would lead to greater dependence onhumans in problem-solving situations. We used the unsolvable task to comparepersistence and gazing in dogs with differing degrees of experience with humans: 1) dogs living in a home for a year or more; 2) dogs living in a home for lessthan a year (including foster dogs); and 3) shelter dogs. Dogs first learned asolvable task; we then measured persistence as well as gazing at humans when the task was unsolvable. Dogs living in a home for a year or more gazed sooner andlonger than shelter dogs. Formally trained dogs from breeders also gazed soonerthan formally trained dogs from shelters. There were no differences in overallpersistence among the three types of dog. However, shelter dogs spent more timebiting the box and gazing at it than dogs in the home. Former shelter dogs,former strays, and dogs that had no formal training also spent more time bitingthe box.

AB  - Continuous Passive Motion (CPM) devices have been used to assist physiciansconducting human rehabilitation; however, similar machines specific for caninerehabilitation have not been found in the reviewed literature. This researchperformed a physical analysis of the hind limb of dogs to design a device forimplementing automated CPM exercises. The device proved to comply with theguidelines to perform CPM exercises, allowing a proper setting of parameters togenerate rehabilitation routines customized for different rehabilitationrequirements. Also, an electromyography acquisition module was incorporated into the system, with surface electrodes to visualize and provide feedback to the userfor muscle activation. Limitations were encountered with a range of motion of 80 degrees and an error of approximately 2% for angular position accuracy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To (1) describe exposure history, clinical signs, treatment, anddiagnostic findings in 4 dogs following ingestion of tamarinds, and in 2 dogsfollowing ingestion of cream of tartar, and (2) discuss tartaric acid, the commondenominator, as the proposed toxic principle in tamarinds and grapes. SERIESSUMMARY: Reports in which dogs developed acute kidney injury following ingestion of cream of tartar or tamarinds were identified from the ASPCA Animal PoisonControl Center electronic database. In these cases, decontamination was notperformed, and treatments were delayed. Despite IV fluids and symptomatic andsupportive care, 2 of the dogs became anuric and 1 became oliguric. Four dogswere euthanized, and the outcome is unknown for 2 of the dogs. Necropsies wereperformed on 3 of the dogs. Clinical signs, laboratory findings, andhistopathologic lesions were similar to those reported in grape and raisintoxicosis. NEW OR UNIQUE INFORMATION PROVIDED: Acute kidney injury may developfollowing ingestion of cream of tartar or tamarinds in dogs. Connecting thesereports with findings in grape and raisin toxicosis and the sensitivity totartaric acid in dogs, tartaric acid is identified as the likely toxic component in grapes and tamarinds.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Oral medication of small animals, particularly cats, is oftenchallenging. The transdermal route may provide an easier option for owners toadminister chronic treatment. Tramadol is an analgesic mainly used in humans; it is also commonly used in dogs, despite some controversy over its clinicalefficacy. Recent studies have suggested that tramadol is efficacious for painmanagement in cats. In cats, the inner pinna is the most commonly used site fortransdermal drug therapy; the use of this site has been validated in experimentalstudies of methimazole and mirtazapine treatment. This ex vivo study aimed tocharacterise the percutaneous absorption pharmacokinetics of a formulation oftramadol in Pentravan through feline inner pinna skin. METHODS: High-performance liquid chromatography was used to assess the stability of the tramadolformulation (100 mg/ml in Pentravan) over three months at room temperature.Forced degradation was also assessed in neutral, acidic, alkaline, and oxidative conditions. A Franz cell system was employed to evaluate percutaneous absorption of a finite dose of tramadol. RESULTS: The tramadol formulation was stable forthree months at room temperature. Tramadol penetrated through ex vivo felineinner pinna skin, but considerable intra- and inter-individual variability inkinetics was observed. Comparison with another vehicle, Lipoderm, revealed nosignificant difference in the percutaneous absorption of tramadol. CONCLUSIONSAND RELEVANCE: The Pentravan formulation assessed in this study supportedtramadol absorption across the feline inner ear skin. In vivo studies arenecessary to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of this formulation.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0264986 [doi]
AB  - Cancer genomic heterogeneity presents significant challenges for understandingoncogenic processes and for cancer's clinical management. Variation in drivermutation frequency between patients with the same tumor type as well as within anindividual patients' cancer can shape the use of mutations as diagnostic,prognostic, and predictive biomarkers. We have characterized genomicheterogeneity between and within canine splenic hemangiosarcoma (HSA), a commonnaturally occurring cancer in pet dogs that is similar to human angiosarcoma(AS). HSA is a clinically, physiologically, and genomically complex canine cancerthat may serve as a valuable model for understanding the origin and clinicalimpact of cancer heterogeneity. We conducted a prospective collection of 52splenic masses from 43 dogs (27 HSA, 15 benign masses, and 1 stromal sarcoma)presenting for emergency care with hemoperitoneum secondary to a ruptured splenicmass. Multi-platform genomic analysis included matched tumor/normal targetedsequencing panel and exome sequencing. We found candidate somatic cancer drivermutations in 14/27 (52%) HSAs. Among recurrent candidate driver mutations, TP53was most commonly mutated (30%) followed by PIK3CA (15%), AKT1 (11%), andCDKN2AIP (11%). We also identified significant intratumoral genomicheterogeneity, consistent with a branched evolution model, through multi-regionexome sequencing of three distinct tumor regions from selected primary splenictumors. These data provide new perspectives on the genomic landscape of thisveterinary cancer and suggest a cross-species value for using HSA in pet dogs as a naturally occurring model of intratumoral heterogeneity.

AB  - Research on the evolution of dog foraging and diet has largely focused onscavenging during their initial domestication and genetic adaptations tostarch-rich food environments following the advent of agriculture. The Siberianarchaeological record evidences other critical shifts in dog foraging and dietthat likely characterize Holocene dogs globally. By the Middle Holocene, bodysize reconstruction for Siberia dogs indicates that most were far smaller thanPleistocene wolves. This contributed to dogs' tendencies to scavenge, feed onsmall prey, and reduce social foraging. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotopeanalysis of Siberian dogs reveals that their diets were more diverse than thoseof Pleistocene wolves. This included habitual consumption of marine andfreshwater foods by the Middle Holocene and reliance on C4 foods by the LateHolocene. Feeding on such foods and anthropogenic waste increased dogs' exposure to microbes, affected their gut microbiomes, and shaped long-term dog population history.

AB  - Dogs with food allergies and enteropathies may require hydrolyzed diets toprevent or reduce clinical signs, therefore the protein sources used in thesediets must be previously characterized and evaluated in healthy dogs. This study aimed to investigate the effects of a hydrolyzed chicken liver powder-based diet (HCLP) versus a poultry by-product meal and bovine meat and bone meal-based diet (Control), on complete blood count (CBC), cytokine, immunoglobulins responses(assessed on days 0, 15, 30 and 45), and fecal microbiota (assessed on day 45) inhealthy adult dogs. The CBC did not differ between diets (P>0.05), remainingwithin reference range. Total plasma IL-4 concentrations were decreased over timeindependent of the dietary treatment (P<0.001). Total plasma IgA decreased on day30 compared to days 0 and 45 in dogs fed the control diet (P<0.001). Total plasmaIgE concentrations were reduced on days 30 and 45 in dogs fed the control diet,and on days 15 vs 30 and 15 vs 45 in dogs fed HCLP diet (P = 0.001). The 16S rRNAgene sequencing showed similar species richness and abundances of phyla andgenera between diets (P>0.05). beta-diversity principal coordinate analysis plotsdemonstrated that HCLP group had a higher similarity than control. Based on ourresults, healthy adult dogs fed a HCLP based diet maintained normal values forhematological and immunological characteristics, and fecal microbiota after 45days of feeding.

TI  - Gastrointestinal helminths in dogs: occurrence, risk factors, and multipleantiparasitic drug resistance.
LID - 10.1007/s00436-022-07599-0 [doi]
AB  - Helminth infections are detrimental to the overall health of dogs; therefore,this study aimed to identify antiparasitic-resistant helminths and evaluate theinfection rate and risk factors for parasitism in canines. For this purpose, aparasitological evaluation of 38 randomly selected animals was performed,followed by the evaluation of the anthelminthic efficacy of three drugs: pyrantelpamoate with praziquantel (Canex Composto(R)), fenbendazole (Fenzol Pet(R)), and milbemycin oxime with praziquantel (Milbemax C(R)). Among the evaluated animals, 22/38 (57.89%) tested negative and 16/38 (42.71%) tested positive for Ancylostomacaninum infection. Evaluation of the efficacy of antiparasitic drugs showed that 12/16 (75%) dogs were infected with helminths that were susceptible to pyrantelpamoate with praziquantel. Among those for which pyrantel pamoate withpraziquantel was not effective, 3/4 (75%) were susceptible to fenbendazole, whilethe remaining case resistant to both pyrantel pamoate with praziquantel andfenbendazole was sensitive to milbemycin oxime with praziquantel (100%). The oddsratio of infection in dogs inhabiting environments containing soil or grass was6.67 times higher than that in dogs inhabiting impermeable environments.Mixed-breed dogs (SRD) were 6.54 times more likely to be infected compared topurebred dogs. A. caninum resistant to pyrantel pamoate with praziquantel (4/16, 25%) and fenbendazole (1/4, 25%) were detected. The results of this studydemonstrated the importance of coproparasitological monitoring by professionalsbefore and after treatments to assess antiparasitic drug effectiveness, ensureanimal health and welfare, and minimize animal exposure to risk factors.

TI  - Primary repair of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-associated full thicknessgastrointestinal ulcers in 11 dogs.
LID - 10.1111/vsu.13853 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report the outcomes of dogs that underwent primary repair ofgastroduodenal perforations associated with the administration of nonsteroidalanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). A secondary objective was to identifyclinicopathological findings that predisposed dogs to postoperative death. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. ANIMALS: Eleven dogs with complete gastric orduodenal perforation related to administration of an NSAID that underwent primarysurgical repair. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed for dogs that presentedwith peritonitis due to a complete gastroduodenal perforation while receivingNSAIDs between November, 2011 and January, 2021. Data collected included patient characteristics, clinical signs, clinicopathological results, surgical details,and postoperative management and outcome. RESULTS: All dogs were large breeds(mean weight 42 kg; range 22-75 kg), with a mean age of 7.35 years. Nine dogsfrom a total of 11 (82 %) received a concurrent corticosteroid and NSAID, or ahigher dose/frequency/length of NSAID administration than recommended by themanufacturer. All gastroduodenal perforations were found in the uppergastrointestinal tract. Eight of 11 (73%) dogs survived to discharge. The median postoperative duration of follow up was 444 days (range 2-1460 days). Noassociation was detected between ulcer size or location and mortality.CONCLUSION: Most dogs who underwent primary repair of complete gastroduodenalulcers survived. Gastroduodenal perforations were generally due to theadministration of higher or longer doses of NSAIDs, or concurrent administration of another NSAID or corticosteroid. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Primary closure may beassociated with a high success rate in dogs with full thickness gastroduodenalulcers.

TI  - Local treatment for canine anal sacculitis: A retrospective study of 33 dogs.
LID - 10.1111/vde.13102 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little information has been published regarding treatment of canineanal sacculitis (AS). OBJECTIVES: Primary objective: determine the outcomes of ASlocal treatment at the referral dermatology service of the authors' institution. SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: determine signalment, body condition score (BCS), stoolquality and comorbidities associated with AS. ANIMALS: Thirty-three dogs with AS presented to the referral dermatology service between 1 January 2010 and 31 March2021. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An electronic medical record search was conducted.Information regarding sex, breed, age at disease onset, weight, BCS, stoolquality, comorbidities, treatment and treatment outcome were collected. Treatmentoutcome was categorised as "resolved clinically", "clinical signs resolved perowner", "did not complete treatment" or "failed". Dogs were excluded if seen byanother service, not treated for AS, or if perianal sinuses (fistulae), anal sac masses, or anal sac abscesses were identified. RESULTS: Nineteen dogs were maleand 14 female. Twenty-four breeds were included. Average age at disease onset was4.4 years. Average BCS was 5.8 of 9. Stool quality was "poor" in seven of 33 and normal in 23 of 33 cases. Atopic dermatitis was the most common comorbidity (12of 33). Treatment typically consisted of anal sac flushing with saline followedby infusion using a commercially available steroid/antibiotic/antifungalointment. Treatment was repeated on average 2.9 times. Resolution of AS wasobtained in 24 of 33 cases, clinical signs resolved per owner in four of 33, fiveof 33 cases did not complete treatment, and no cases failed treatment.CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Local treatment with flushing and infusion iseffective for treating AS in dogs.

TI  - Evaluation of proton pump inhibitor administration in hospitalized dogs in atertiary referral hospital.
LID - 10.1111/jvim.16491 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly administered tohospitalized dogs, prescribing patterns and appropriateness of use requirecontinued investigation. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVE: Describe prescription patterns andappropriateness of use associated with PPIs in hospitalized dogs at a singletertiary care facility. We hypothesized that the majority of prescriptions would not comply with current guidelines for the rational use of acid suppressants.ANIMALS: Two hundred randomly selected hospitalized dogs. METHODS: Retrospective evaluation of the medical records associated with a randomly selected sample ofhospitalized dogs that received PPIs between January 2013 and December 2018.RESULTS: A total of 12 610 dogs were admitted for first-time hospitalizationbetween January 2013 and December 2018. Forty percent of these dogs (5062/12610) were prescribed a PPI PO or IV. Of the 200 randomly selected records, an adequateindication for use was identified in 27% of dogs (54/200). Of the dogs surviving to discharge, 54% (95/175) were discharged with a PPI and 51.6% (49/95) of those were prescribed an inadequate dose. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPORTANCE: Our findingssupport other studies in which the majority of PPI prescriptions for hospitalizeddogs at a tertiary care hospital lacked an appropriate indication. Furthermore,analysis of the prescribing patterns of dispensed PPIs identified a frequentoccurrence of dosages considered inadequate, raising concern for ineffectivetreatment even with appropriate indications of use. With growing concern ofadverse effects associated with PPI and other acid suppressant administration in human and veterinary medicine, rational use of these medications followingconsensus guidelines should be emphasized and treatment should be reserved fordogs with historical, physical examination, clinicopathologic, and imagingfindings supportive of an appropriate indication for use.

TI  - Comparison of Two Different Canine Anti-IgG Antibodies for Assessment ofOligoclonal Bands in Cerebrospinal Fluid and Serum of Dogs via IsoelectricFocusing Followed by an Immunoblot.

LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.873456 [doi]
AB  - Isoelectric focusing followed by immunoblotting is a method routinely used inhuman medicine to assess the presence of oligoclonal bands (OCBs) incerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum. The detection of OCBs is a valuablediagnostic test, especially important in patients with the suspicion of multiple sclerosis (MS), in which at least two OCBs are found in the CSF not present inpaired serum samples in up to 95% of patients. So far, presence of OCBs in CSFand serum of dogs has only been investigated in a small cohort of dogs diagnosed with degenerative myelopathy and healthy dogs. The main objective of the current study was to describe the method used for OCB detection and compare two differentcanine anti-IgG antibodies: a canine rabbit-anti-IgG antibody (JacksonImmunoResearch) vs. a canine goat-anti-IgG antibody (Bio-Rad). The method wasperformed according to the instructions of the commercial kit used. The caninegoat-anti-IgG antibody showed a better performance than the caninerabbit-anti-IgG antibody. The availability of the technique of OCB detection inthe dog paves the way for further studies, especially in the field ofinflammatory diseases of the canine central nervous system, and comparisonbetween specific human and canine diseases.

TI  - Field trial investigating the efficacy of a long-acting imidacloprid10%/flumethrin 4.5% polymer matrix collar (Seresto(R), Elanco) compared tomonthly topical fipronil for the chemoprevention of canine tick-borne pathogensin Cambodia.

AB  - The tropical brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus linnaei, commonly infests canines inthe tropics and is an important vector for disease-causing and sometimes lethalpathogens including Babesia spp., Ehrlichia canis, Hepatozoon canis and Anaplasmaplatys. In tropical climates ticks and their pathogens exert an extremely highinfection pressure on unprotected dogs. To protect canines in such regions,effective acaricidal products possessing a speed of kill that blocks pathogentransmission is paramount. We conducted a 12-month community trial to compare thechemoprophylactic efficacy of two topical commercial acaricidal formulations: an imidacloprid 10% and flumethrin 4.5%, 8-month acting collar (Seresto(R)) against a monthly spot-on containing 12% w/v fipronil (Detick, Thailand). In a separateanalysis, we used baseline data collected at the start of the trial to quantifytick-borne pathogen (TBP) infection status in dogs with a prior history of being administered a systemically-acting (isoxazoline) versus a topically-actingectoparasiticide. We found that both topical products in the community trialdemonstrated high efficacy at protecting dogs from ticks and TBP, with Seresto(R)demonstrating a moderate increase in protection at 3 (95% confidence interval(CI): 1-5) TBP-positive dogs per 100 dog-years at risk compared to 11 (95% CI:4-26) TBP-positive dogs per 100 dog-years at risk for those on fipronil.Additionally, at baseline dogs treated with commercial systemic isoxazolineacaricides prior to the trial's commencement were 2.7 (95% CI: 0.5-15.0) timesmore likely to be TBP-positive compared to dogs that had been topically treated, highlighting such isoxazoline products as being less efficacious than topicalproducts at preventing canine TBP acquisition in a tropical setting.

AB  - Following a request from the European Commission, EFSA was asked to deliver ascientific opinion on the efficacy of Limosilactobacillus reuteri (formerlyLactobacillus reuteri) DSM 32203 as a zootechnical additive for dogs. Theadditive is a preparation of viable cells of L. reuteri DSM 32203 and it has not been previously authorised as a feed additive in the European Union. The additiveis intended for use in complete feed for dogs at a minimum use level of 6 x 10(9)colony forming units (CFU) per animal and day. In a previous opinion, the FEEDAP Panel could not conclude on the efficacy of L. reuteri DSM 32203 for dogs. Theapplicant has provided supplementary information to support the efficacy of theadditive to dogs. Based on the data provided, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that L. reuteri DSM 32203 has the potential to improve faecal consistency by reducing themoisture content of stools from dogs receiving the additive at 1 x 10(10) CFU/kg feed. However, the Panel has some reservations on the effects in the moisturecontent of stools, which if maintained over time might cast doubts on thebenefits on the long-term use of the additive since it could lead toconstipation.

TI  - A PNPLA8 frameshift variant in Australian shepherd dogs with hereditary ataxia.
LID - 10.1111/age.13245 [doi]
AB  - Hereditary ataxias are common among canine breeds with various molecularetiology. We identified a hereditary ataxia in young-adult Australian Shepherddogs characterized by uncoordinated movements and spasticity, worseningprogressively and leading to inability to walk. Pedigree analysis suggested anautosomal recessive transmission. By whole genome sequencing and variantfiltering of an affected dog we identified a PNPLA8:c.1169_1170dupTT variant.This variant, located in PNPLA8 (Patatin Like Phospholipase Domain Containing 8),was predicted to induce a PNPLA8:p.(His391PhefsTer394) frameshift, leading to apremature stop codon in the protein. The truncated protein was predicted to lack the functional patatin catalytic domain of PNPLA8, a calcium-independentphospholipase. PNPLA8 is known to be essential for maintaining mitochondrialenergy production through tailoring mitochondrial membrane lipid metabolism andcomposition. The Australian Shepherd ataxia shares molecular and clinicalfeatures with Weaver syndrome in cattle and the mitochondrial-relatedneurodegeneration associated with PNPLA8 loss-of-function variants in humans. By genotyping a cohort of 85 control Australian Shepherd dogs sampled in France, we found a 4.7% carrier frequency. The PNPLA8:c.[1169_1170dupTT] allele is easilydetectable with a genetic test to avoid at-risk matings.

TI  - Leptospirosis vaccination in dogs attending UK primary care practices: vaccineuptake and factors associated with administration.
PG  - 285

AB  - BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease that is found globally andaffects most mammalian species. Vaccination of dogs against leptospirosis is animportant approach to preventing clinical disease, or reducing disease severity, as well as reducing transmission of the infection to humans. Although it isgenerally considered to be a 'core' vaccine, there is limited information on the level of leptospirosis vaccine usage and factors associated with its usage indogs in the UK. The study aimed to report the uptake of leptospirosis vaccinationand factors associated with its usage in a cohort of dogs under primaryveterinary care during a 12-month period. RESULTS: From a population of 905,543dogs, 49% (95%CI 48.9-49.1%) had at least one leptospirosis vaccine administered during the 12 months of study. Adult dogs had reduced odds of receiving aleptospirosis vaccine when compared to dogs < 1 year old, with dogs > 8 years oldhaving a greater than ten-fold reduction in odds (OR = 0.08, 95%CI 0.07-0.09).Odds of receiving a leptospirosis vaccine was increased in insured dogs whencompared to uninsured dogs (OR = 1.22, 95%CI = 1.17-1.28). Neutered dogs hadreduced odds of receiving a leptospirosis vaccine (OR = 0.87, 95%CI 0.83-0.91).Breed associations with receiving a leptospirosis vaccine varied. Several breeds were associated with increased odds of receiving a leptospirosis vaccine whencompared to crossbreed dogs, including Border Terriers (OR = 1.49, 95%CI1.42-1.57), Golden Retrievers (OR = 1.30, 95%CI = 1.24-1.37), Cocker Spaniels (OR= 1.27, 95%CI 1.23-1.31) and West Highland White Terriers (OR = 1.27, 95%CI1.22-1.31). French Bulldogs (OR = 0.64, 95%CI = 0.62-0.67), Staffordshire BullTerriers (OR = 0.79, 95%CI 0.78-0.82) and Pugs (OR = 0.91, 95%CI =0.88-0.95) had significantly reduced odds of receiving a leptospirosis vaccination during thestudy. CONCLUSION: This work identified that almost half of the UK primary careattending population received a leptospirosis vaccine during the year. Severaldemographic variables were associated with leptospirosis vaccine administration, with age being particularly important. Both the proportion of uptake and factors associated with leptospirosis vaccine usage can be used as a benchmark forcomparisons in the future. Additionally, an understanding of which populationshave reduced odds of receiving a leptospirosis vaccine can potentially be usedfor initiatives to encourage owner vaccination uptake in these groups.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine how frequently the current criteria for left ventricular enlargement in dogs misclassify healthy dogs as having left ventricularenlargement; to examine the effect of breed on diastolic left ventricularnormalized dimensions (LVIDDN); to propose appropriate scaling exponents andreference limits for dogs. ANIMALS: Echocardiographic data from 1,124 healthyadult dogs, including 454 dogs weighing <20 kg. METHODS: We calculated powerregression parameters (allometric scaling), including exponents andproportionality constants, for various subsets of the dogs (all dogs, dogs < 20kg, generic dogs, and individual breeds with >10 observations) and derived upper reference limits for LVIDDN. We determined the proportions of dogs that would be identified as having left ventricular enlargement with each regression modelcompared to previously published reference limits or guidelines. We thenidentified breeds failing to conform to generic dog models. RESULTS: The AmericanCollege of Veterinary Internal Medicine-recommended scaling exponent (0.294) and criterion for identifying left ventricular enlargement (1.7) identified >10% ofapparently healthy dogs as having left ventricular enlargement, with specificbreeds being misclassified up to 50% of the time. However, with a scalingexponent of 0.33, a constant of 1.7 represented a normal left ventricular size in97.5% of healthy dogs in both generic and non-conforming breeds. CONCLUSIONS:LVIDDN is breed-dependent. A constant of 1.7 with a scaling exponent of 0.294does not always represent ventricular enlargement; a scaling exponent of 0.33,with breed-specific reference limits for breeds that fail to conform toallometric models of generic dogs, reduces the misclassification of healthy dogs as having left ventricular enlargement.

AB  - Four adult dogs weighing <10 kg presented for the evaluation of severe mitralvalve stenosis with clinical signs. Owing to the size of the dogs, a hybridsurgical and interventional approach was utilized for balloon valvuloplasty. Aleft lateral thoracotomy was performed to allow direct entry through the leftatrial wall. Transesophageal echocardiography was utilized for the entirety ofthe procedure in all dogs, and fluoroscopy was additionally used in two dogs. Onedog had mild to moderate intra-operative bleeding from the left atrial wallduring the procedure, but no other intra-operative complications were observed.No dogs developed a clinically relevant amount of worsened mitral regurgitation. Based on mitral leaflet mobility and transmitral flow profiles, there wasperceived improvement in all four dogs. One dog died 6 h after extubation due to respiratory arrest. The remaining dogs survived to discharge and had resolutionof clinical signs at home and discontinuation of heart failure medications. Onedog died of an unknown cause at five months and another developed atrialfibrillation, and the owners elected to euthanize at ten months after theprocedure. One dog continues to do well six months after the procedure as of the time of this writing. Hybrid balloon valvuloplasty can be a viable managementoption for small breed dogs with severe mitral stenosis exhibiting clinicalsigns, and both transesophageal echocardiography and fluoroscopy can be usedintra-operatively to assist in successful procedural outcomes.

TI  - Novel Organization of the Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome mec Composite Islandin Clinical Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus hominis Subspecieshominis Isolates from Dogs.
PG  - e0099722
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.00997-22 [doi]
AB  - Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus hominis subsp. hominis are common coagulase-negative staphylococcus opportunistic pathogens. In Thailand, theclinical strains S. haemolyticus 1864 and 48 and S. hominis subsp. hominis 384and 371 have been recovered from sick dogs. These strains were methicillinresistant with the nontypeable staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec(NT-SCCmec). The SCCmec element distribution in the clinical isolates from dogswas analyzed using whole-genome sequencing, which revealed the presence ofdifferent SCCmec composite islands (CIs) and gene structure. The SCCmec-CIs ofpsiSCCmec1864 (13 kb) and psiSCC1864 (11 kb) with a class C1 mec complex but noccr gene were discovered in S. haemolyticus 1864. The CIs of psiSCCmec48 with aC1 mec complex (28 kb), SCC48 with ccrA4B4 (23 kb), and psiSCC48 (2.6 kb) werediscovered in S. haemolyticus 48. In SCC48, insertion sequence IS256 contained anaminoglycoside-resistant gene [aph(2'')-Ia]. Two copies of IS431 containing thetetracycline-resistant gene tet(K) were found downstream of psiSCC48. In S.hominis subsp. hominis, the SCCmec-CI in strain 384 had two separate sections:psiSCCmec384 (20 kb) and SCCars (23 kb). psiSCCmec384 lacked the ccr gene complexbut carried the class A mec complex. Trimethoprim-resistant dihydrofolatereductase (dfrC) was discovered on psiSCCmec384 between two copies of IS257. Instrain 371, SCCmec VIII (4A) (37 kb) lacking a direct repeat at the chromosomalend was identified. This study found SCCmec elements in clinical isolates fromdogs that were structurally complex and varied in their genetic content, withnovel organization. IMPORTANCE In Thailand, the staphylococcal cassettechromosome mec (SCCmec) element, which causes methicillin resistance throughacquisition of the mec gene, has been studied in clinical coagulase-negativeStaphylococcus isolates from various companion animals, and Staphylococcushaemolyticus and Staphylococcus hominis subsp. hominis were found to have themost nontypeable (NT)-SCCmec elements. These species are more prone to causingillness and more resistant to a variety of antimicrobials than othercoagulase-negative staphylococci. However, full characterization of NT-SCCmec in clinical S. haemolyticus and S. hominis subsp. hominis isolates from such animalshas been limited. Our findings support the use of full nucleotide sequencingrather than PCR designed for Staphylococcus aureus in further research of novelSCCmec elements. Moreover, several antimicrobial resistance and heavy metalresistance genes were identified on the SCCmec elements; these are important asthey could limit the therapeutic options available in veterinary medicine.

TI  - Integrated basic lung and heart ultrasound with X-ray (TUSX) for the diagnosis ofasthma, chronic bronchitis and laryngeal paralysis, and treatment with inhaledfluticasone using home-made mask in dogs and cats.
PG  - 335-344
LID - 10.24425/pjvs.2022.141819 [doi]
AB  - Basic lung and heart ultrasound examination combined with chest X-ray (TUSX) iscurrently considered to be very useful for differentiation of asthma, chronicbronchitis and laryngeal paralysis from other diseases with dyspnea/coughing.Among 252 client-owned animals with persistent dyspnea/cough/noisy breathing, in 197 of them: pulmonary edema, pneumonia, lung cancer, free pleural fluid,pneumothorax, lung contusion or heart disease were diagnosed. The remaining 55animals (42 dogs and 13 cats) were diagnosed with asthma (in 13 cats), chronicbronchitis (in 37 dogs) and laryngeal paralysis (in 5 dogs) using TUSX. Theseanimals were qualified for inhaled fluticasone treatment using 3 types of spacers- two commercial and a home- -made mask. 36 animals (65.5%) completed the trail. In 26 of them (72.2%) the owners observed complete, long lasting relief of thesymptoms, and the owners of 7 animals (19.5%) declared a considerable clinicalimprovement, regardless of the type of spacer used. The owners of 3 animals(8.3%) did not see any improvement. The proposed diagnostic and therapeuticmanagement improved long-term clinical status of the vast majority (91.7%) ofanimals. Therefore, it seems justified to include the TUSX diagnostic protocol indaily veterinary practice and to encourage owners to prepare home-made face masksfor inhaled fluticasone treatment.

AB  - In this study plasma concentrations of IL-1alpha and IL-8 in 29 female dogs with malignant mammary gland tumours (19 without metastasis and 10 with metastasis)and in 10 healthy control animals were determined. Concentrations of IL-1alphaand IL-8 were analysed using a specific canine ELISA assay. Mean plasmaconcentrations of IL-1alpha and IL-8 were significantly higher (p0.05) in female dogs with both non-metastatic and metastatic malignant tumours compared to thehealthy animals. The concentrations of both tested cytokines were significantlyincreased (p0.05) in the dogs with metastasis. In female dogs with mammarycarcinomas, the plasma concentration of IL-1alpha was significantly higher(p0.05) in the animals with grade 3 tumours compared to the dogs with grade 1tumours. The concentration of IL-8 was significantly higher (p0.05) in the dogswith grade 3 tumours compared to that found in the animals with grade 1 and grade2 tumours. A moderate correlation (r=0.433) was found between IL-1alpha and IL-8 concentrations in the female dogs. These findings suggest that increasedmalignancy and invasiveness of canine mammary tumours is associated with anincreased production of IL-1alpha and IL-8 in the tumour microenvironment, which,in turn, leads to an increase in their circulating levels. This may indicate thatcirculating levels of the cytokines investigated could be considered asdiagnostic and prognostic markers in canine malignant mammary tumours. However,further studies in this fields are needed.

AB  - The aim was to analyze the quality of commercial shampoo without prophylacticeffect for dogs. The analysis was based on the evaluations and requirementsestablished for human-line products since there is no guide for veterinaryproducts in Mexico; such evaluations have not been carried out or published inMexico. Physicochemical, sensory, performance, and consumer information tests of the shampoo were carried out. The sample consisted of twenty products marketed inMexico City. During the evaluation of the label, a serious non-compliance withapplicable regulations was found. The pH of the products ranged between 5.6 and8.4; Significant differences (p0.05) were found between the three groups with low(6.1), medium (7.2), and high (8.1) pH. Viscosity values were from 1131 to 3102. For the foam index, no statistically significant differences were found. 100% of the products analyzed complied with the rest of the quality tests carried out.The results of the quality analysis in this study will allow veterinariansspecializing in small species to better select and recommend the products fortheir use and inform dog owners, about the safety, and value of the products.

PG  - 223-229
LID - 10.24425/pjvs.2022.141806 [doi]
AB  - Gallbladder mucocele (GM) is a common extrahepatic biliary disease recognized in dogs and is defined as the expansion and extension of the gallbladder by anaccumulation of semi-solid bile or bile acid. Histopathological diagnosis ofnecrotizing cholecystitis and transmural coagulative necrosis of the gallbladder wall shows poor prognosis. Conversely, histopathological diagnosis with partialnecrotic findings is often achieved. We hypothesized that histopathologicalpartial necrosis of the gallbladder wall is the primary lesion of necroticcholecystitis or transmural ischemic necrosis. Therefore, we investigated therelationship between histopathological necrosis/ partial necrosis findings andtheir clinical conditions. We retrospectively analyzed 55 dogs diagnosed with GM that had undergone cholecystectomy at the Yamaguchi University Animal MedicalCenter. The group with histopathological necrosis/partial necrosis of thegallbladder wall showed elevated levels of preoperative white blood cells,alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, totalbilirubin, and C-reactive protein compared to the non-necrotic group. Partialnecrosis of the gallbladder wall may affect the progression of the disease andhematological abnormalities. Additionally, all death cases until 2 weeks wereincluded in the histopathological necrosis/partial necrosis group. In this study,we found that poor prognosis factors were associated with partial necrosis of thegallbladder wall. Furthermore, these cases of partial necrosis showed elevatedlevels of blood test parameters. These results suggest that necrosis of thegallbladder wall is associated with poor prognosis and poor pathophysiologicalconditions.

TI  - Conservation of miR combo based direct cardiac reprogramming.
PG  - 101310
LID - 10.1016/j.bbrep.2022.101310 [doi]
AB  - There is considerable interest in regenerating the injured heart by reprogrammingresident fibroblasts into new functional cardiomyocytes. Cardiac reprogramminghas been achieved via transcription factors or miRNAs. Transcription factorcombinations appear to be species-specific as evidenced by the fact thatcombinations of transcription factors which are effective for the reprogrammingof mouse fibroblasts are ineffective in pigs and humans. Whether miRNA basedcardiac reprogramming suffers from the same limitation is unknown. We havepreviously demonstrated that mouse cardiac fibroblasts can be directly converted into cardiomyocytes both in vitro and in vivo via a combination of four microRNAs(miR-1, miR-133a, miR-208a and miR-499) termed "miR combo." To assessspecies-specificity, miR combo was transfected into cardiac fibroblasts isolated from the left ventricle of dogs, pigs and humans. QPCR analysis indicated thatmiR combo effectively reprogrammed fibroblasts from all of the tested mammalianspecies. Significant upregulation of cardiac developmental, sarcomere, andcardiac ion channel genes was observed. Through Actn2+ staining, we also foundthat miR combo transfection induced dog, pig and human cardiac fibroblasts todevelop into cardiomyocyte-like cells. In conclusion, we have demonstrated thatin contrast to transcription factor based approaches, miR combo effectivelyreprograms mammalian cardiac fibroblasts into cardiomyocyte-like cells.

TI  - Comparison of Surgical Outcomes Associated With Compression Secondary toHemorrhage and Intervertebral Disk Extrusions in Dogs.
PG  - 889113
LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.889113 [doi]
AB  - Acute intervertebral disk extrusion (IVDE) is one of the most commonly reportedneurologic disorders seen in veterinary practice. There is a recognized subset ofIVDE cases that have a hemorrhagic inflammatory reaction within the epiduralspace that causes compression in addition to compression from herniated diskmaterial. Previous reports have been conflicting in the outcomes of these cases. The goals of this retrospective case-control cross-sectional study are to (1)compare the success rate of routine surgical decompression in dogs with DEEHcompression compared to Modified Frankel Score (MFS) matched dogs withnon-hemorrhagic disk extrusions; (2) evaluate the extent of spinal cordcompression on MRI compared to final patient outcomes in DEEH compression and (3)determine the surgical compression to decompression ratio and its relation topatient outcomes in cases of DEEH compression. A total of 143 dogs were included in this study and divided into two groups: DEEH compression dogs (n = 78) andnon-hemorrhagic IVDE dogs (n = 65). Outcomes were assigned for each patient [0 = deceased, 1 = alive and non-ambulatory (MFS 0-3), 2 = alive and ambulatory (MFS 4or 5)] in both groups. Outcomes of DEEH and non-hemorrhagic IVDE did not differwhen taken to surgery with comparable success rates when stratified by MFS.Similarly, outcomes did not differ between DEEH and non-hemorrhagic IVDE dogswhen assessed by compression to decompression ratio. Dogs with DEEH compressionhad more compressed sites than dogs with non-hemorrhagic IVDE (P = 0.001) and hadmore sites decompressed surgically than dogs with non-hemorrhagic IVDE (P <0.001). Consequently, the compression to decompression ratio did not differbetween the two groups (P = 0.52). Our results support the finding that when asimilar level of surgical decompression is achieved, dogs with DEEH compressionhave similar outcomes to dogs with non-hemorrhagic IVDE for similar degrees ofneurological dysfunction.

TI  - Bone density of the humeral condyle in Labrador retrievers with medial coronoidprocess disease.
LID - 10.1111/jsap.13538 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate, using CT imaging, differences in the regional bonedensity of the humeral condyle in Labrador retriever elbows with and withoutmedial coronoid process disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The elbows of LabradorRetrievers that had undergone CT were reviewed. Scans were divided into threecategories: elbows without medial coronoid process disease; elbows with medialcoronoid process disease involving fragmentation of the radial incisure; elbowswith medial coronoid process disease involving fragmentation of the medialcoronoid apex. A templating technique was employed to define the weight-bearingregions of the medial and lateral portion of the humeral condyle and estimates ofvolumetric bone density (defined by Hounsfield unit measurement) were comparedacross the three groups. RESULTS: CT evaluation was performed on 122 elbows in 81dogs. There was a higher mean Hounsfield unit measurement in the medial andlateral portions of the humeral condyles in elbows with medial coronoid processdisease involving fragmentation of the medial coronoid apex compared with elbows with medial coronoid process disease involving fragmentation of the radialincisure. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Dogs with apical fragmentation of the medialcoronoid process exhibited significantly higher estimated bone mineral densitywithin the medial portion of the humeral condyle when compared to dogs withradial incisure fragmentation. The medial portion of the humeral condyle may beassociated with the pathogenesis of apical but not radial incisure medialcoronoid process fragmentation in Labrador Retrievers.

Under general anaesthesia with isoflurane, ethmoidaland maxillary nerve blocks were applied bilaterally using 2% lidocaine beforerhinoscopy in eight dogs (EM group). Six dogs were premedicated withhydromorphone (0.05 mg/kg) as a substitute for local nerve block (H group).During rhinoscopy, the heart rate, arterial blood pressure and end-tidalisoflurane concentration were recorded. The vaporizer setting was adjusted toincrease the end-tidal isoflurane concentration when reflex movement was causedby nasal stimulation. RESULTS: The H group, compared to the EM group, had anincrease in HR that was 18 beats/minute (95% CI: 11 to 26) higher, an increase inSAP that was 22 mmHg (12 to 31) higher, an increase in MAP that was 15 mmHg (7 to23) higher, an increase in DAP that was 12 mmHg (5 to 19) higher, and an increasein end-tidal isoflurane concentration that was 0.4% (0.3 to 0.5) higher. Headmovement due to endoscope insertion was observed in 5/6 dogs (83.3%) in the Hgroup and 1/8 dogs (12.5%) in the EM group (odds ratio, 0.029; ra95% CI,0.001-0.574). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Compared with administration of 0.05 mg/kghydromorphone, concurrent block of the ethmoidal and maxillary nerves can reduce the cardiovascular response, reflex movement and anaesthetic requirement duringrhinoscopy in dogs.

AB  - Background & objectives: Polio, measles, rubella, influenza and rotavirussurveillance programmes are of great public health importance globally. Virusisolation using cell culture is an integral part of such programmes. Possibility of unintended isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from clinical specimens processed inbiosafety level-2 (BSL-2) laboratories during the above-mentioned surveillanceprogrammes, cannot be ruled out. The present study was conducted to assess thesusceptibility of different cell lines to SARS-CoV-2 used in these programmes.Methods: Replication of SARS-CoV-2 was studied in RD and L20B, Vero/hSLAM, MA-104and Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cell lines, used for the isolation of polio,measles, rubella, rotavirus and influenza viruses, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 at0.01 multiplicity of infection was inoculated and the viral growth was assessedby observation of cytopathic effects followed by real-time reversetranscription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Vero CCL-81 cell line was usedas a positive control. Results: SARS-CoV-2 replicated in Vero/hSLAM, and MA-104cells, whereas it did not replicate in L20B, RD and MDCK cells. Vero/hSLAM, andVero CCL-81 showed rounding, degeneration and detachment of cells; MA-104 cellsalso showed syncytia formation. In qRT-PCR, Vero/hSLAM and MA-104 showed 10(6)and Vero CCL-81 showed 10(7) viral RNA copies per mul. The 50 per cent tissueculture infectious dose titres of Vero/hSLAM, MA-104 and Vero CCL-81 were10(5.54), 10(5.29) and 10(6.45)/ml, respectively. Interpretation & conclusions:Replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero/hSLAM and MA-104 underscores the possibility ofits unintended isolation during surveillance procedures aiming to isolatemeasles, rubella and rotavirus. This could result in accidental exposure to high titres of SARS-CoV-2, which can result in laboratory acquired infections andcommunity risk, highlighting the need for revisiting biosafety measures in publichealth laboratories.

TI  - Bone morphogenetic protein 7 mediates stem cells migration and angiogenesis:therapeutic potential for endogenous pulp regeneration.
PG  - 38
LID - 10.1038/s41368-022-00188-y [doi]
AB  - Pulp loss is accompanied by the functional impairment of defense, sensory, andnutrition supply. The approach based on endogenous stem cells is a potentialstrategy for pulp regeneration. However, endogenous stem cell sources, exogenous regenerative signals, and neovascularization are major difficulties for pulpregeneration based on endogenous stem cells. Therefore, the purpose of ourresearch is to seek an effective cytokines delivery strategy and bioactivematerials to reestablish an ideal regenerative microenvironment for pulpregeneration. In in vitro study, we investigated the effects of Wnt3a,transforming growth factor-beta 1, and bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7) onhuman dental pulp stem cells (h-DPSCs) and human umbilical vein endothelialcells. 2D and 3D culture systems based on collagen gel, matrigel, and gelatinmethacryloyl were fabricated to evaluate the morphology and viability of h-DPSCs.In in vivo study, an ectopic nude mouse model and an in situ beagle dog modelwere established to investigate the possibility of pulp regeneration byimplanting collagen gel loading BMP7. We concluded that BMP7 promoted themigration and odontogenic differentiation of h-DPSCs and vessel formation.Collagen gel maintained the cell adhesion, cell spreading, and cell viability of h-DPSCs in 2D or 3D culture. The transplantation of collagen gel loading BMP7induced vascularized pulp-like tissue regeneration in vivo. The injectableapproach based on collagen gel loading BMP7 might exert promising therapeuticapplication in endogenous pulp regeneration.

TI  - Increases in serum carbonylated protein levels of dogs with hypercortisolism.
LID - 10.1507/endocrj.EJ22-0075 [doi]
AB  - Protein carbonylation is an irreversible and degenerative modification that canbe used to evaluate oxidative stress caused by glucocorticoids. In this study, wefocused on protein carbonylation in dogs with hypercortisolism (HC). Sera sampleswere collected from 14 dogs diagnosed with HC and treated with trilostane, 12dogs with inflammatory diseases (disease control group), and eight clinicallyhealthy dogs. When the carbonylated protein levels were detected by theimmunoblot analysis, one band of approximately 40 kDa was predominantly increasedin the dogs with HC. The band was identified as haptoglobin using the liquidchromatography tandem mass spectrometry method. Furthermore, haptoglobin immunereactivity was higher in the dogs with HC. Although the average proteincarbonylation level of the HC group was not significantly different from that of the other groups, the carbonylation level was significantly higher for the poorlycontrolled HC cases than for the well-controlled HC group. Additionally, theprimary culture of canine hepatocytes was used to clarify the direct effect ofglucocorticoids on protein carbonylation in dog livers. Both the carbonylatedprotein and haptoglobin clearly increased after 72 h. These findings suggest thathaptoglobin and its carbonylated form are increased with canine HC, and that the protein carbonylation ratio and/or haptoglobin level could be related to disease management. These factors could be useful as biomarkers for an oxidative stressreaction, at least in the liver, and for treatment monitoring of HC.

LID - 10.1093/jac/dkac208 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare faecal third-generation cephalosporin-resistant (3GC-R)Escherichia coli isolates from dogs living in a city and in a rural areaapproximately 30 km away; to compare isolates from dogs, cattle and humans inthese regions; and to determine risk factors associated with 3GC-R E. colicarriage in these two cohorts of dogs. METHODS: Six hundred dogs were included,with faecal samples processed to recover 3GC-R E. coli using 2 mg/L cefotaxime.WGS was by Illumina and risk factor analyses were by multivariable linearregression using the results of an owner-completed survey. RESULTS: 3GC-R E. coliwere excreted by 20/303 rural and 31/297 urban dogs. The dominant canine 3GC-R STwas ST963 (blaCMY-2), which also accounted for 25% of CMY-2-producing E. coli in humans. Phylogenetic overlap between cattle and rural dog CTX-M-14-producing E.coli ST117 was observed as well as acquisition of pMOO-32-positive E. coli ST10by a rural dog, a plasmid common on cattle farms in the area. Feeding raw meatwas associated with carrying 3GC-R E. coli in rural dogs, but not in urban dogs, where swimming in rivers was a weak risk factor. CONCLUSIONS: Given clearzoonotic potential for resistant canine E. coli, our work suggests interventions that may reduce this threat. In rural dogs, carriage of 3GC-R E. coli,particularly CTX-M producers, was phylogenetically associated with interactionwith local cattle and epidemiologically associated with feeding raw meat. Inurban dogs, sources of 3GC-R E. coli appear to be more varied and includeenvironments such as rivers.

AB  - The aim of this study was to characterize Leishmania spp. from canine and feline samples using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)- Restriction Fragment LengthPolymorphism (RFLP). It was conducted in the southern region of Brazil, locatedat border crossings to Argentina and Uruguay. Samples were collected from 116dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) and 89 cats (Felis catus). The PCR was performed toscreen for an LT1 fragment from kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) target gene, and positive samples were subjected to a second PCR for an internal transcribed spacers (ITS1)region from ribosomal DNA (rDNA) target. RFLP was performed using the Haemophilusaegyptius (HAE III) restriction endonuclease (Fermentas (R)). Positive samples byPCR ITS1 were sequenced and deposited in NCBI GenBank, and a phylogeneticanalysis was developed. We found that 12.9% (15/116) of the samples from dogswere positive. All the 89 cat samples were negative. Positive samples were testedagainst Leishmania reference strains presenting different patterns in PCR-RFLP,and these samples showed bands denoting similarity to the standard species ofLeishmania infantum, proven through sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. TheRFLP technique, alone, was shown to be feasible for practical application andconfirmation of the involved Leishmania spp.

TI  - A Novel Canine Otoscopy Teaching Model for Veterinary Students.
PG  - e20220015
LID - 10.3138/jvme-2022-0015 [doi]
AB  - Otoscopic evaluation using an otoscope is an important tool among the diagnostic modalities for otitis externa and is considered a core component of a caninepatient's complete physical examination. Traditionally, otoscopic training inveterinary school involves using live dogs (i.e., laboratory dogs or dogs thatare patients of the veterinary teaching hospital). While this approach has itsadvantages, performing otoscopic examination on live dogs presents severalchallenges: it requires adequate patient restraint, can cause stress to the dog, and can potentially cause trauma and/or injury to the dog's ear canal whenperformed by an inexperienced individual. Using an alternative teaching tool for otoscopic evaluation could overcome these challenges and improve veterinarystudents' learning experience. In this study, we investigated student perceptionsof a novel canine teaching model for otoscopic evaluation in first-yearveterinary students. The Elnady preservation technique was employed to create arealistic, durable, and flexible model for otoscopic training in a dermatologylaboratory session in a first-year veterinary course. Student feedback wasassessed on a Likert scale, and overall feedback indicated that students feltthat the model was beneficial for skill building and removed many of thestressors incurred with using live animals when training in clinical skills. Moststudents stated that they would like to have additional similar modelsincorporated into training and would recommend these models to other students.

TI  - Defucosylated mousedog chimeric antiHER2 monoclonal antibody exerts antitumoractivities in mouse xenograft models of canine tumors.
LID - 10.3892/or.2022.8366 [doi]
LID - 154 [pii]
AB  - Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression has been reported in various types of cancer, including breast, gastric, lung, colorectal andpancreatic cancer. A humanized antiHER2 monoclonal antibody (mAb), trastuzumab,has been shown to improve survival of patients in HER2positive breast and gastriccancer. An antiHER2 mAb, H2Mab77 (mouse IgG1, kappa) was previously developed. Inthe present study, a defucosylated version of mousedog chimeric antiHER2 mAb(H77Bf) was generated. H77Bf possesses a high bindingaffinity [a dissociationconstant (KD): 7.5x10(10) M, as determined by flow cytometric analysis] for dogHER2overexpressed CHOK1 (CHO/dHER2) cells. H77Bf highly exerted antibodydependentcellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complementdependent cytotoxicity (CDC) forCHO/dHER2 cells by canine mononuclear cells and complement, respectively.Moreover, administration of H77Bf significantly suppressed the development ofCHO/dHER2 xenograft tumor in mice compared with the control dog IgG. H77Bf alsopossesses a high bindingaffinity (KD: 7.2x10(10) M) for a canine mammary glandtumor cell line (SNP), and showed high ADCC and CDC activities for SNP cells.Intraperitoneal administration of H77Bf in mouse xenograft models of SNPsignificantly suppressed the development of SNP xenograft tumors compared withthe control dog IgG. These results indicated that H77Bf exerts antitumoractivities against dHER2positive canine cancers, and could be valuable treatment regimen for canine cancers.

TI  - Inter-pathologist agreement on diagnosis, classification and grading of canineglioma.
LID - 10.1111/vco.12853 [doi]
AB  - Histopathological evaluation of tumors is a subjective process, but studies ofinter-pathologist agreement are uncommon in veterinary medicine. The Comparative Brain Tumour Consortium (CBTC) recently published diagnostic criteria for canine gliomas. Our objective was to assess the degree of inter-pathologist agreement onintracranial canine gliomas, utilising the CBTC diagnostic criteria in a cohortof eighty-five samples from dogs with an archival diagnosis of intracranialglioma. Five pathologists independently reviewed H&E and immunohistochemistrysections and provided a diagnosis and grade. Percentage agreement and kappastatistics were calculated to measure inter-pathologist agreement between pairsand amongst the entire group. A consensus diagnosis of glioma subtype and gradewas achieved for 71/85 (84%) cases. For these cases, percentage agreement oncombined diagnosis (subtype and grade), subtype only and grade only were 66%, 80%and 82%, respectively. Kappa statistics for the same were 0.466, 0.542 and 0.516,respectively. Kappa statistics for oligodendroglioma, astrocytoma and undefinedglioma were 0.585, 0.566 and 0.280 and were 0.516 for both low-grade andhigh-grade tumors. Kappa statistics amongst pairs of pathologists for combineddiagnosis varied from 0.352 to 0.839. 8 % of archival oligodendrogliomas and 61% of archival astrocytomas were reclassified as another entity after review.Inter-pathologist agreement utilising CBTC guidelines for canine glioma wasmoderate overall but varied from fair to almost perfect between pairs ofpathologists. Agreement was similar for oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas butlower for undefined gliomas. These results are similar to pathologist agreementin human glioma studies and with other tumor entities in veterinary medicine.

TI  - Animal-Assisted Counseling for Young Children: Evidence Base, Best Practices, andFuture Prospects.
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1007/s10643-022-01368-5 [doi]
AB  - Increasing numbers of young children are experiencing mild to moderate mentalhealth issues that require support in addition to that typically provided byfamily members and teachers. The services of professional counselors can beparticularly useful when children need help adjusting to and coping with various stressors and situations. Many school counselors and other mental healthprofessionals have found that carefully planned interactions between youngchildren and animals (e.g., guinea pigs, rabbits, dogs, horses) represent aneffective alternative/complementary therapeutic modality. Animals may provide an accepting, nonjudgmental presence that focuses young children's attention,motivates them to learn, and encourages participation in planned interventionactivities. This article begins by describing the general purposes for counselingwith young children and the role that early childhood educators can play inincreasing families' awareness of and access to these services in theircommunities. Next, it defines animal-assisted counseling and reviews the relevantresearch to build a rationale for including carefully selected animals in mental health support services for children. The third section discusses caveats aboutinvolving animals in individual and small group counseling sessions, inclassrooms, and in other facilities/programs that work with young children. Thearticle then summarizes best practices in animal-assisted counseling and how theyare influenced by variables within the child, animal welfare considerations,different contexts, availability of resources, and interagency collaborations.The conclusion is a statement on the future of animal-assisted counseling foryoung children and how it supports the goals of humane education.

TI  - Multiple mechanisms shape the relationship between pathway and duration of focal seizures.

AB  - A seizure's electrographic dynamics are characterized by its spatiotemporalevolution, also termed dynamical 'pathway', and the time it takes to completethat pathway, which results in the seizure's duration. Both seizure pathways and durations have been shown to vary within the same patient. However, it is unclearwhether seizures following the same pathway will have the same duration or ifthese features can vary independently. We compared within-subject variability in these seizure features using (i) epilepsy monitoring unit intracranial EEG (iEEG)recordings of 31 patients (mean: 6.7 days, 16.5 seizures/subject), (ii)NeuroVista chronic iEEG recordings of 10 patients (mean: 521.2 days, 252.6seizures/subject) and (iii) chronic iEEG recordings of three dogs withfocal-onset seizures (mean: 324.4 days, 62.3 seizures/subject). While thestrength of the relationship between seizure pathways and durations was highlysubject-specific, in most subjects, changes in seizure pathways were only weakly to moderately associated with differences in seizure durations. The relationship between seizure pathways and durations was strengthened by seizures that were'truncated' versions, both in pathway and duration, of other seizures. However,the relationship was weakened by seizures that had a common pathway, butdifferent durations ('elasticity'), or had similar durations, but followeddifferent pathways ('semblance'). Even in subjects with distinct populations ofshort and long seizures, seizure durations were not a reliable indicator ofdifferent seizure pathways. These findings suggest that seizure pathways anddurations are modulated by multiple different mechanisms. Uncovering suchmechanisms may reveal novel therapeutic targets for reducing seizure duration andseverity.

TI  - Comparison of assessment of coagulation in healthy dogs by the TEG 6s and TEG5000 viscoelastic analyzers.
PG  - 10406387221112638
LID - 10.1177/10406387221112638 [doi]
AB  - The TEG 6s (Haemonetics) point-of-care viscoelastic analyzer is portable,compact, simple to use, and has the potential for rapid viscoelastic analysisthat can guide the treatment of veterinary patients at the site of care. Althoughapproved for use in people, the TEG 6s has yet to be evaluated for hemostaticanalysis in veterinary medicine. Citrated whole blood (CWB) was collected from 27healthy dogs. An aliquot of CWB from each dog was diluted by 33% with an isotoniccrystalloid, representing an in vitro model of hemodilution. Unaltered anddiluted CWB samples were analyzed using 2 TEG 6s and 6 TEG 5000 (Haemonetics)analyzers. The 6 TEG 5000 analyzers ran duplicate analyses of either unaltered ordiluted samples using 1 of 3 reagents (Haemonetics): Kaolin TEG, RapidTEG, or TEGFunctional Fibrinogen. Duplicate TEG 5000 analyses were averaged and comparedwith a single TEG 6s analysis. Lin concordance correlation coefficient andBland-Altman plots were used to evaluate agreement of reaction time, kinetictime, alpha angle, maximum amplitude (MA), and G value (G) for samples activated with Kaolin TEG, and agreement of MA for samples activated with RapidTEG between the 2 machines. Overall, agreement between the TEG 6s and TEG 5000 analyzers was poor. Viscoelastic measurements by the TEG 6s and TEG 5000 in healthy dogs werenot all interchangeable. Agreement was satisfactory only for MA and Gmeasurements of diluted blood samples activated with Kaolin TEG, and MAmeasurements for both unaltered and diluted blood samples activated withRapidTEG.

TI  - Usefulness of squash preparation cytology in the diagnosis of canine urinarybladder carcinomas.
LID - 10.1111/vcp.13151 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epithelial cells show varying degrees of cytologic atypia in dogswith nonmalignant lesions (NML) and carcinomas (ubC) of the bladder, makinghistopathologic examination necessary for a definitive diagnosis. OBJECTIVES:This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic performance of squash preparation cytology and identify several cytomorphologic features of ubC to assist indiagnoses. METHODS: Squash preparations were made and reviewed in dogs thatunderwent transurethral cystoscopy. The results were compared withhistopathologic diagnoses. Two cytopathologists performed blinded assessmentsusing a scoring system established for 11 cytologic features, including thepresence of macronuclei, abnormal nucleoli, atypical mitoses, signet ring cells, multinucleated cells, nuclear molding, anisokaryosis, cytoplasmaticmicrovacuolization, cell arrangements, and neutrophil and lymphocyteinfiltrations. Based on cytologic and histopathologic diagnoses, dogs weredivided into ubC and NML groups. Associations between cytologic andhistopathologic diagnoses were investigated, and agreement between thecytopathologists was calculated. Cytologic features were analyzed withmultivariate logistic regression models. The performance of predictors in thefinal model was evaluated in terms of Sensitivity (Se), Specificity (Sp),accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV),likelihood ratio positive (LR+), and negative (LR-) values, and the diagnosticodds ratio (DOR). RESULTS: Forty-four dogs diagnosed with ubC, and 17 with NMLwere included in the study. Cytologic and histopathologic diagnoses weresignificantly associated with each cytopathologist. There was an almost perfectagreement between cytopathologists (kappa = 0.88). The absence of neutrophilicinfiltration, the presence of multinucleated cells, and nuclear molding wereassociated with ubC; using a combination of these features in parallel testingresulted in Se = 0.98, Sp = 0.65, accuracy = 0.89, PPV = 0.88, NPV = 0.92, LR +=2.77, LR- = 0.04, and DOR = 7.7. CONCLUSIONS: Squash preparation cytology could be a reliable technique to diagnose ubC in dogs. The best diagnostic combination was the absence of neutrophilic infiltration, multinucleated cells, and nuclearmolding.

TI  - Validation of a dry-slide immunoassay for progesterone analysis in canine plasma in a clinical setting.
LID - 10.1111/vcp.13140 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The identification of canine ovulation is critical for successfulbreeding. Progesterone measurements are useful for identifying ovulation.Progesterone assays are also quantitative and easily accessed, making themvaluable in veterinary practice. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to validate a dry-slideimmunoassay (DSI) for use in dogs, including a method comparison with thechemiluminescence assay (CLIA) and mass spectrometry. METHODS: Twenty-ninebitches were prospectively recruited. Accuracy, precision, interference, andstability were evaluated. Method comparison between DSI and CLIA and massspectrometry was conducted, and bias was calculated. RESULTS: Repeatability was8.0%-10.8%, and within-laboratory imprecision was 8.8%-11.1% for fourconcentration levels. Recovery under dilution was 61%-100%, and the method waslinear to a concentration of ~50 nmol/L. Recovery after the addition of a highprogesterone sample was 76%-83%. Minor changes were seen in one hemolytic and twolipemic samples. Storage at room temperature for 12-24 hours resulted inconcentrations that were 57%-96% of the initial concentrations. For samplesfrozen at -80 degrees C, the concentrations were reduced 17%-27%. There was asignificant difference between results from the DSI and CLIA, and a proportional bias was seen when DSI was compared with mass spectrometry, where CLIA correlatedbetter than DSI. CONCLUSIONS: Precision and accuracy were acceptable. Aproportional bias was seen between DSI and CLIA. A small amount of interferencewas seen with hemolysis and lipemia. Progesterone concentrations were decreasedin samples stored at room temperature and -80 degrees C. The results support the use of the DSI for ovulation timing but not for artificial insemination withfrozen semen since progesterone concentrations might exceed the assay's linearityand precision limits.

PG  - 282
LID - 10.1186/s12917-022-03348-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Echocardiographic measurements may be influenced by breed-specificcharacteristics. Therefore, this study aims to establish reference values forstandard echocardiographic measurements in pugs by investigating the influence ofage, sex, heart rate, body weight and Brachycephalic Obstructive Airway Syndrome (BOAS). Sixty-two privately owned pugs underwent physical examination, bloodsample collection, non-invasive blood pressure measurements and echocardiography.Influences of independent variables on echocardiographic measurements wereexamined using a multiple linear regression analysis model. For the entire study population, 95% prediction intervals were generated. Further, reference rangesfor subcategories of clinical severities of BOAS were provided. Selectedechocardiographic measurements of pugs were compared to reference values ofprevious studies generated from various breeds. RESULTS: In the study, a total offifty-one privately owned pugs aged between two and 10 years were included forestablishing reference ranges. Mainly body weight, but also age, sex and heartrate had influence on several echocardiographic parameters. The clinical grading of BOAS was conducted in 42 pugs. Except for pulmonic peak velocity (Pvel), whichdeclined with increasing severity of BOAS, clinical symptoms of upper airwaydisease did not have significant impact on echocardiographic measurement results.Significant deviations, however, of left ventricular (LV) internal dimension(LVID), interventricular septum (IVS), LV posterior wall (LVPW), and tricuspidannular plane systolic motion excursion (TAPSE) compared to interbreed reference values were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Breed-specific reference ranges forechocardiographic values with special regard to BOAS are provided to enable amore accurate assessment of cardiac health in pugs.

TI  - Metabolism of Speciociliatine, an Overlooked Kratom Alkaloid for its PotentialPharmacological Effects.
PG  - 86
LID - 10.1208/s12248-022-00736-8 [doi]
AB  - Speciociliatine, a diastereomer of mitragynine, is an indole-based alkaloid foundin kratom (Mitragyna speciosa). Kratom has been widely used for the mitigation ofpain and opioid dependence, as a mood enhancer, and/or as an energy booster.Speciociliatine is a partial micro-opioid agonist with a 3-fold higher bindingaffinity than mitragynine. Speciociliatine has been found to be a majorcirculating alkaloid in humans following oral administration of a kratom product.In this report, we have characterized the metabolism of speciociliatine in human and preclinical species (mouse, rat, dog, and cynomolgus monkey) liver microsomesand hepatocytes. Speciociliatine metabolized rapidly in monkey, rat, and mousehepatocytes (in vitro half-life was 6.6 +/- 0.2, 8.3 +/- 1.1, 11.2 +/- 0.7 min,respectively), while a slower metabolism was observed in human and doghepatocytes (91.7 +/- 12.8 and > 120 min, respectively). Speciociliatineunderwent extensive metabolism, primarily through monooxidation andO-demethylation metabolic pathways in liver microsomes and hepatocytes acrossspecies. No human-specific or disproportionate metabolites of speciociliatinewere found in human liver microsomes. The metabolism of speciociliatine waspredominantly mediated by CYP3A4 with minor contributions by CYP2D6.

AB  - At present, avian-origin H3N2 subtype canine influenza virus (H3N2 CIV) isprevalent in East Asian and North American countries. The host tropism of H3N2CIV to mammals, including mice, guinea pigs, ferrets, and pigs, has beenevaluated. However, it has not previously been determined whether avian-originH3N2 CIV can be transmitted back to birds. In China, ducks, chickens, geese,pigeons, and quails are economically important domestic poultry that aresusceptible to numerous subtypes of influenza A virus. These poultry occasionallyor frequently come into contact with dogs. In this study, the infectivity of the first- and last-isolated Chinese H3N2 CIV strains in these poultry species wasevaluated, and oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs of these animals were negative forvirus, as determined by specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicken egg inoculation and real-time RT-qPCR assays. Clinical signs and gross lesions were not observed inany of these species, and seroconversion also did not occur. The results showedthat all these avian species were unsusceptible to the first- and last-isolatedH3N2 CIVs, indicating unidirectional evolution of the mammalian host tropism ofH3N2 CIV.

AB  - This study investigated the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility ofenterococci isolated from dogs and cats with urinary tract infections innorthwestern Croatia. During this study, the laboratory received 787 urinesamples, 651 from dogs and 136 from cats. A total of 260 urine samples (211 from dogs and 49 from cats) were bacteriologically positive. Of these, 29 isolatesbelonged to Enterococcus spp.; 22 from dogs and seven from cats. Enterococciisolates were identified by PCR method, 12 of which were Enterococcus faecium and17 were Enterococcus faecalis species. In dogs, 16 E. faecalis and six E. faeciumstrains were identified, whereas in cats, six E. faecium and only one E. faecalisstrain were identified. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by theKirby-Bauer disk diffusion method for nine antimicrobials: penicillin,ampicillin, vancomycin, nitrofurantoin, rifampicin, tetracycline,chloramphenicol, enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin. The isolates were tested forhigh-level resistance to streptomycin and gentamicin. The highest resistance ofEnterococcus spp. was observed to rifampicin (86%) and enrofloxacin (83%),followed by tetracycline and ciprofloxacin (69%). Resistance to vancomycin was28%, and the lowest resistance was to chloramphenicol (17%). Multidrug resistancewas found in 76% of enterococci isolates. High-level streptomycin resistance was detected in 17% and high-level gentamicin resistance in 10% of the isolatedenterococci. When comparing species susceptibility, E. faecium isolates weresignificantly more resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, nitrofurantoin, andciprofloxacin (p < 0.05). Eleven E. faecium isolates (92%) and 12 E. faecalisisolates (76%) were multidrug resistant.

AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of 30 days treatmentof undenatured type II collagen(UC-II(R)), compared to cimicoxib and to theircombination, in osteoarthritic dogs. Client-owned dogs were enrolled in aclinical, randomized, controlled and prospective study. Posture, lameness, pain, range of motion and x-ray of affected joint(s) were evaluated and scored based onseverity (CLINICAL score). The Liverpool Osteoarthritis in Dogs survey was usedto score the owner evaluation of dog's mobility (LOAD score and MOBILITY score). Osteoarthritis (OA) stage was defined through the Canine Osteoarthritis Stagingtool (COAST). After diagnosis (T0), all patients were randomly assigned todifferent treatment groups: C group = cimicoxib 2 mg/kg/day orally OS, F group = UC-II(R) 1 tablet per day OS; C + F group = cimicoxib-UC-II(R) at the sameprevious dosages; CTR group = dogs who didn't received any treatment. Alltreatments were administered for 30 days. Seventy-six dogs completed the study.LOAD score was recorded significant lower after treatment for each group, with a reduction in percentage of 29.5% for C, 31.4% for F, 21.1% for C + F. LOAD score was lower in C(P = 0.04), F(P = 0.001) and C + F(P = 0.009) group at T30 than CTRgroup. MOBILITY and CLINICAL scores were significantly lower in all groups atT30, when compared to T0. MOBILITY score was lower than CTR in C(P = 0.02) andF(P = 0.01); CLINICAL score was lower in C + F(P = 0.016). The present findingsprove that the treatment with UC-II(R), cimicoxib and their combination providesignificant reduction in clinical signs associated with OA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cysticercosis and Neurocysticercosis (NCC) can be studied usingseveral animal species in experimental models which contributes to theunderstanding of the human form of the disease. Experimental infections of Taeniaspp. are vital in explaining the modes of transmission of the parasite and helps the understanding of transmission of the parasite in humans and thus may beuseful in designing therapeutic and immune-prophylactic studies to combat thedisease. Thus, this systematic review aims to explore the existing experimentalanimal models to the understanding of cysticercosis in both humans and animalsand elucidate the risk factors of cysticercosis and identify the Taenia spp. usedin these models. METHODOLOGY: We systematically identified all publications from the Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Pubmed regarding experimental animalmodels using Taenia spp. that cause cysticercosis in both humans and animals. 58 studies were identified for eligibility. Of these, only 48 studies met theinclusion criteria from which data extraction was done and presenteddescriptively. RESULTS: Pigs, cattle, gerbils, mice, rats, voles, monkeys, cats, dogs, and goats were used in which T. solium, T. saginata, T. saginata asiatica, T. crassiceps and T. asiatica were studied. The routes used to induce diseasewere; oral, intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal,intraarterial, intracranial, intraduodenal, and surgical routes using eggs,oncospheres, and proglottids. Besides, the establishment of infection using eggs and oncospheres was affected by the route used to induce infection in theexperimental animals. The cysticerci recovery rate in all the experimentalstudies was low and the number of animals used in these experiments varied from 1to 84. Although not analysed statistically, sex, age, and breed of animalsinfluenced the cysticerci recovery rate. Additionally, the cysticerci recoveryrate and antibody-antigen levels were shown to increase with an increase in thedose of oncospheres and eggs inoculated in the animals. Contrasting results were reported in which the cysticerci recovery rate decreased with an increase in the dose of eggs inoculated. CONCLUSION: This review describes the various animalexperiments using Taenia species that cause cysticercosis highlighting theanimals used, age and their breed, the routes of infection used to induce diseaseand the sample size used, and the cysticerci recovery rate in these animalmodels.

AB  - Rabies remains a public health problem in the Philippines despite the widespread provision of rabies vaccines and rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) as post-exposureprophylaxis (PEP). Detailed descriptions of recent human rabies cases in thePhilippines are scarce. This study aimed to describe the clinical,epidemiological, and spatial features of human rabies cases between January 1,2006, and December 31, 2015. We conducted a retrospective hospital-based caserecord review of all patients admitted to one referral hospital in Manila whoreceived a clinical diagnosis of rabies. During the 10-year study period therewere 575 patients (average 57.5 cases per year, range 57 to 119) with a finaldiagnosis of rabies. Most patients were male (n = 404, 70.3%) and aged >/= 20years (n = 433, 75.3%). Patients mostly came from the National Capital Region (n = 160, 28.0%) and the adjacent Regions III (n = 197, 34.4%) and IV-A (n = 168,29.4%). Case mapping and heatmaps showed that human rabies cases werecontinuously observed in similar areas throughout the study period. Most patientshad hydrophobia (n = 444, 95.5%) and/or aerophobia (n = 432, 93.3%). The leading causative animals were dogs (n = 421, 96.3%) and cats (n = 16, 3.7%). Among 437patients with animal exposure history, only 42 (9.6%) had been administered atleast one rabies vaccine. Two patients (0.5%), young children bitten on theirface, had received and a full course of rabies vaccine. Human rabies patientswere continuously admitted to the hospital, with no notable decline over thestudy period. The geographical area in which human rabies cases commonly occurredalso did not change. Few patients received PEP and there were two suspected casesof PEP failure. The retrospective design of this study was a limitation; thus,prospective studies are required.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate the symptoms, skeletal manifestations,and management of patients with tumor-like osseous hydatidosis treated in ouroncology clinic in the long term and to share our clinical experience with thisextremely rare disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 2010 and May 2019,a total of 11 patients (6 males, 5 females; mean age: 45.1+/-13 years; range, 22 to 70 years) who were treated with a bone hydatid cyst (HC) and followed wereretrospectively analyzed. Epidemiological, clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic data of the patients with long-term follow-up were collected. RESULTS: The meanfollow-up was 63.2+/-23.9 (range, 24 to 101) months. The most common site of bonehydatidosis was the femur in four (36%) patients. The most common clinicalpresentation was pain in seven (63.6%) patients. Two (18.2%) patients had apathological fracture of the femur. It was detected incidentally in two patients.Contact history was present in two patients (with dog), and two (18.2%) patients had concomitant extraosseous cystic echinococcosis in the liver. Complete bloodcount analysis was performed in all patients and eosinophilia was positive inthree (27.3%) patients. As treatment, curettage cementation was performed in nine(81%) patients (internal fixation was also applied to five of them), while wideresection and prosthesis were applied to two (18.2%) patients. CONCLUSION: Thediagnosis of osseous hydatidosis is difficult and the prognosis is often poor.This entity should be kept in mind for the differential diagnosis of the cysticor tumoral lesions of the bone.

TI  - Comparison of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and cyclooxygenase-2(COX-2) immunohistochemical expression and outcomes in canine nasal carcinomastreated with radiation therapy.
LID - 10.1292/jvms.22-0106 [doi]
AB  - The expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and cyclooxygenase-2(COX-2) has been reported in human nasopharyngeal and canine nasal carcinomas.The present study measured EGFR and COX-2 expression and calculated correlations between these proteins and clinical variables and outcomes in dogs with nasalcarcinoma treated with radiation therapy. Before treatment, theimmunohistochemistry of EGFR and COX-2 was performed in 67 biopsied tissues from canine nasal carcinomas. The correlations between these protein levels, clinical variables, and outcomes were evaluated. EGFR and COX-2 were detected in 88.1% and82.1% of our samples, respectively. Neither EGFR nor COX-2 was associated with T stage and cribriform plate destruction. Dogs with low EGFR levels had asignificantly longer survival time than dogs with high EGFR expression (P=0.043).The COX-2 expression level was not significantly associated with survival timesafter radiation therapy (P=0.653). Overexpression of EGFR is negativelycorrelated with survival in dogs with nasal carcinoma. Future studies shouldidentify tumor biomarkers to develop therapeutic targets for effective treatmentsfor canine nasal carcinomas.

AB  - Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a chronic and represented by insulin-causingpancreatic beta-cell disruption and hyperglycemia. N-Acetyl-Cysteine (NAC) isregarded as facilitating endothelial cell function and angiogenesis and may have treatment effect in the case of diabetes. However, the impact of NAC on T1DM are unknown. Here we reported that inflammatory pathogenesis of canine type 1diabetes liver disease and the therapeutic effect of NAC combined with insulin.For this purpose, the model was established by intravenous injection ofstreptozotocin (20 mg/kg). Forty adult dogs were used and divided into 5 groups: control group, DM group, insulin treatment group, NAC combined with insulintherapy, and NAC group, while study lasted for 16 weeks. Results showed that the level of liver function enzyme activity were apparently increased in DM group,while the NAC with insulin treatment remarkable decreased liver function enzymelevels. Histopathology revealed that obvious changes in liver structure of all DMgroup, as evidenced by hepatocyte disorder and cellular swelling. Liver structurewas evaluated by Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) and Masson staining, the tissuesappeared glycogen deposition and collagen deposition, indicating that DMaggravated liver injury. Compared with control group, the protein and mRNAexpression of NLRP3, Caspase-1, ASC, and GSDMD were significantly induced in the DM group, while INS and NAC combined with INS treatment reversed the abovechanges. The levels of NF-kappaB P65, p-NF-kappaB, and IFN gamma were availablyenhanced in the DM group, which decreased through insulin and NAC combined withinsulin treatment. This study demonstrated that NAC combined with INS exertedprotective effects against STZ-induced liver injury by inhibiting theNLRP3/NF-kappaB pathway. The findings indicated that NAC combined with INS mayserve as a potential candidate therapy for the treatment of T1DM.

AB  - Human alveolar echinococcosis is caused by the parasite Echinococcusmultilocularis, and dog ownership has been identified as a risk factor. We soughtto specify the factors of dog ownership underlying this risk by conducting acase-control study among dog owners in Germany. The analysis revealed anincreased odds ratio of approximately 7-fold for dog owners whose dogs roamunattended in fields, 13-fold for dog owners who feed their dogs organic wastedaily, 4-fold for dog owners who take their dog to a veterinarian only in case ofillness, and 10-fold for dog owners who have never been informed by aveterinarian about the risk for infection. The results highlight the risk forinfection associated with various factors of dog ownership and the value ofveterinarians informing owners about prevention.

TI  - The Role of Tibial Plateau Angle in Canine Cruciate Ligament Rupture-A Review of the Literature.
LID - 10.1055/s-0042-1750316 [doi]
AB  - Cranial cruciate ligament disease is a common pathological condition in dogs thatis often presented in daily clinical practice. Different risk factors for thedevelopment of this condition include breed, sex, age, bodyweight and neuterstatus, as well as different biological and biomechanical mechanisms. In theliterature, special attention has been paid to the role of the tibial plateauangle in damage to the cranial cruciate ligament. Although the disease was first described at the beginning of last century, and since then different surgicalmethods have been developed to treat it, its aetiology remains unclear. In thisreview, contemporary literature data related to the role of tibial plateau angle in canine cranial cruciate ligament rupture are presented.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study provides a morphometric assessment of the medial collateral ligament (MCL) of the canine stifle joint. STUDY DESIGN: Eighty-six stifle jointswere collected from 43 canine cadavers and dissected to free them of soft tissue and expose the collateral ligaments. The MCL insertion sites were identified withChinese ink on intact stifle joints and also marked with radiopaque paste afterremoval of the MCL. Mediolateral photographs and radiographs of each stifle jointwere taken after MCL was removed for morphometric assessment. Measurements weretaken in two groups: a group of Beagles (group 1), and a group composed ofdifferent breeds (group 2). RESULTS: In all stifle joints, the MCL had anhourglass shape. It inserted in the distal femur and the proximal tibia, and was also intimately attached to the medial meniscus and more loosely to the proximal tibial epiphysis in its central portion. The MCL tibial insertion (TI) site hadthe largest surface area. Its proximal and distal position relative to the tibialplateau was located at 8.24 +/- 1.17% and 15.54 +/- 1.50% respectively of thetotal tibial length in group 1, and at 8.86 +/- 1.93% and 15.53 +/- 2.11%respectively, of the total tibial length in group 2. These values were notstatistically different. CONCLUSION: The MCL of the canine stifle joint has aninsertion site on the femur and on the tibia and is also attached on the medialmeniscus. The location of the MCL TI site seems to be relatively homogeneous indogs.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to establish a reliable andreproducible method to isolate and cultivate canine corneal epithelial andstromal cells (cCECs and cCSCs). The cells were subsequently used for in vitrotesting of topically applied diluted povidone iodine (PVI). METHODS: Corneas ofdogs, euthanized for reasons unrelated to this study, were used to collectprimary cCECs and cCSCs. Corneas were enzymatically digested and explantsobtained using biopsy punches. Epithelial and stromal explants were separatelytaken into culture. Cell proliferation and migration was evaluated afterincubation of cCECs and cCSCs with PVI in different concentrations (1, 2, or 5%) and with different exposure times (1, 3, or 10 min). RESULTS: Solely incubationof 4 mm diameter corneal epithelial explants in a 48-well culture plate in fullmedium led to sufficient growth of cCECs. Up to four passages were achieved with a cell density of 10,000-20,000 cells/cm(2) after dissociation of cells intrypsin for 8 min. Cell detachment and passaging for cCSCs were possible withalmost every cornea and explant. Canine CSCs were less sensitive to PVI in allconcentrations and over time than cCECs. Epithelial and stromal cellproliferation and migration decreased with increasing exposure times and PVIconcentrations across all groups. CONCLUSIONS: The described method is astraightforward and sound way to isolate and cultivate cCECs and cCSCs in vitro. Basic information on cCEC and cCSC migration and proliferation after incubationwith PVI, was gathered. The results may provide a step towards an optimalpreoperative antisepsis protocol for ophthalmic surgery in future.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the postoperative analgesic and antioxidanteffects of butorphanol given in the preoperative or early postoperative period.Twenty-seven healthy female dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy were randomlydivided into three groups as before surgery group (BSG, n = 7) receivedbutorphanol 30 min before preanesthetic administration, after surgery group (ASG,n = 10) received butorphanol during the last skin suture and the control group(CG, n = 10) received no butorphanol. Pain was assessed with short form of theGlasgow composite pain scale (CMPS-SF). Serum concentration of malondialdehyde(MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase activities (GPx)were quantified by spectrophotometric methods to assess oxidative stress status. The pain score increased rapidly at 1 h after surgery and then decreasedgradually towards to 24 h in all groups. There was no statistical differenceamong the groups in terms of CMPS-SF scores (P > 0.05). Serum concentration ofMDA was lower in ASG than in BSG and CG from 1 h to 24 h after surgery. Serumactivity of GPx was higher in ASG than in BSG and CG from 2 h to 24 h (P < 0.05).Serum activity of SOD was higher in ASG than in BSG and CG from 1 h to 24 h aftersurgery (P < 0.05). Serum SOD activity at different time points in ASG did notdiffer compared to preoperative level though it decreased significantly from 1 h onwards both in CT and BSG. The results indicate that single butorphanoladministration either before or after the operation might not provide sufficient analgesia, however, it seems that it has antioxidant potential and may protecttissues by reducing oxidative stress when administered early postoperative periodfollowing ovariohysterectomy.

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the safety, feasibility, and outcomes of High-IntensityFocused Ultrasound (HIFU) for the treatment of solid tumors in a spontaneouscanine cancer model. METHODS: Dogs diagnosed with subcutaneous solid tumors were recruited, staged and pretreatment biopsies were obtained. A single HIFUtreatment was delivered to result in partial tumor ablation using a commercially available HIFU unit. Tumors were resected 3-6 days post HIFU and samples obtainedfor histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Total RNA was isolated from pairedpre and post treated FFPE tumor samples, and quantitative gene expressionanalysis was performed using the nCounter Canine IO Panel. RESULTS: A total of 20dogs diagnosed with solid tumors were recruited and treated in the study. Tumors treated included Soft Tissue Sarcoma (n = 15), Mast Cell Tumor (n = 3),Osteosarcoma (n = 1), and Thyroid Carcinoma (n = 1). HIFU was well tolerated withonly 1 dog experiencing a clinically significant adverse event. Pathologyconfirmed the presence of complete tissue ablation at the HIFU targeted site and immunohistochemistry indicated immune cell infiltration at the treated/untreated tumor border. Quantitative gene expression analysis indicated that 28 genesassociated with T-cell activation were differentially expressed post-HIFU.CONCLUSIONS: HIFU appears to be safe and feasible for the treatment ofsubcutaneous canine solid tumors, resulting in ablation of the targeted tissue.HIFU induced immunostimulatory changes, highlighting the canine cancer patient asan attractive model for studying the effects of focal ablation therapies on thetumor microenvironment.

TI  - The Effect of Increasing Tibial Tuberosity Advancement and Quadriceps MuscleForce on Cranial Translation of the Tibia in the Cranial Cruciate DeficientStifle Joint in Dogs.
PG  - 914763
LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.914763 [doi]
AB  - Background: Cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) disease is a well-known pathologythat generates both rotational and translational instability of the stifle joint that leads to osteoarthritis in dogs. Tibial tuberosity advancement (TTA) is acommon surgical technique used to dynamically neutralize the tibiofemoral shearforces to achieve stifle joint stability. However, significant persistentinstability has been documented in clinical cases. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of increasing quadriceps load, increasing tibialtuberosity advancement, and increasing joint flexion angle on the cranialtranslation of the tibia relative to the femur in the cranial cruciate ligamentdeficient stifle joint. Methods and Results: Six cadaveric hind limbs werecollected from six healthy mixed breed dogs of medium build and prepared forbiomechanical testing. The specimen was placed into a custom-made joint testingmachine, and translation of the tibia relative to the femur was measured atstifle angles of 135 degrees , 120 degrees , and 105 degrees . Cranial tibialthrust was generated by applying a vertical load to the metatarsal pad and thequadriceps muscle was simulated with loads of 0, 5, and 10 kg applied to thepatella via a system of weights and pulleys. All specimens were tested with theCCL intact and cut, both of which served as controls. The tibial tuberosity wasthen advanced using both 6 mm and 9 mm cages, and the specimen was tested usingthe identical technique. Each specimen was loaded to failure by increasing theload applied to the pes until the sudden marked cranial translation of the tibia.Tibial tuberosity advancement with an applied quadriceps load was successful inlimiting cranial tibial translation in 54/62 tests. Under similar loadingconditions, TTA failed to limit cranial translation in 8 tests. The failuresoccurred at all angles of flexion examined. In the cases that failed cranialtranslation could be limited by either increasing the quadriceps load orincreasing the amount of tibial tuberosity advancement. Conclusion: This studyshowed that TTA with an applied quadriceps load is effective at decreasingcranial tibial translation at functional joint angles.

AB  - Although several methods have been developed to improve male fertility and sperm quality, subfertility remains a primary clinical issue in male reproductionworldwide. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of the oraladministration of three commensal Lactobacillus spp. on healthy normozoospermicdogs and the qualitative parameters of their sperm. Three weeks ofsupplementation induced a significant decrease of two phyla, Proteobacteria andTenericutes, and an increase of phylum Firmicutes. At the species level, thenumber of Fusobacterium perfoetens and Anaerobiospirillum succiniciproducensdecreased, while Limosilactobacillus reuteri increased. Parallel to theseresults, qualitative sperm parameters such as total and progressive motility,acrosome integrity, and other kinematic parameters were significantly enhancedafter commensal lactobacilli supplementation. In addition, we showed thatFirmicutes were positively correlated with sperm qualitative parameters, whileProteobacteria, F. perfoetens, and A. succiniciproducens were negativelycorrelated. Considering the similarities between the gut microbiome of dogs andhumans, these results provide more insight into how gut microbiota regulationcould improve male sperm quality in both species.

LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.902151 [doi]
AB  - Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in feedlot cattle and is a major welfare and economic concern. Identification of BRD-affected cattle using clinical illness scores is problematic, and speed andcost constraints limit the feasibility of many diagnostic approaches. Dogs canrapidly identify humans and animals affected by a variety of diseases based onscent. Canines' olfactory systems can distinguish between patterns of volatileorganic compounds produced by diseased and healthy tissue. In this pilot study,two dogs ("Runnels" and "Cheaps") were trained for 7 months to discriminatebetween nasal swabs from cattle that developed signs of BRD within 20 days offeedlot arrival and swabs from cattle that did not develop BRD signs within 3months at the feedlot. Nasal swabs were collected during cattle processing uponarrival to the feedlot and were stored at -80 degrees C. Dogs were presented withsets of one positive and two negative samples and were trained using positivereinforcement to hold their noses over the positive sample. The dogs performedmoderately well in the final stage of training, with accuracy for Runnels of0.817 and Cheaps of 0.647, both greater than the 0.333 expected by chance. Duringa double-blind detection test, dogs evaluated 123 unique and unfamiliar samplesthat were presented as 41 sets (3 samples per set), with both the dog handler anddata recorder blinded to the positive sample location. Each dog was tested twice on each set of samples. Detection test accuracy was slightly better than chancefor Cheaps at 0.451 (95% CI: 0.344-0.559) and was no better than chance forRunnels at 0.390 (95% CI: 0.285-0.496. Overall accuracy was 0.421 (95% CI:0.345-0.496). When dogs' consensus response on each sample set was considered,accuracy was 0.537 (95% CI: 0.384-0.689). Detection accuracy also varied bysample lot. While dogs showed some ability to discriminate between BRD-affectedand healthy cattle using nasal swabs, the complexity of this task suggests thatmore testing is needed before determining whether dogs could be effective as ascreening method for BRD.

AB  - Exo-endoprosthesis is a limb salvage procedure for animals, although onlyexpensive metal devices have been described. Now-a-days, new materials for thistype of implant could be considered due to novel and affordable manufacturingtechniques. However, a factor of safety (FoS) should be considered. There arekinetic and kinematic studies of canine natural gaits, which can be used toestablish an FoS for mechanical tests for new non-metallic devices.Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is used in different specialties in human medicine.Its mechanical properties (and its close mechanical stiffness to that of bone)make this polymer an alternative to metals in veterinary traumatology. PEEK couldalso be used in 3D printing. The suitability of a novel inner part of anexo-endoprosthesis manufactured by fuse deposition modeling (FDM) was presentedin this study for long canine bones. Mechanical characterization of 3D-printedPEEK material and ex vivo mechanical tests of a customized endoprosthesis wereperformed to address it. Young's modulus of 3D-printed PEEK suffered a reduction of 30% in relation to bulk PEEK. Customized 3D-printed PEEK endoprostheses hadpromising outcomes for the tibiae of 20 kg dogs. Pure compression tests of thenon-inserted endoprostheses showed a maximum force of 936 +/- 199 N. In thebending tests of non-inserted endoprostheses, the PEEK part remained intact.Quasistatic mechanical tests of bone-inserted endoprostheses (compression-bendingand pure compression tests) reached a maximum force of 785 +/- 101 N and 1,642+/- 447 N, respectively. In fatigue tests, the samples reached 500,000 cycleswithout failure or detriment to their quasistatic results. These outcomes surpassthe natural weight-bearing of dogs, even during a galloping pace. In conclusion, the 3D-printed PEEK part of the endoprosthesis for an exo-endoprosthesis canwithstand loading, even during a galloping pace.

AB  - Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) is a pathological condition that directlyinterferes with the reproductive potential of senile dogs, by leading to prostateenlargement and sperm injury, which in turn may compromise sperm freezeability.Moreover, albeit finasteride treatment reduces prostatic volume and blood supply and maintains seminal quality and testicular integrity, the effects of spermsamples submitted to cryopreservation after the finasteride treatment are stillunknown. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate frozen-thawed semen of BPHdogs, as well as dogs subjected to BPH pharmacological treatment withfinasteride. For such purpose, 20 dogs were previously selected and assigned tothree experimental groups, according to BPH diagnosis and treatment withfinasteride: Control (n = 9), BPH Group (n = 5) and BPH-Finasteride Group (n =6). Semen was subjected to one-step cryopreservation protocol withtris-fructose-citric acid extender with 5% glycerol and thawed at 37 degrees Cfor 30 sec. Fresh and post-thaw sperm samples were evaluated for macroscopicparameters, sperm concentration, sperm motility kinetics, sperm mitochondrialactivity and potential, oxidative stress, plasmatic and acrosome membraneintegrity, sperm DNA fragmentation and sperm binding test on perivitelic membraneof chicken egg yolk. Regarding fresh semen, BPH-Finasteride group had the lowest ejaculate visual aspect (opacity), higher frequency of sperm flagellar beating(BCF) and percentage of sperm with medium velocity. Control group had the highestpercentage of sperm DNA integrity compared to BPH group. For the frozen-thawedsemen, Control group presented the highest percentage of spermatozoa with highmitochondrial activity. However, the BPH-Finasteride group showed higher numberof sperm bound to the perivitelline membrane of chicken egg yolk compared to the BPH Group. Conversely, BPH group had higher percentage of DNA damage. Inconclusion, the ejaculate of BPH dogs has higher susceptibility to cryoinjury,whereas finasteride-treated dogs have increased spermatozoa functionalperformance, suggesting a promising use of BPH dogs as semen donors in spermcryopreservation programs.

PG  - 768527
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.768527 [doi]
AB  - Freshwater bodies receive waste, feces, and fecal microorganisms fromagricultural, urban, and natural activities. In this study, the probable sources of fecal contamination were determined. Also, antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB)were detected in the two main rivers of central Chile. Surface water samples werecollected from 12 sampling sites in the Maipo (n = 8) and Maule Rivers (n = 4)every 3 months, from August 2017 until April 2019. To determine the fecalcontamination level, fecal coliforms were quantified using the most probablenumber (MPN) method and the source of fecal contamination was determined byMicrobial Source Tracking (MST) using the Cryptosporidium and Giardia genotyping method. Separately, to determine if antimicrobial resistance bacteria (AMB) were present in the rivers, Escherichia coli and environmental bacteria were isolated,and the antibiotic susceptibility profile was determined. Fecal coliform levelsin the Maule and Maipo Rivers ranged between 1 and 130 MPN/100-ml, and 2 and30,000 MPN/100-ml, respectively. Based on the MST results using Cryptosporidiumand Giardia host-specific species, human, cattle, birds, and/or dogs hosts werethe probable sources of fecal contamination in both rivers, with human and cattlehost-specific species being more frequently detected. Conditional tree analysisindicated that coliform levels were significantly associated with the riversystem (Maipo versus Maule), land use, and season. Fecal coliform levels weresignificantly (p < 0.006) higher at urban and agricultural sites than at sitesimmediately downstream of treatment centers, livestock areas, or natural areas.Three out of eight (37.5%) E. coli isolates presented a multidrug-resistance(MDR) phenotype. Similarly, 6.6% (117/1768) and 5.1% (44/863) of environmentalisolates, in Maipo and Maule River showed and MDR phenotype. Efforts to reducefecal discharge into these rivers should thus focus on agriculture and urban landuses as these areas were contributing the most and more frequently to fecalcontamination into the rivers, while human and cattle fecal discharges wereidentified as the most likely source of this fecal contamination by the MSTapproach. This information can be used to design better mitigation strategies,thereby reducing the burden of waterborne diseases and AMR in Central Chile.

PG  - 932224
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.932224 [doi]
AB  - Focusing on the utility of ticks as xenosurveillance sentinels to exposecirculating pathogens in Kenyan drylands, host-feeding ticks collected from wild ungulates [buffaloes, elephants, giraffes, hartebeest, impala, rhinoceros (black and white), zebras (Grevy's and plains)], carnivores (leopards, lions, spottedhyenas, wild dogs), as well as regular domestic and Boran cattle were screenedfor pathogens using metagenomics. A total of 75 host-feeding ticks [Rhipicephalus(97.3%) and Amblyomma (2.7%)] collected from 15 vertebrate taxa were sequenced in46 pools. Fifty-six pathogenic bacterial species were detected in 35 poolsanalyzed for pathogens and relative abundances of major phyla. The mostfrequently observed species was Escherichia coli (62.8%), followed by Proteusmirabilis (48.5%) and Coxiella burnetii (45.7%). Francisella tularemia andJingmen tick virus (JMTV) were detected in 14.2 and 13% of the pools,respectively, in ticks collected from wild animals and cattle. This is one of thefirst reports of JMTV in Kenya, and phylogenetic reconstruction revealedsignificant divergence from previously known isolates and related viruses. Eight fungal species with human pathogenicity were detected in 5 pools (10.8%). Thevector-borne filarial pathogens (Brugia malayi, Dirofilaria immitis, Loa loa),protozoa (Plasmodium spp., Trypanosoma cruzi), and environmental andwater-/food-borne pathogens (Entamoeba histolytica, Encephalitozoon intestinalis,Naegleria fowleri, Schistosoma spp., Toxoplasma gondii, and Trichinella spiralis)were detected. Documented viruses included human mastadenovirus C, Epstein-Barrvirus and bovine herpesvirus 5, Trinbago virus, and Guarapuava tymovirus-likevirus 1. Our findings confirmed that host-feeding ticks are an efficient sentinelfor xenosurveillance and demonstrate clear potential for wildlife-livestock-humanpathogen transfer in the Kenyan landscape.

PG  - 914477
LID - 10.3389/fcimb.2022.914477 [doi]
AB  - Canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) due to Leishmania infantum infection is azoonotic disease prevalent in the areas of South America and the Mediterranean.Infected dogs as reservoirs can contribute to disease transmission and can be ascourge to public health. Therefore, early diagnosis of infected dogs may play a pivotal role in circumscribing disease progression. Invasive tissue aspirationand insufficient serological methods impair a single assay for prompt CVLdiagnosis. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the potential of Leishmaniadonovani isolated membrane protein, LAg, for the diagnosis of CVL throughimmunological assays. Initially, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was done with Brazilian dog sera to evaluate the performance of LAg in diagnosing CVL and foundsensitivity and specificity of 92.50% and 95%, respectively. The study furtherconfirmed the diagnostic efficacy of LAg in a dipstick format. The dipstick test of canine sera from three centers in Brazil and one center in Italy collectively showed sensitivity values in the range of 53.33% to 100% in recognizingsymptomatic dogs and specificity values between 75% and 100% to rule out healthy dogs. Moreover, a rapid immunochromatographic test was developed and optimizedusing LAg. This test was able to identify 94.73% of CVL of Brazilian origin with specificity of 97.29%. The current results highlight the reactive potential ofthe L. donovani antigen, LAg, for L. infantum CVL diagnosis and support ourprevious findings, which suggest the utility of LAg for the diagnosis of both L. donovani and L. infantum human VL in a variety of endemic regions. LAg as adiagnostic candidate may be employed to identify comprehensive CVL cases inepidemiological areas.

AB  - Infants are endowed with a proclivity to acquire language, whether it ispresented in the auditory or visual modality. Moreover, in the first months oflife, listening to language supports fundamental cognitive capacities, including infants' facility to form object categories (e.g., dogs and bottles). Recently,we have found that for English-acquiring infants as young as 4 months of age,this precocious interface between language and cognition is sufficiently broad toinclude not only their native spoken language (English), but also sign language(American Sign Language, ASL). In the current study, we take this work one stepfurther, asking how "sign-naive" infants-hearing infants with no prior exposureto sign language-deploy their attentional and social strategies in the context ofepisodes involving either spoken or sign language. We adopted a now-standardcategorization task, presenting 4- to 6-month-old infants with a series ofexemplars from a single category (e.g., dinosaurs). Each exemplar was introduced by a woman who appeared on the screen together with the object. What variedacross conditions was whether this woman introduced the exemplar by speaking(English) or signing (ASL). We coded infants' visual attentional strategies andtheir spontaneous vocalizations during this task. Infants' division of attention and visual switches between the woman and exemplar varied as a function oflanguage modality. In contrast, infants' spontaneous vocalizations revealedsimilar patterns across languages. These results, which advance our understandingof how infants allocate attentional resources and engage with communicativepartners across distinct modalities, have implications for specifying ourtheories of language acquisition.

AB  - Pet food has recently been in the spotlight as an auxiliary approach to manageoral health, since it helps dogs or cats to take relatively simple care of their mouths at home. Especially, dental hygiene chew is crucial to remove teethaccumulation or plaque by chemical or mechanical methods. This study applied 3Dprinting to dental chews, which should be tailored to dogs' individual toothstructure and preferences. The optimum methods for making dental hygiene chewsbased on corn starch with glycerin for extrusion-based 3D printing weredeveloped. The viscoelasticity of dental chews increased with increasing glycerincontent. According to the infill level (40%, 60%, or 80%) and glycerin content,texture and plaque removal efficacy were investigated using a texture analyzerand dog dentures. A 60% infill level with 10% and 20% glycerin content had thebest plaque removal efficacy in both canines and premolars. A lattice structuredesign with square holes was more effective for canines, whereas a crumblytexture was more effective for premolars.

TI  - Grassland type and seasonal effects have a bigger influence on plant functionaland taxonomical diversity than prairie dog disturbances in semiarid grasslands.
PG  - e9040
LID - 10.1002/ece3.9040 [doi]
AB  - Prairie dogs (Cynomys sp.) are considered keystone species and ecosystemengineers for their grazing and burrowing activities (summarized here asdisturbances). As climate changes and its variability increases, the mechanismsunderlying organisms' interactions with their habitat will likely shift.Understanding the mediating role of prairie dog disturbance on vegetationstructure, and its interaction with environmental conditions through time, willincrease knowledge on the risks and vulnerability of grasslands.Here, we comparedhow plant taxonomical diversity, functional diversity metrics, andcommunity-weighted trait means (CWM) respond to prairie dog C. mexicanusdisturbance across grassland types and seasons (dry and wet) in a priorityconservation semiarid grassland of Northeast Mexico.Our findings suggest thatfunctional metrics and CWM analyses responded to interactions between prairie dogdisturbance, grassland type and season, whilst species diversity and covermeasures were less sensitive to the role of prairie dog disturbance. We foundweak evidence that prairie dog disturbance has a negative effect on vegetationstructure, except for minimal effects on C4 and graminoid cover, but whichdepended mainly on season. Grassland type and season explained most of theeffects on plant functional and taxonomic diversity as well as CWM traits.Furthermore, we found that leaf area as well as forb and annual cover increasedduring the wet season, independent of prairie dog disturbance.Our results provideevidence that grassland type and season have a stronger effect than prairie dogdisturbance on the vegetation of this short-grass, water-restricted grasslandecosystem. We argue that focusing solely on disturbance and grazing effects ismisleading, and attention is needed on the relationships between vegetation andenvironmental conditions which will be critical to understand semiarid grassland dynamics under future climate change conditions in the region.

AB  - Although diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA) has been recently linked to euthanasia in dogs, no prior work has examined the roles of caregiver burden or treatmentsatisfaction in this relationship. We expected that there would be an indirecteffect of caregiver burden on the association between consideration of euthanasiaand clinical signs of OA, but that this effect would be influenced by ownersatisfaction. Cross-sectional online evaluations were completed by 277 owners of dogs with OA recruited through social media. Canine OA-related pain andfunctional impairment, owner consideration of euthanasia, caregiver burden, andsatisfaction were examined. Relationships among OA-related pain and functionalimpairment, owner consideration of euthanasia, caregiver burden, and satisfactionwere statistically significant (P 0.01 for all). Cross-sectional mediationanalysis demonstrated a statistically significant indirect effect of caregiverburden on the relationship between consideration of euthanasia and OA-relatedclinical signs (bias-corrected 95% confidence interval [BC 95% CI], 0.001-0.009),which was significantly moderated by owner satisfaction (BC 95% CI, -0.003 to-0.0002). Findings align with prior work connecting canine OA to euthanasia. The current study extends past research to demonstrate that caregiver burden in theowner may be partially responsible for this relationship. The moderating role of owner satisfaction suggests that optimizing owner impressions of treatment andthe veterinary team could attenuate these relationships, potentially decreasingthe likelihood of premature euthanasia for dogs with OA.

AB  - The common intestinal protist, Blastocystis sp., is a highly frequent parasiticagent in human and animal fecal samples, globally. The current study evaluatedthe prevalence of this parasite and involved subtypes (STs) in examined pet dogs in Shiraz, southwestern Iran. A number of 100 fresh fecal specimens were randomlycollected from pet dogs referred to the veterinary clinics and pet shops inShiraz during July 2021-January 2022. The genomic DNA was extracted from fecalsamples and a conventional PCR was performed. Next, sequencing of the positivesamples was done based on the small subunit ribosomal rRNA gene. The resultsshowed that 5 % (5 out of 100) of the examined samples were positive forBlastocystis. As anticipated, three known Blastocystis subtypes with zoonoticconcern, ST1 (60 %, n = 3), ST2 (20 %, n = 1) and ST3 (20 %, n = 1), werecharacterized. Based on phylogenetic analysis, these subtypes showed 100%identity with their reference counterparts. In conclusion, the zoonotic subtypes found in pet dogs in Shiraz can pose a drastic challenge to their pet owners and other domestic animals. Albeit the role of dogs as a potential natural reservoir of Blastocystis sp. stays unknown, it appears that these animals could represent possible reservoirs of zoonotic transmission of Blastocystis sp. Still, there is paucity of data on the epidemiology of Blastocystis and its subtypes in dogs inIran.

TI  - Appendicular skeletal muscle mass assessment in dogs: a scoping literaturereview.
PG  - 280
LID - 10.1186/s12917-022-03367-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Monitoring changes in appendicular skeletal muscle mass is frequentlyused as a surrogate marker for limb function. The primary objective of this studywas to review scientific information related to the assessment of appendicularskeletal muscle mass in dogs. The secondary objective was to develop practicalrecommendations for serial evaluation of muscle mass. METHODS: A scoping reviewwas conducted with a systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science, CAB abstract,and Cochrane from inception to June 2021. The following modalities were included in the search: limb circumference, diagnostic ultrasound, computed tomography,magnetic resonance imaging, and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Atotal of 62 articles that measured appendicular skeletal muscle mass in dogs wereidentified. Limb circumference (55 articles) was the most commonly used modality.Its reliability was investigated in five studies. Several factors, includingmeasuring tape type, body position, joint angles, and the presence of hair coat, were reported as variables that can affect measurements. Diagnostic ultrasound(five articles) was validated in three articles, but there is scarce information about observer reliability and variables affecting the measurement. Computedtomography (four articles) and magnetic resonance imaging (one article) have beenused to validate other modalities at a single time point rather than as aclinical tool for serial muscle mass monitoring. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry(two articles) has been used to quantify specific skeletal muscle mass but wasmainly used to evaluate body composition in dogs. CONCLUSION: Limb circumference and ultrasound are likely the main modalities that will continue to be used forserial muscle mass measurement in the clinical setting unless a new technology isdeveloped. The reliability of limb circumference is questionable. Several keyfactors, including measuring tape type, body position, joint angles, and coatclipping, need to be controlled to improve the reliability of limb circumference measurements. Ultrasound may provide a reasonable alternative, but furtherstudies are required to evaluate the reliability of this modality and identifyfactors that influence ultrasound measurements.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of unassisted spontaneous breathing (SB) andcomplete muscle paralysis (PC) on early severe acute respiratory distresssyndrome (ARDS) in an animal model, and to explore the possibility of biphasicpositive airway pressure (BIPAP) as lung protective ventilation support forpatients in the early stage of severe ARDS. METHODS: Twelve healthy beagle dogsbetween the ages of 10 and 15 months were randomly divided into two groups: theSB group (BIPAPSB) and the PC group (BIPAPPC). Arterial blood samples were drawn before modelling. Arterial blood gas analysis and mechanical tests wereconducted. The animal model of severe ARDS was established using a deepintravenous injection of oleic acid, and BIPAP ventilation was performed for 8hours. Lung tissue and blood were taken to detect lung function, inflammatoryreactions and degree of pathological damage. RESULTS: At the beginning of theexperiment, there was no significant difference in the arterial blood gasanalysis between the two groups (p > 0.05). After successful modelling, theoxygenation index and the end-expiratory lung volume in the SB group weresignificantly higher than those in the PC group 8 hours after MV. Pathologically,the wet-dry ratio and pathological score of the PC group were higher than thoseof the SB group; the lung injury in the gravity-dependent area in the SB groupwas less than that in the PC group (p< 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In the early stage of severe ARDS induced by oleic acid, compared with PC, retention of the BIPAP mode of SB can reduce the risk of lung injury and improve respiratory function.

AB  - Force plates are considered the gold standard for kinetic gait analysis,benefiting from measuring three-dimensional ground reaction forces. Nevertheless,the major disadvantage is that many trials are required during overgroundlocomotion to capture adequate single-limb contacts. Additionally, the dogsslightly change velocities during overground walking, influencing kinetic andkinematic gait parameters. An alternative is using an instrumented treadmill thatbenefits from capturing many steady-state gait cycles at a constant speedquickly. The goal of this study was (1) to compare overground with treadmilllocomotion and (2) to compare the instrumented treadmill with force plates fordogs kinetics measurements. Twelve client-owned dogs were measured duringtreadmill trotting while the treadmill was placed on force plates. Additionally, the dogs were measured during trotting along an alley over eight force plates.Bland-Altman plots, Pearson's (r), and concordance correlation coefficients (rc) were computed to explore the relative and general agreement between themeasurement methods and overground and treadmill trotting. Overground andtreadmill trotting gave an excellent agreement in peak vertical forces andimpulses (r > 0.9, rc > 0.9). The instrumented treadmill showed similarforce-time curves in shape and size and provided an excellent congruity for allparameters compared to force plates (r > 0.8, rc > 0.8). As a reliable tool inmeasuring key gait parameters, the instrumented treadmill may benefit from fastand reproducible data comparable to overground trotting.

AB  - Mammary tumors are the most frequent neoplasia in old female dogs and presentchallenges in diagnosis and prognosis owing to heterogeneity. Along with therapid development of biotechnology, the molecular subtyping of canine mammarycarcinomas has been researched, and provides an important reference basis fordiagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and even prediction of recurrence rate.Therefore, the molecular classification of canine mammary carcinomas has gained abroad clinical application prospect. However, the existing molecular markers ofcanine mammary carcinomas are still unable to meet the expanding clinical needswith poor clinical feasibility. Thus, it is urgent to develop more applicablebiomarkers appropriate for personalized treatment modalities. At present, themolecular typing of canine mammary carcinomas is not fully understood, and it is first reviewed in this study.

TI  - Environmental exposures and lymphoma risk: a nested case-control study using the Golden Retriever Lifetime Study cohort.
PG  - 10
LID - 10.1186/s40575-022-00122-9 [doi]
AB  - Lymphoma is the second most common cancer affecting Golden Retrievers and ishypothesized to arise through a complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors. The aim of this nested case-control study was to investigate theassociation between potential environmental pollutant sources and lymphoma riskamong Golden Retrievers participating in the Golden Retriever Lifetime Study.Forty-nine Golden Retrievers with non-cutaneous lymphoma and 98 Golden Retrieverswithout a history of cancer matched by age, sex and neuter status were selectedfrom the Golden Retriever Lifetime Study cohort. Geographic proximity betweeneach dog's primary residence and nine potential sources of environmentalpollution was determined. In addition, the average annual ozone and airborne fineparticulate matter levels for each dog's county of residence and owner-reportedsecondhand smoke exposure were evaluated. Environmental pollution sources ofinterest included chemical plants, municipal dumps, manufacturing plants,incineration plants, railroad embankment tracks, landfills, coal plants,high-voltage transmission lines, and nuclear power plants. Conditional logisticregression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals(CIs) for each exposure of interest. Subgroup analyses were conducted to evaluatewhether associations differed among 1) dogs with multicentric lymphoma, 2) dogswith B-cell lymphoma, and 3) dogs with T-cell lymphoma. No variables reachedstatistical significance when evaluating all cases together. However, cumulative exposure burden (household proximity to 3 or more pollution sources) approachedsignificance within the multicentric lymphoma subgroup (OR = 2.60, 95%CI0.99-6.86, p-value = 0.053). Patterns emerged among B- and T-cell subgroups, but none reached statistical significance. Ongoing research is warranted to discernif different environmental mechanisms may be driving B- and T-cell lymphomaimmunophenotypes, consistent with previously reported regional differences insubtype prevalence.

OAB - Lymphoma is a common cancer affecting dogs, particularly Golden Retrievers. Byidentifying risk factors for lymphoma, work can be done to reduce harmfulexposures or increase monitoring among dogs at a higher risk of disease. Using a subset of dogs from the Golden Retriever Lifetime Study, we sought to investigatewhether dogs with lymphoma were more likely to live near certain environmentalpollutant sources than dogs without lymphoma.Forty-nine Golden Retrievers withnon-cutaneous lymphoma and 98 Golden Retrievers without a history of cancer were selected from the Golden Retriever Lifetime Study Cohort. We evaluated how close each dog lived to nine environmental pollutant sources: chemical plants,municipal dumps, manufacturing plants, incineration plants, railroad embankmenttracks, landfills, coal plants, high-voltage transmission lines, and nuclearpower plants. Additionally, we evaluated individual exposure to secondhand smoke,and average annual ozone and particulate matter exposure (as surrogate measuresfor air pollution) for each dog's county of residence.None of the exposuresexamined were associated with an increased lymphoma risk in this population. Moreresearch is needed, including direct biomonitoring, to determine whether specificenvironmental exposures are associated with lymphoma in the Golden Retrieverbreed.

PG  - 621
LID - 10.1186/s12879-022-07580-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus canis is a group G beta-hemolytic Streptococcus specieswhich normally resides on the skin and mucosal surfaces of dogs. Although itrarely causes infection in humans, our case and review of relevant literaturedemonstrate that this multi-host pathogen may be responsible for metastaticinfection. We present an appropriate management strategy in such cases. CASEPRESENTATION: A previously healthy 26-year-old male presented to the emergencydepartment with a 2-day history of erythema, pain, and swelling of the left ankleand foot, consistent with acute cellulitis. The patient was initially discharged home with a plan to complete a course of IV cefazolin as an outpatient, but laterrecalled after two sets of blood cultures grew gram positive cocci. Bloodcultures speciated as Streptococcus canis. This was performed by identifying betahemolytic strep on blood agar, then typed as Lancefield group G, followed byMALDI-TOF which distinguished S. canis. History was unremarkable except for a2-week history of lower back pain precipitated by a wrestling injury. There wasno canine bite or scratch wound, although the patient lives with a dog. CT spine was obtained which demonstrated right piriformis myositis and S1 osteomyelitis.MRI additionally demonstrated right erector spinae myositis, right sacroiliitis, and multiple collections in the right posterior paraspinal soft tissues.Transthoracic echocardiogram did not demonstrate valvular vegetations. The S.canis isolate was pan-susceptible and the patient was ultimately discharged home and completed a 8-week course of IV penicillin G. After completion of therapy,his symptoms, repeat imaging, and biochemical markers suggested resolution ofinfection on follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that management of S. canisbacteremia should involve consideration of screening for metastatic infection andinfectious diseases consultation. However, despite its potential for systemicinvolvement, S. canis is often susceptible to narrow spectrum antibiotics, andmay be treated with penicillins.

AB  - Humans' individual differences including their demographics, personality,attitudes and experiences are often associated with important outcomes for theanimals they interact with. This is pertinent to companion animals such as catsand dogs, given their social and emotional importance to humans and degree ofintegration into human society. However, the mechanistic underpinnings and causalrelationships that characterise links between human individual differences andcompanion animal behaviour and wellbeing are not well understood. In thisexploratory investigation, we firstly quantified the underlying structure of, andvariation in, human's styles of behaviour during typical human-cat interactions(HCI), focusing on aspects of handling and interaction known to be preferred bycats (i.e. 'best practice'), and their variation. We then explored the potential significance of various human individual differences as predictors of these HCIstyles. Seven separate HCI styles were identified via Principal ComponentAnalysis (PCA) from averaged observations for 119 participants, interacting with sociable domestic cats within a rehoming context. Using General Linear Models(GLMs) and an Information Theoretic (IT) approach, we found these HCI PCcomponents were weakly to strongly predicted by factors including cat-ownershiphistory, participant personality (measured via the Big Five Inventory, or BFI),age, work experience with animals and participants' subjective ratings of theircat behaviour knowledge. Paradoxically, greater cat ownership experiences andself-assessed cat knowledge were not positively associated with 'best practice'styles of HCI, but were instead generally predictive of HCI styles known to beless preferred by cats, as was greater participant age and Neuroticism. Thesefindings have important implications regarding the quality of human-companionanimal relationships and dyadic compatibility, in addition to the role ofeducational interventions and their targeting for optimal efficacy. In thecontext of animal adoption, these results strengthen the (limited) evidence base for decision making associated with cat-adopter screening and matching. Inparticular, our results suggest that greater cat ownership experiences andself-reports of cat knowledge might not necessarily convey advantages for cats inthe context of HCI.

TI  - Prescribing habits for the use of omeprazole as a gastroprotectant in dogs in aveterinary teaching hospital.
LID - 10.1111/jsap.13531 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the prescribing habits for omeprazole in a veterinaryteaching hospital and to evaluate the effect of a clinical audit on omeprazoleprescription. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Observational study with retrospectiveclinical audit followed by a prospective study. The evaluated data aboutomeprazole prescription included the dose, frequency and indication. These wereassessed according to published guidelines. A seminar about the audit and currentguidelines on the use of omeprazole was organised for all members of clinicalstaff. Prospective data collection was conducted after the seminar. A comparison of the collected data before and after the clinical audit was made. RESULTS: Atotal of 301 dogs were prescribed omeprazole in the veterinary teaching hospital during the study period (including the retrospective and prospective parts).Complete data were acquired from 240 patients. The prescribed frequency ofomeprazole was inappropriate in 23 (16.5%) of the prescriptions in theretrospective section but in only five (5.0%) in the prospective study.Inappropriate indications were reported in 12 (8.6%) patients in theretrospective section and in two patients (2.0%) in the prospective study.Overall inappropriate omeprazole prescription was identified in 34 (24.5%)patients in the retrospective part and in seven (6.9%) patients in theprospective part. There was a statistically significant difference between thetwo groups in frequency, indication and overall prescription of omeprazole.CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This study details the frequency of inappropriateprescription of omeprazole in a veterinary teaching hospital and provides someevidence that dissemination of guidelines based on clinical audit can improveprescribing habits.

TI  - High-level seroprevalence against Leptospira interrogans serovars among wildfoxes, jackals and stray dogs in the North Khorasan Province, Iran.
LID - 10.1002/vms3.890 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is an important, neglected zoonotic disease thataffects people and animals in humid (sub)tropical regions. Wild canines carry thepathogen and may contaminate natural resources which may then act as a source of human infection. OBJECTIVES: The study was designed to understand theseroprevalence of leptospirosis among domestic and wild canines in BojnurdCounty, Northeast Iran. METHODS: A total of 77 serum samples, comprising 29 sera from asymptomatic wild canines [foxes (n = 25) and jackals (n = 4)] and 48 serafrom asymptomatic stray dogs, was investigated. Serovars were identified andantibody titres were measured by standard microscopic agglutination test (MAT)using serial serum dilutions. RESULTS: Among all serum samples, 44.1% reactedpositively to a Leptospira interrogans serovars. The average percentage ofpositive reactions was higher in stray dogs than in wild canines although thisdid not reach statistical significance (55.2% and 37.5%, p = 0.159). Positivereactions with L. i. Pomona, L. i. Australis and L. i. Tarasovi was detected onlyamong jackals and foxes. Among the stray dogs, the highest number of positivesera were for L. i. Grippotyphosa (61.1%) and L. i. Canicola (50%). The highesttitre detected was for L. i. canicola (1:1600) in two stray dogs and against L.i. Icterohaemorrhagiae and L. i. Pomona (1:800) in a single jackal. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed that leptospirosis is endemic among various canine species in the North Khorasan Province of Iran. Detailed monitoring of canines is necessary for better understanding the epidemiology of infection in our and other Iranianregions.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the effect of 15 min of exercise 30 min post-meal on mean blood glucose concentrations in 5 well-conditioned versus 5 over-conditioneddogs. To compare the effect of exercise on glycemic control in dogs eating their maintenance diet as compared to a high carbohydrate meal. ANIMALS: Ten healthystaff or student owned dogs, five well- and five over-conditioned. PROCEDURES:This was a crossover study over 5 days. Continuous glucose monitors (CGM) wereplaced on day 1. On days 2 and 3, dogs received their maintenance diet and a highcarbohydrate meal, respectively and were walked on the treadmill for 15 minfollowing each meal. On day 4, dogs were given their maintenance diet in hospitalwithout treadmill activity. On day 5, the CGM were removed. The mean bloodglucose 30 min post-meal, during exercise, 15 min after completing exercise, and the 1-3 h period after completing the exercise were compared to detect any effectof exercise, diet composition, or body condition. RESULTS: Dogs consuming a high carbohydrate meal had a significantly higher mean blood glucose 15 minpost-exercise. Mean glucose values at all time points following a highcarbohydrate meal were significantly higher than mean glucose values on thenon-exercise day. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: No impact of post-prandial exercise on glucose concentrations were identified in this study, however, thecarbohydrate content of the meal impacted post-prandial glycemic responses inhealthy dogs regardless of body condition. Evaluating the impact of post-prandialexercise in insulin-dependent or glucose-intolerant dogs is warranted todetermine if these findings persist.

AB  - Ovarian cancer has a high mortality rate due to its unclear symptomology and the lack of precise early detection tools. If detected in the first stage, over 90%of patients reach remission. As such, developing a reliable method of earlydetection is crucial in reducing the mortality rate of the disease. One potentialmethod would be to identify specific biomarkers that are unique to ovariancancer, which could be detected using a blood test. While this can be done using gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS), identifying these biomarkers isan enormous task. One way to expedite the process is to utilize trained scentdetection canines. In this study, dogs who were previously trained to respond to positive blood samples from ovarian cancer patients were then tested on theirability to recognize samples prepared by micro-preparative gas chromatography(MP-GC) techniques. MP-GC employed a gradient-cooled glass tube connected to the GC outlet to collect GC eluents containing the plasma-derived volatiles inpositive blood samples. These post-column fractions were collected at the exit ofthe GC according to their eluent times (i.e., 0-15 min, 15-25 min and 25-35 minor 0-35 min) and these full or fractional collections were presented to thetrained dogs to judge their responses. Dogs' time spent investigating the odorwas used as an indication of odor recognition and was significantly longer on theearly (0-15 min) and middle (15-25 min) fractions of the ovarian cancer than the late (25-35 min) fraction of plasma odorants or either the negative fractions or distractors odorants. These findings suggest that characteristic odor biomarkers of ovarian cancer for dogs may exist in the relatively small and more volatilecompounds. Additionally, variation between dogs suggests that there may be anumber of different biomarkers that can be used to identify ovarian cancer.

LID - 10.1111/tbed.14660 [doi]
AB  - Leishmaniasis (or the leishmaniases), classified as a neglected tropicalparasitic disease, is found in parts of the tropics, subtropics and southernEurope. Leishmania parasites are transmitted by the bite of phlebotomine sandflies and million cases of human infection occur annually. Leishmania tarentolae has been historically considered a non-pathogenic protozoan of reptiles, whichhas been studied mainly for its potential biotechnological applications. However,some strains of L. tarentolae appear to be transiently infective to mammals. Inareas where leishmaniasis is endemic, recent molecular diagnostics andserological positivity to L. tarentolae in humans and dogs have spurred interest in the interactions between these mammalian hosts, reptiles and Leishmaniainfantum, the main aetiologic agent of human and canine leishmaniasis. In thisreview, we discuss the systematics and biology of L. tarentolae in the insectvectors and the vertebrate hosts and address questions about evolution ofreptilian leishmaniae. Furthermore, we discuss the possible usefulness of L.tarentolae for new vaccination strategies.

TI  - Right auricle aneurysm in dogs can be detected with multidetector-row CT andpresents with varying morphology.
LID - 10.1111/vru.13130 [doi]
AB  - Right auricle aneurysm (RAA) has been reported to be a rare congenital oracquired condition in dogs, however published CT characteristics are limited to asmall number of cases. The aim of this 13-year, single-center, retrospective,cross-sectional study was to describe the prevalence and appearance of RAA in alarger group of dogs. Reports of 10,886 dogs that underwent thoracic CTexamination for various reasons were reviewed. Computed tomographic data of dogs with presumed RAA (based on published imaging characteristics) were retrievedfrom the archive. Oblique multiplanar reformatted images were used to record RAA site, shape, and dimensions (neck, maximum height and width). Patients' sex, age,and body weight were evaluated for any association with the presence of RAA.Presumed RAA was detected in 23/10,886 dogs having thoracic CT in the selectedperiod of time (prevalence 0.21%). Three RAA phenotypes were described: diffusesaccular dilation in 19 of 23 dogs, focal saccular dilation in three of 23 dogs, and fusiform in one of 23 dogs. The bodyweights of dogs with presumed RAA weresignificantly lower than those of the remaining 10836 dogs without RAA (median 8 kg [IQR 5; range 37.6] and median 16 kg [IQR 23; range 116.9] respectively; P <0.003. Female sex was also significantly associated with RAA (P = 0.03). Findingsindicated that RAA has a low prevalence in dogs, can be detected with CT, can be present in asymptomatic dogs, and can have varying appearances. In this sample ofdogs, female sex and low body weight were significantly associated with RAA.

TI  - Comparison of approaches for source attribution of ESBL-producing Escherichiacoli in Germany.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0271317 [doi]
AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia (E.) coli have beenwidely described as the cause of treatment failures in humans around the world.The origin of human infections with these microorganisms is discussedcontroversially and in most cases hard to identify. Since they pose a relevantrisk to human health, it becomes crucial to understand their sources and thetransmission pathways. In this study, we analyzed data from different studies in Germany and grouped ESBL-producing E. coli from different sources and human casesinto subtypes based on their phenotypic and genotypic characteristics(ESBL-genotype, E. coli phylogenetic group and phenotypic antimicrobialresistance pattern). Then, a source attribution model was developed in order toattribute the human cases to the considered sources. The sources were fromdifferent animal species (cattle, pig, chicken, dog and horse) and also frompatients with nosocomial infections. The human isolates were gathered fromcommunity cases which showed to be colonized with ESBL-producing E. coli. We usedthe attribution model first with only the animal sources (Approach A) and thenadditionally with the nosocomial infections (Approach B). We observed that allsources contributed to the human cases, nevertheless, isolates from nosocomialinfections were more related to those from human cases than any of the othersources. We identified subtypes that were only detected in the considered animal species and others that were observed only in the human population. Some subtypesfrom the human cases could not be allocated to any of the sources from this studyand were attributed to an unknown source. Our study emphasizes the importance of human-to-human transmission of ESBL-producing E. coli and the different role thatpets, livestock and healthcare facilities may play in the transmission of theseresistant bacteria. The developed source attribution model can be further used tomonitor future trends. A One Health approach is necessary to develop sourceattribution models further to integrate also wildlife, environmental as well asfood sources in addition to human and animal data.

TI  - Left atrial remodeling in mitral regurgitation: A combinedexperimental-computational study.
PG  - e0271588
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0271588 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Progressive changes to left atrial (LA) structure and function followingmitral regurgitation (MR) remain incompletely understood. This study aimed todemonstrate potential underlying mechanisms using experimental canine models and computer simulations. METHODS: A canine model of MR was created by cauterization of mitral chordae followed by radiofrequency ablation-induced left bundle-branch block (LBBB) after 4 weeks (MR-LBBB group). Animals with LBBB alone served ascontrol. Echocardiography was performed at baseline, acutely after MR induction, and at 4 and 20 weeks, and correlated with histology and computer simulations.RESULTS: Acute MR augmented LA reservoir and contractile strain (40+/-4 to53+/-6% and -11+/-5 to -22+/-9% respectively, p<0.05). LA fractional area change increased significantly (47+/-4 to 56+/-4%, p<0.05) while LA end-systolic arearemained unchanged (7.2+/-1.1 versus 7.9+/-1.1 cm2 respectively, p = 0.08). LAstrain 'pseudonormalized' after 4 weeks and decompensated at 20 weeks with bothstrains decreasing to 25+/-6% and -3+/-2% respectively (p<0.05) together with aprogressive increase in LA end-systolic area (7.2+/-1.1 to 14.0+/-6.3 cm2,p<0.05). In the LBBB-group, LA remodeling was less pronounced. Histology showed atrend towards increased interstitial fibrosis in the LA of the MR-LBBB group.Computer simulations indicated that the progressive changes in LA structure andfunction are a combination of progressive eccentric remodeling and fibrosis.CONCLUSION: MR augmented LA strain acutely to supranormal values withoutsignificant LA dilation. However, over time, LA strain gradually decreases(pseudornormal and decompensated) with LA dilation. Histology and computersimulations indicated a correlation to a varying degree of LA eccentricremodeling and fibrosis.

TI  - Regeneration of critical-sized grade II furcation using a novel injectablemelatonin-loaded scaffold.
LID - 10.1111/odi.14314 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Periodontal regenerative therapy using bone-substituting materialshas gained favorable clinical significance in enhancing osseous regeneration.These materials should be biocompatible, osteogenic, malleable, andbiodegradable. This study assessed the periodontal regenerative capacity of anovel biodegradable bioactive hydrogel template of organic-inorganic compositeloaded with melatonin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A melatonin-loadedalginate-chitosan/beta-tricalcium phosphate composite hydrogel was successfullyprepared and characterized. Thirty-six critical-sized bilateral class IIfurcation defects were created in six Mongrel dogs, and were randomly divided andallocated to three cohorts; sham, unloaded composite, and melatonin-loaded.Periodontal regenerative capacity was evaluated via histologic andhistomorphometric analysis. RESULTS: Melatonin-treated group showed acceleratedbone formation and advanced maturity, with a significant twofold increase innewly formed inter-radicular bone compared with the unloaded composite. Theshort-term regenerative efficacy was evident 4 weeks postoperatively as asignificant increase in cementum length concurrent with reduction of entrappedepithelium. After 8 weeks, the scaffold produced a quality of newly synthesizedbone similar to normal compact bone, with potent periodontal ligament attachment.CONCLUSIONS: Melatonin-loaded hydrogel template accelerated formation andenhanced quality of newly formed bone, allowing complete periodontalregeneration. Furthermore, the scaffold prevented overgrowth and entrapment ofepithelial cells in furcation defects.

LID - 10.1111/vec.13219 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate agreement between 2 standard laboratory (SL) methods andan immunochromatographic strip (ICS) method to crossmatch dogs receiving RBCtransfusions. A second objective was to evaluate uninterpretable SL crossmatchresults as compared to ICS in the presence of autoagglutination. DESIGN:Prospective observational study (September 2018 to October 2019). SETTING:University teaching hospital. ANIMALS: Forty anemic dogs receiving RBCtransfusions. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: All dogsreceived DEA 1-negative packed RBCs. Three crossmatch methods were evaluatedagainst the same unit transfused to each dog: SL method performed atinstitutional laboratory (SL-I), SL method sent to a commercial laboratory(SL-C), and a commercially available point-of-care ICS method. Major and minorcrossmatches were incompatible for 2.5%/7.5% of ICS tests, 82.5%/52.5% of SL-Itests, and 52.5%/27.5% of SL-C tests. Agreement between ICS and SL-C major (kappa= 0.05) and minor (kappa = 0.02) crossmatches and between ICS and SL-I major(kappa = 0.009) and minor (kappa = 0.03) crossmatches was slight. Agreementbetween SL-C and SL-I major (kappa = -0.06) and minor (kappa = -0.12)crossmatches was poor. Results of major and minor crossmatches wereuninterpretable due to autoagglutination in 38%/38% for SL-I and 29%/18% for SL-Ccrossmatches. ICS method was interpretable for 93% (major) and 98% (minor)crossmatches. After exclusion of uninterpretable SL pairings, agreement stillremained poor to slight between all tests. Only 1 of 40 dogs (2.5%; 95%confidence interval: <1.0%-13.2%) had an immediate immunological transfusionreaction. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of agreement between all methodologies was noted. Thehigh level of incompatibility predicted by SL methods despite lack of clinically relevant reactions suggests a high false incompatibility rate as compared to the ICS test. ICS testing was also able to give results more frequently in the faceof autoagglutination. Further work is needed to investigate the ICS method'sability to predict clinically significant transfusion reactions.

TI  - Total corpora mobilization for penile reconstruction.
PG  - 878-879
LID - 10.1590/S1677-5538.IBJU.2022.0177 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Total corpora mobilization (TCM) is a novel technique that is used forpenile reconstruction in cases of micropenis and penile amputation. Its principleis based on Kelly's procedure for bladder exstrophy (1). In contrast to the Kellyprocedure, TCM is performed entirely through the perineum with the patient in thelithotomy position. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TCM was performed on three patients.The first was a boy who suffered trauma from a dog bite at an age of eightmonths. At 23 years old he underwent TCM. The second patient had genitalself-amputation induced by psychiatric disorder. After treatment, at 27 yearsold, he desired surgery for penile reconstruction. The third patient had partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) with a micropenis and at 23 years old had TCM procedure. The patients were placed in the lithotomy position with a perinealincision in the midline. A subperiosteal incision was made and the corporacavernosa were detached from the pubic arch and the ischial rami. The periosteum and the neurovascular bundles were preserved. Subsequently the corpora cavernosa was mobilized upward and the periosteum that was left attached to them wassutured to the pubis. RESULTS: At twenty-four, nine, and six months,respectively, in the follow-up process, all patients expressed satisfaction with the final cosmetic appearance, penile length, and erectile function. CONCLUSION: TCM may prove to be an alternative for patients with a functional disturbancebecause of small penile length, though a higher number of cases and a moreextended follow-up are needed to draw a more definitive conclusion.

TI  - Expression of adipokines and adipocytokines by epidural adipose tissue in caudaequina syndrome in dogs.
PG  - 1373-1381
LID - 10.1111/jvim.16483 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Compression of epidural adipose tissue (EAT) within the scope ofcauda equina syndrome (CES) could lead to an enhanced expression of inflammatory mediators, possibly contributing to pain amplification in dogs. OBJECTIVES: Toanalyze expression of inflammatory adipo(-cyto)kines within the EAT of dogs with CES. ANIMALS: Client-owned dogs: 15 dogs with CES and 9 dogs euthanized forunrelated medical reasons (controls). METHODS: Prospective, experimental study.Epidural adipose tissue and subcutaneous adipose tissue were collected duringdorsal laminectomy and used for real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.Tissue explants were cultured for measurements of inflammation-induced release ofcytokines. RESULTS: Results show a CES-associated upregulation of the cytokinestumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha: mean +/- SD: 18.88 +/- 11.87, 95% CI:10.90-26.86 vs 9.66 +/- 5.22, 95% CI: 5.29-14.02, *: P = .04) and interleukin-(IL-) 10 (20.1 +/- 9.15, 95% CI: 14.82-25.39 vs 11.52 +/- 6.82, 95% CI:5.82-17.22, *: P = .03), whereas the expression of the adipokine leptin wasattenuated in EAT of dogs with CES (3.07 +/- 2.29, 95% CI: 1.80-3.34 vs 9.83 +/- 8.42, 95% CI: 3.36-16.30, **: P = .007). Inflammatory stimulation of EAT explant cultures resulted in an enhanced release of IL-6 (LPS: 5491.55 +/- 4438, 95% CI: 833.7-10 149; HMGB1: 1001.78 +/- 522.2, 95% CI: 518.8-1485; PBS: 310.9 +/- 98.57,95% CI: 228.5-393.3, ***: P < .001). CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE:Expression profile of inflammatory adipo(-cyto)kines by EAT is influenced fromcompressive forces acting in dogs with CES and might contribute to amplification of pain.

TI  - Dog and Cat Contact as Risk Factor for Human Toxocariasis: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 854468
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2022.854468 [doi]
AB  - Toxocariasis, a neglected parasitic zoonosis with worldwide distribution, hasbeen reportedly associated to different risk factors in several epidemiologicaland meta-analysis studies. However, dog and cat contact (environmental and animalexposure) as isolated associated risk factor for children and adults remains tobe fully established. Accordingly, the present meta-analysis has aimed todirectly assess dog and cat contact for toxocariasis seropositivity in under-18and adult persons, using a survey strategy of PubMed/Medline, Embase, Scopus and Scielo Databases, from January 2009 to December 2021. A meta-analysis model ofrandom effects was applied to estimate odds ratio (OR) with 95% ConfidenceInterval (CI). The statistical heterogeneity was evaluated by the Cochran Q-Test and I (2) values. A total of 41 transversal studies (n = 20.515 individuals) fromdifferent geographic regions (classified by the World Health Organization) wereincluded herein. In overall, 1,882/13,496 (13.95%; 95% IC = 13.4-14.5) youngersand 513/7.019 (7.3%; 95% CI = 6.7-7.9) adults in contact with dogs or cats wereserologically reagent for anti-Toxocara antibodies. Association of dog and catcontact was observed only in youngers, with both dogs (OR = 1.53; p < 0.0001) andcats (OR = 1.64; p = 0.0001). In addition, association of dog and contact andserology was statistically significant in populations of Americas (OR = 1.37; 95%CI = 1.1-1.7), Middle East (OR = 2.9; 95% CI = 1.6-5.1) and West Pacific (OR =1.6; 95% IC = 1.3-1.9). In conclusion, contact with dogs and cats, particularlyby younger individuals and in regions such as Americas, Middle East, and WestPacific, should be always a public health concern for toxocariasis. Moreover,dogs and cats should be periodically dewormed, washed and hair cleaned prior tocontact with youngers. Finally, robust statistical results herein may serve asbasis for future strategies and preventive measures for safer dog and catcontact.

AB  - As a new generation of medical metal materials, degradable magnesium-basedmaterials have excellent mechanical properties and osteogenic promoting ability, making them promising materials for the treatment of refractory bone diseases.Animal models can be used to understand and evaluate the performance of materialsin complex physiological environments, providing relevant data for preclinicalevaluation of implants and laying the foundation for subsequent clinical studies.To date, many researchers have studied the biocompatibility, degradability andosteogenesis of magnesium-based materials, but there is a lack of reviewregarding the effects of magnesium-based materials in vivo. In view of thegrowing interest in these materials, this review briefly describes the propertiesof magnesium-based materials and focuses on the safety and efficacy ofmagnesium-based materials in vivo. Various animal models including rats, rabbits,dogs and pigs are covered to better understand and evaluate the progress andfuture of magnesium-based materials. This literature analysis reveals that themagnesium-based materials have good biocompatibility and osteogenic activity,thus causing no adverse reaction around the implants in vivo, and that theyexhibit a beneficial effect in the process of bone repair. In addition, thedegradation rate in vivo can also be improved by means of alloying and coating.These encouraging results show a promising future for the use of magnesium-based materials in musculoskeletal disorders.

TI  - Understanding the dog population in the Republic of Ireland: insight fromexisting data sources?
PG  - 16
LID - 10.1186/s13620-022-00223-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reliable information about national pet dog populations is animportant contributor to informed decision-making, both by governments andnational dog welfare organisations. In some countries, there is an improvedunderstanding of aspects of the national pet dog population, but as yet limitedpublished information is available in Ireland. The current study reviews theutility of existing data to inform our understanding of recent changes to the petdog population in Ireland, including both biological and organisationalprocesses. RESULTS: Based on national data on dog licencing and microchippingregistration, pet dog numbers have remained relatively stable in recent years (ieprior to the COVID-19 pandemic). Since 2015, there has been a substantialdecrease in the number of dogs managed through dog control centres. Although the completeness of the data are likely variable, there appears to be substantial,and increasing, number of dogs moving from Ireland to other countries, including UK, Sweden, Italy, Germany and Singapore. We also note an increase (albeit muchsmaller) in the number of dogs being moved into Ireland. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the challenges faced when using existing national data to gaininsights into the dog population of Ireland. The linking of existing nationaldatabases (individual dog identification, dog licencing, dog control statistics) has the potential to improve both the representativeness and accuracy ofinformation about the Irish pet dog population. In the next phases of our work,we will focus on the work of dog welfare organisations, given both the increased role played by these organisations and the substantial public funding that hasbeen committed in this sector.

TI  - Prevalence of bacteriuria in cats with neurogenic bladder.
LID - 10.1007/s11259-022-09973-w [doi]
AB  - Urinary tract infections are defined as the adherence, multiplication, andpersistence of an infectious agent within the urogenital system, causing anassociated inflammatory response and clinical signs; instead, the presence ofbacteria in urine as determined by positive bacterial culture (PUC) from aproperly collected urine specimen, in the absence of clinical signs, is definedsubclinical bacteriuria. Limited information on the prevalence of PUC in spinalcord injury cats affected by neurogenic bladder (NB) is available. On contrary,in NB dogs and humans the prevalence of bacteriuria is well documented. Moreover,while in humans information about bacteriemia associated with NB is alreadyavailable, this aspect has never been studied in NB cats. The aim of thisprospective study was to determine the prevalence of PUC in cats with NB,compared to animals affected by chronic kidney disease (CKD) and healthy cats.Furthermore, the prevalence of bacteriemia in cats with NB was evaluated.Fifty-one cats met the inclusion criteria: 12 cats were affected by NB, 22 hadCKD and 17 were healthy. The prevalence of PUC was 58.33% and 18% in NB and CKDcat populations, respectively. All blood cultures were negative. The incompletebladder emptying and the decreased resistance in the bladder wall could beconsidered predisposing elements to PUC in the NB feline population. The results of this study highlight, for the first time, an high prevalence of PUC in catsaffected by NB, which was not found to be associated with bacteriemia.

AB  - Temporal and spatio-temporal niche partitioning is an important strategy forcarnivore coexistence. Camera-trap data has been analyzed through several methodsto assess the temporal and spatio-temporal niche partitioning. However, differentanalytical approaches used to may evaluate niche partitioning detect differentresults. In this study, we evaluated the temporal or spatio-temporal partitioningamong sympatric medium-sized carnivores, red foxes, raccoon dogs, and Japanesemartens, based on three analytical methods-the temporal overlap, temporalco-occurrence, and time-to-encounter analysis-to evaluate. From May to October2019 and 2020, we obtained the activity of the target species using camera-traps in northeastern Japan. We analyzed the data with the coefficient of temporaloverlap, probabilistic co-occurrence analysis, checkerboard score, andmulti-response permutation procedures. The results of the assessment of the nichepartitioning differed depending on the analytical methods based on temporal andspatio-temporal partitioning. Therefore, we conclude that the choice ofanalytical approach is important for evaluating the temporal and spatio-temporal niche partitioning.

AB  - Lymphoma is one of the most prevalent hematological cancers, accounting for 15-20% of new cancer diagnoses in dogs. Therefore, this study aims to explore theimportant genes and pathways involved in canine lymphoma progression andunderstand the underlying molecular mechanisms using RNA sequencing. In thisstudy, RNAs acquired from seven pairs of lymphoma and non-lymphoma blood samples were sequenced from different breeds of dogs. Sequencing reads were preprocessed,aligned with the reference genome, assembled and expressions were estimatedthrough bioinformatics approaches. At a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 andfold change (FC) >/= 1.5, a total of 625 differentially expressed genes (DEGs)were identified between lymphoma and non-lymphoma samples, including 347up-regulated DEGs such as SLC38A11, SCN3A, ZIC5 etc. and 278 down-regulated DEGs such as LOC475937, CSMD1, KRT14 etc. GO enrichment analysis showed that theseDEGs were highly enriched for molecular function of ATP binding and calcium ionbinding, cellular process of focal adhesion, and biological process of immuneresponse, and defense response to virus. Similarly, KEGG pathways analysisrevealed 11 significantly enriched pathways such as ECM-receptor interaction,cell cycle, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, ABC transporters etc. In theprotein-protein interaction (PPI) network, CDK1 was found to be a top hub genewith highest degree of connectivity. Three modules selected from the PPI network showed that canine lymphoma was highly associated with cell cycle, ECM-receptorinteraction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy and RIG-I-likereceptor signaling pathway. Overall, our findings highlighted new candidatetherapeutic targets for further testing in canine lymphoma and facilitate theunderstanding of molecular mechanism of lymphoma's progression in dogs.

AB  - Leptospirosis is a neglected and severe zoonotic bacterial disease that affectscanine populations worldwide, and it is present in animals from differentsettings, such as urban and rural environments. Therefore, a cross-sectionalstudy was conducted on owned domestic dogs from urban and rural origins insouthern Chile. The study aimed: 1) to estimate the true prevalence of pathogenicLeptospira in dogs from urban and rural environments in southern Chile, 2) todetermine the serovars circulating in an endemic area of Chile, 3) to assesspotential risk factors associated with seropositivity in dogs from urban andrural environments. Blood samples from 706 canines were collected, and the serum was tested with Micro-Agglutination-Test (MAT), using a panel of 13 serovars. ABayesian approach was applied to estimate True prevalence (TP). In addition, dog owners answered a questionnaire that had prompts regarding dog characteristicsand potential risk factors. The effect of these factors on the risk of beinginfected was analysed using a logistic regression model. The TP for urban dogswas 9.4% and 9.1% for rural animals. However, seroprevalence was higher in dogswith different individual, lifestyle, and habitat characteristics regarding theirorigin. For example, in urban animals, those living in places with rodentsroaming near houses and dogs with rodent hunting habits had decreased risk forthe seropositivity in MAT. On the other hand, in rural dogs, those of arecognized breed, with contact with cattle and sheep, living with more than onecat at home and living in places close to natural water sources have more risk toseropositivity in MAT. The presence of anti-Leptospira antibodies is widespreadin pet dogs in urban and rural environments in southern Chile, and individual,lifestyle and habitat characteristics of the animals, according to the origin,are associated with the seropositivity in MAT. Therefore, the adoption ofpreventive measures is urgent, in addition to increase the awareness either inpublic health institutions, practitioners and companion animals' owners,considering the zoonotic potential of Leptospira infection and the close contact between people and their pets.

AB  - Investigations into teeth mechanical properties provide insight intophysiological functions and pathological changes. This study sought to 1)quantify the spatial distribution of elastic modulus, hardness and themicrostructural features of dog dentin and to 2) investigate quantitativerelationships between the mechanical properties and the complex microstructure ofdog dentin. Maxillary canine teeth of 10 mature dogs were sectioned in thetransverse and vertical planes, then tested using nanoindentation and scanningelectron microscopy (SEM). Microstructural features (dentin area fraction anddentinal tubule density) and mechanical properties (elastic modulus and hardness)were quantified. Results demonstrated significant anisotropy and spatialvariation in elastic modulus, hardness, dentin area fraction and tubule density. These spatial variations adhered to a consistent distribution pattern; hardness, elastic modulus and dentin area fraction generally decreased from superficial to deep dentin and from crown tip to base; tubule density generally increased fromsuperficial to deep dentin. Poor to moderate correlations between microstructuralfeatures and mechanical properties (R(2) = 0.032-0.466) were determined. Theresults of this study suggest that the other constituents may contribute to themechanical behavior of mammalian dentin. Our results also present severalremaining opportunities for further investigation into the roles of organiccomponents (e.g., collagen) and mineral content on dentin mechanical behavior.

AB  - Studies in cats and dogs have proven the usefulness of anti-Mullerian hormone(AMH) as a diagnostic tool to determine the castration status or to diagnoseovarian remnant syndrome. Yet the secretion pattern of AMH over the estrous cyclein queens has not been investigated so far. Seven healthy sexually intact female cats were examined daily for signs of estrous behavior over a trial period of 4months. Five queens showed regular estrous behavior, 1 queen was mated in herfirst heat and 1 queen never showed any signs of heat. To distinguish betweeninter-estrus and metestrus progesterone levels were determined. Serum samples forAMH and progesterone measurement were collected from the regular cycling queensin late anestrus, at several times during heat, inter-estrus and metestrus, from the mated queen during her first heat and during pregnancy, and in the acyclingqueen at various times during the trial period. The measured AMH values inanestrus were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than in heat (P < 0.001), metestrus(P = 0.12) and inter-estrus (P = 0.449). In anestrus the median AMH levels were10.26 ng/ml (range 4.96 to 22.90 ng/ml), in heat 5.97 ng/ml (range 3.32- 22.96ng/ml), in inter-estrus 10.47 (range 3.35-22.96 ng/ml) and in metestrus 6.38ng/ml (range 4.50-10.75 ng/ml. The pregnant cat showed median AMH concentrations of 6.47 ng/ml (range 5.60-9.80 ng/ml) during her pregnancy. The acycling queenhad solely low AMH values with a median concentration of 0.39 ng/ml. Inconclusion there were high variations of the AMH levels among and within theindividual cats and between heat cycles in the single cat. Remarkable high AMHconcentrations were measured in the younger queens of the study in their firstestrous cycles and also in anestrus, when less ovarian activity is expected.Further studies are necessary to emphasize the reasons for these high AMHconcentrations especially in young queens.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Meniscal allograft transplantation (MAT) has been developed as atreatment for meniscal deficiency. Despite promising outcomes, there are noreal-time methods to evaluate graft survivorship and predict functional outcomes.HYPOTHESIS: Assessment of serum and urine biomarkers could be used to developbiomarker panels-prognostic (1- and 3-month postsurgical time points) anddiagnostic (6-month time point)-based on strong associations with clinicallyrelevant outcome metrics obtained 6 months after surgery. STUDY DESIGN:Descriptive laboratory study. METHODS: Twelve adult purpose-bred research hounds were included and underwent medial meniscal release to induce meniscaldeficiency. Three months after meniscal release surgery, medial menisci werereplaced with fresh-frozen meniscus (n = 4), fresh meniscus (n = 4), or freshmeniscotibial osteochondral allograft (n = 4) such that a spectrum of pain andfunctional outcomes could be anticipated. Serum and urine from all dogs werecollected preoperatively and at 1, 3, and 6 months after MAT surgery. Dogs wereassessed for pain-related and functional outcomes at the same time points. Todevelop a prognostic panel of biomarkers, biomarker data from the 1- and 3-month post-MAT surgery time points were used to model 6-month clinical outcomes. Adiagnostic panel of biomarkers was developed using data from the 6-month post-MATsurgery to model 6-month clinical outcomes. Primary outcomes for pain andfunction were visual analog scale (VAS) and operated limb percentage totalpressure index (%TPI), respectively. Using random subject effects, linear mixedmodels were used to develop prognostic biomarker panels, and linear fixed-effect models were used to develop diagnostic biomarker panels, with variance explained for each panel reported (R(2)) along with individual biomarker relationships.RESULTS: Across prognostic biomarker panels, a panel including serum IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-18 was fit for the primary functional outcome, operated limb %TPI(R(2) = 0.450), whereas a panel including serum CTX-II and OPG was fit for theprimary pain-related outcome, VAS (R(2) = 0.516). Across diagnostic biomarkerpanels, a panel including serum MMP-1 and MMP-3 and urine PINP and TIMP-1 was fitfor %TPI (R(2) = 0.863). Separately, a panel including urine CTX-I, CTX-II, IL-8,MMP-2, and TIMP-1 was fit as diagnostic biomarkers for the VAS for pain (R(2) =0.438). CONCLUSION: Biomarker panels of selected serum and/or urine proteins can model clinically relevant metrics for function and pain in a preclinical model ofMAT. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Biomarker panels could be used to provide real-timediagnostic and prognostic data regarding outcomes after MAT.

TI  - Histotripsy Ablation of Spontaneously Occurring Canine Bone Tumors In Vivo.
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2022.3191069 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Osteosarcoma (OS) is a devastating primary bone tumor in dogs andhumans with limited non-surgical treatment options. As the first completelynon-invasive and non-thermal ablation technique, histotripsy has the potential tosignificantly improve the standard of care for patients with primary bone tumors.INTRODUCTION: Standard of care treatment for primary appendicular OS involvessurgical resection via either limb amputation or limb-salvage surgery forsuitable candidates. Biological similarities between canine and human OS make thedog an informative comparative oncology research model to advance treatmentoptions for primary OS. Evaluating histotripsy for ablating spontaneous canineprimary OS will build a foundation upon which histotripsy can be translatedclinically into a standard of care therapy for canine and human OS. METHODS: Fivedogs with suspected spontaneous OS were treated with a 500 kHz histotripsy systemguided by real-time ultrasound image guidance. Spherical ablation volumes within each tumor (1.25-3 cm in diameter) were treated with single cycle histotripsypulses applied at a pulse repetition frequency of 500 Hz and a dose of 500pulses/point. RESULTS: Tumor ablation was successfully identified grossly andhistologically within the targeted treatment regions of all subjects. Histotripsytreatments were well-tolerated amongst all patients with no significant clinical adverse effects. Conclusion & Significance: Histotripsy safely and effectivelyablated the targeted treatment volumes in all subjects, demonstrating itspotential to serve as a non-invasive treatment modality for primary bone tumors.

TI  - De novo transcriptome sequencing and functional annotation of Demodex canis.
LID - 10.1007/s10493-022-00727-6 [doi]
AB  - Demodex canis is an important parasitic mite causing skin lesions in dogs.However, molecular studies on this species are limited because of the lack oftranscriptomic data. To obtain functional genes of D. canis, mites were collectedand RNA was extracted for transcriptome sequencing and functional annotation.Coding sequences (CDSs) of important functional genes were screened andidentified using bioinformatics strategies. Six complete CDSs were amplified byspecific primers, cloned and sequenced. Results demonstrated that the quantity ofthe RNA extracted from 100 mites was 12.8 ng and the RNA integrity number was5.4, indicating that it could be used to construct a cDNA library. Transcriptome sequencing yielded 263,619 unigenes, of which 151,048 (57.3%) were functionallyannotated. Using bioinformatics strategies, 58 total CDSs were identified ashomologous to those of closely related mite species, including 16 types ofallergen genes, 13 types of protease genes, and nine types of motion-relatedgenes. The verified CDSs were almost identical to the CDSs of unigenes.Phylogenetic analyses of tropomyosin further revealed that the verified CDSsclustered successively with those of Demodex species and Tetranychus species inRaphignathae, which agreed with the morphological classification, demonstratingthe reliability of the transcriptomic data. In conclusion, this study is thefirst to successfully sequence transcriptome of D. canis, perform functionalannotation, and verify CDSs, which will provide ample data for further studies onthe functional genes and molecular pathogenic mechanism of D. canis.

AB  - Concurrent Clostridium piliforme and canine distemper virus (CDV) infection wasdiagnosed in 2 canine littermates and 1 gray fox kit from Texas, USA. In all 3animals, intracytoplasmic, filamentous bacteria, consistent with C. piliforme,were present along the margins of foci of hepatic necrosis. Additional histologicfindings included intracytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusion bodies in bile ductand bronchial epithelial cells of the fox kit, and mild intestinal necrosis in 1 puppy. PCR assays confirmed the presence of C. piliforme in all 3 animals, CDV inboth puppies, and canine parvovirus in 1 puppy. Fluorescent antibody testingconfirmed the presence of CDV in the fox kit. Concurrent canine distemper andTyzzer disease in canine littermates and the gray fox has not been reportedpreviously, to our knowledge.

AB  - Meningioangiomatosis (MA) is a rare proliferative meningovascular entity that hasbeen described mainly in humans and dogs. Here we describe MA in a 13-y-oldspayed female domestic shorthaired cat that died 5 d after acute change inbehavior, open-mouth breathing, seizures, hyperthermia, and inability to walk. OnMRI, the lesion appeared predominantly as extraparenchymal hemorrhage. Autopsychanges consisted of a dark-red, hemorrhagic plaque that expanded theleptomeninges and outer neuroparenchyma of the right piriform and temporaltelencephalic lobes, chalky white nodules in the peripancreatic fat, and yellowfluid in the abdomen. Histologically, the lesion in the brain consisted ofleptomeningeal thickening by spindle cells that effaced the subarachnoid spacesand extended perivascularly into the underlying cerebral cortex. Spindle cellswere arranged as streams or whorls around blood vessels, and had slendereosinophilic cytoplasm and elongated nuclei with coarsely stippled chromatin and 1 or 2 distinct nucleoli. There was extensive hemorrhage, clusters ofhemosiderin-laden macrophages, and mineralization throughout. Spindle cells hadpositive immunolabeling for vimentin. A striking MRI and gross feature in ourcase was the extensive hemorrhage associated with the MA lesion. Additionalfindings included suppurative pancreatitis with peritonitis and supraspinatusmyonecrosis.

AB  - Rationale: Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cells can becandidates for engineering therapeutic vascular grafts. Methods: Here, we studiedthe role of three-dimensional culture on their characteristics and function both in vitro and in vivo. Results: We found that differentiated hPSC-EC canre-populate decellularized biomatrices; they remain viable, undergo maturationand arterial/venous specification. Human PSC-EC develop antifibrotic, vasoactive and anti-inflammatory properties during recellularization. In vivo, a robustincrease in perfusion was detected at the engraftment sites after subcutaneousimplantation of an hPSC-EC-laden hydrogel in rats. Histology confirmed survivaland formation of capillary-like structures, suggesting the incorporation ofhPSC-EC into host microvasculature. In a canine model, hiPSC-EC-seeded ontodecellularised vascular segments were functional as aortic grafts. Similarly, we showed the retention and maturation of hiPSC-EC and dynamic remodelling of thevessel wall with good maintenance of vascular patency. Conclusions: A combinationof hPSC-EC and biomatrices may be a promising approach to repair ischemictissues.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Triatomine elimination efforts and the interruption of domestictransmission of Trypanosoma cruzi are hampered by pyrethroid resistance.Fluralaner, a long-lasting ectoparasiticide administered to dogs, substantiallyreduced site infestation and abundance of pyrethroid-resistant Triatoma infestansKlug (Heteroptera: Reduviidae) in an ongoing 10-month trial in Castelli (ChacoProvince, Argentina). We assessed the effects of fluralaner on vector infectionwith T. cruzi and blood meal sources stratified by ecotope and quantified itsmedium-term effects on site infestation and triatomine abundance. METHODS: Weconducted a placebo-controlled, before-and-after efficacy trial of fluralaner in 28 infested sites over a 22-month period. All dogs received either an oral doseof fluralaner (treated group) or placebo (control group) at 0 monthpost-treatment [MPT]. Placebo-treated dogs were rescue-treated with fluralaner at1 MPT, as were all eligible dogs at 7 MPT. Site-level infestation and abundancewere periodically assessed by timed manual searches with a dislodging aerosol.Vector infection was mainly determined by kDNA-PCR and blood meal sources weredetermined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: In fluralaner-treatedhouseholds, site infestation dropped from 100% at 0 MPT to 18-19% over the period6-22 MPT while mean abundance plummeted from 5.5 to 0.6 triatomines per uniteffort. In control households, infestation dropped similarly post-treatment. The overall prevalence of T. cruzi infection steadily decreased from 13.8% at 0-1 MPT(baseline) to 6.4% and subsequently 2.3% thereafter, while in domiciles, kitchensand storerooms it dropped from 17.4% to 4.7% and subsequently 3.3% thereafter.Most infected triatomines occurred in domiciles and had fed on humans.Infected-bug abundance plummeted after fluralaner treatment and remained marginalor nil thereafter. The human blood index of triatomines collected in domiciles,kitchens and storerooms highly significantly fell from 42.9% at baseline to5.3-9.1% over the period 6-10 MPT, increasing to 36.8% at 22 MPT. Dog blood mealsoccurred before fluralaner administration only. The cat blood index increasedfrom 9.9% at baseline to 57.9-72.7% over the period 6-10 MPT and dropped to 5.3% at 22 MPT, whereas chicken blood meals rose from 39.6% to 63.2-88.6%. CONCLUSION:Fluralaner severely impacted infestation- and transmission-related indices overnearly 2 years, causing evident effects at 1 MPT, and deserves larger efficacytrials.

TI  - Minimally invasive mini-hemilaminectomy-corpectomy in cadaveric dogs: evaluation of the accuracy and safety of a three-dimensionally printed patient-specificsurgical guide.
PG  - 271
LID - 10.1186/s12917-022-03374-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As the frequency of spine surgery increases in the veterinary field, many studies have been conducted on minimally invasive spine surgery (MISS).Although many studies have been conducted on the thoracolumbar spine about MISSin animals, several problems and limitations have emerged regarding this method. Therefore, we developed a three-dimensional (3D) printed patient-specificsurgical guide (3DPSSG) using 3D printing technology to overcome these problems. We aimed to evaluate the accuracy and safety of the 3DPSSG in minimally invasive mini-hemilaminectomy-corpectomy (MI-MHC). MI-MHC using 3DPSSG and an endoscopicsystem was performed at L1-L2 in 15 cadaveric dogs. The procedure of fixing thesurgical guide to the vertebral body through screws and the surgical procedureusing the guide were performed by two surgeons with different experiences.Postoperative computed tomography was used to measure planned and postoperativescrew trajectories (angle, protruding from the far cortex) and to create 3Drendering images of vertebrae to evaluate the direction of bone window formation,corpectomy slot length, depth, and height ratio. RESULTS: The two groups whichperformed by two surgeons with different experiences did not differ in terms ofscrew angle deviation and length of the screw protruded from the far cortex. The corpectomy slot-length ratio was not different between the two groups; however,the slot-depth and height ratios were different. CONCLUSIONS: No differences weredetected in screw trajectory and corpectomy slot-length ratio between the twogroups. The 3DPSSG for MI-MHC is classified as accurate and safe; therefore, itcan be an alternative to the conventional technique in dogs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Canine cloning technology based on somatic cell nuclear transfer(SCNT) combined with genome-editing tools such as CRISPR-Cas9 can be used tocorrect pathogenic mutations in purebred dogs or to generate animal models ofdisease. RESULTS: We constructed a CRISPR-Cas9 vector targeting canine DJ-1.Genome-edited canine fibroblasts were established using vector transfection andantibiotic selection. We performed canine SCNT using genome-edited fibroblastsand successfully generated two genome-edited dogs. Both genome-edited dogs hadinsertion-deletion mutations at the target locus, and DJ-1 expression was either downregulated or completely repressed. CONCLUSION: SCNT successfully producedgenome-edited dogs by using the CRISPR-Cas9 system for the first time.

PG  - 272
LID - 10.1186/s12917-022-03375-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) can provide objective functionalassessment of the post-retinal visual pathway. This study compared the effects ofsedation (butorphanol and dexmedetomidine) and general anesthesia (propofol andsevoflurane) on pattern and flash VEPs. Dogs (n = 13) underwent sedation oranesthesia and VEPs were obtained from 3 subcutaneous recording electrodes placedon the head (O1, Oz, O2). RESULTS: Pattern VEPs could only be recorded undersedation and a maximum of 3 peaks were identified (N75, P100, N135). Flash VEPscould be recorded under both sedation and anesthesia and a maximum of 5 peakswere identified (N1, P1, N2, P2, N3). The latency of the N1 peak and thebaseline-N1 amplitude were significantly longer under general anesthesia.CONCLUSION: Visual evoked potentials should be preferentially recorded in dogssedated with dexmedetomidine and butorphanol, regardless of the stimulus.

TI  - Clinical and Hematologic Findings in Babesia canis Infection in Eastern Slovakia.
LID - 10.1007/s11686-022-00584-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Babesia canis infection occurs in many locations throughout Europe.However, various studies report different clinicopathological findings inaffected dogs. This study was focused on changes in clinical and hematologicparameters in dogs with B. canis infection from eastern Slovakia. METHODS: Thestudy was prospective and included 45 dogs with suspected babesiosis. Babesiacanis infection was confirmed by PCR in 34 cases and by blood smear microscopy in24 (70.6%) of them. Hematology results, clinical examination from these dogs, andpossible co-infection with other tick-borne pathogens by PCR were subsequentlyevaluated. RESULTS: The major clinical signs found included lethargy (91%), fever(59%), anorexia (59%), pigmenturia (47%) and icterus (18%). Mortality rate was6%. Thrombocytopenia was the most common hematologic change, observed in 100% of the dogs with B. canis infection. Other frequent findings were lymphopenia (82%) and anemia (68%). No co-infections were detected. Anaplasma phagocytophiluminfection was diagnosed by PCR only in one dog, which was not infected with B.canis. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that B. canis infection in eastern Slovakiashould be diagnosed by PCR when there is clinical suspicion of the disease, asalmost 30% of the infected sick dogs did not have demonstrable parasites in theirblood smear by microscopy. Lymphopenia is a frequent hematologic finding in B.canis infection and observed even more often than anemia. However, in agreementwith previous studies, thrombocytopenia remains the most common hematologicfinding associated with B. canis infection.

LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-16050-4 [doi]
AB  - In single-port thoracoscopic lobectomy, surgical instruments are likely tocollide and interfere with each other. We used magnetic anchor technique todesign an anchoring device suitable for thoracoscopic surgery, and verified thesafety and feasibility of its use in animal experiments. Ten Beagles were used asmodels, and magnetic anchor technology was used to assist thoracoscopiclobectomy. During the operation, a self-designed magnetic anchored internalgrasper was used in place of the traditional laparoscopic grasping forceps. Theoperation time, intraoperative blood loss, incidence of postoperativecomplications, and the effect of intraoperative use of the device were analyzed. All 10 beagles were successfully operated; the mean operation time was 19.7 +/-3.53 min (range 15-26 min), and the postoperative blood loss was < 10 mL. Nosurgical complications occurred.

TI  - Ventriculomegaly in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with Chiari-like malformation:relationship with clinical and imaging findings.
LID - 10.1292/jvms.22-0134 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this study was to calculate lateral ventricles dimension inCavalier King Charles Spaniel dogs with Chiari-like malformation and investigate the association between ventriculomegaly and signalment, clinical signs,ventricular asymmetry, grade of Chiari-like malformation, syringomyelia and indexof medullary kinking. Retrospectively, 43 client-owned Cavalier King CharlesSpaniels, older than 1 year of age, with magnetic resonance imaging diagnosis of Chiari-like malformation were enrolled. Initial and follow-up (up to 36 months)clinical status was graded. Images were reviewed to quantify the enlargement oflateral ventricles, evaluate ventricular symmetry, grade of Chiari-likemalformation, grade of syringomyelia and medullary kinking index. Casespresenting epileptic seizures during the evaluation period were also recorded.The most common initial clinical signs were scratching and neck pain.Ventriculomegaly was identified in 70% of dogs, Chiari-like malformation grade 2 was observed in 77% of cases, ventricular asymmetry and syringomyelia wereidentified in 54% and 80% of dogs, respectively; the median medullary kinkingindex was 37.77%. Moreover, 28% of dogs presented epileptic seizures. Nosignificant association was identified between dimension of lateral ventriclesand signalment, clinical signs, and imaging findings; no significant association was identified between ventriculomegaly and epilepsy (P>/=0.05). In conclusion,the prevalence of ventriculomegaly in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels is high but this finding does not seem related to the severity of clinical signs, presence ofChiari-like malformation, syringomyelia and craniocervical junction abnormalitiessuch as medullary kinking.

TI  - Exploring the effect of implementing affordable socially assistive pet robots in eight care homes before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: a stratified clusterrandomised controlled trial and mixed-method study.
LID - 10.2196/38864 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Robot pets may assist towards challenges of supporting an agingpopulation with growing dementia prevalence. Prior work focused on impacts ofrobot seal Paro on older adult wellbeing, but recent studies suggest goodacceptability and implementation feasibility of more affordable devices (Joy for All (JfA) cats and dogs). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to respond to limited effectivenessresearch. METHODS: We conducted an eight-month, stratified, cluster randomisedcontrolled trial, in eight care homes in Cornwall, UK. Over four months, fourcare homes each received two JfA devices (one cat and dog), and four homesreceived care as usual (intervention and control group). Psychometrics werecollected pre and post intervention, to compare change from baseline to follow-upin the intervention vs control group. In the final four months, all eight carehomes had devices, but only qualitative data was collected, due to Covid-19 andreduced capacity. The primary outcome was neuropsychiatric symptoms(Neuropsychiatric Inventory - Nursing Home version (NPI)). Care provider burdenwas a secondary outcome (occupational disruptiveness NPI subscale), alongside theChallenging Behaviour scale, Holden Communication scale, Campaign to EndLoneliness questionnaire and medication use. Qualitative data was collectedthrough care staff observation calendars and end-of-study interviews tounderstand use, experience and impact. We also collected demographic data andassessed dementia severity. In total, 253 residents had robot interactionopportunities, and 83 were consented for direct data collection. RESULTS: Therewas a significant difference in total change from baseline to follow-up for NPI(p=.000) and occupational disruptiveness (p=.031) scores between the interventionand control group. Neuropsychiatric symptoms increased in the control group,while decreasing in the intervention group. No significant difference was seenfor communication issues or challenging behaviour. On NPI sub-domains, there was a significant difference from baseline to follow-up for delusions (p=.034),depression (p=.010), anxiety (p=.001), elation (p=.023) and apathy (p=.009), all of which decreased in the intervention group and increased slightly in thecontrol group. The summative impact results suggested most residents whointeracted with robots received a positive impact (85%, 46/54). Those whointeracted had significantly higher dementia severity scores (p=.001) than those who did not interact. The qualitative results suggested good adoption andacceptability, suitability for subjectively lonely individuals, lack of noveltyeffect through sustained use and demonstrated 'reasons for use' of robots wereentertainment, anxiety and agitation. CONCLUSIONS: Affordable robot pets holdpotential in improving wellbeing for care home residents and people withdementia, including reduced neuropsychiatric symptoms and occupationaldisruptiveness. This work suggests no novelty effect, and contributes towardsunderstanding robot pet suitability, finding interactions were more common among residents with more moderate/severe dementia and potentially those subjectivelylonely. CLINICALTRIAL: This trial was pre-registered on Clinicaltrials.gov(https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04168463), and is reported following the CONSORT 2010 statement: extension to cluster randomised trials.

TI  - Retrospective evaluation of the ST segment electrocardiographic features in 180healthy dogs.
LID - 10.1111/jsap.13532 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Normal features of the ST segment are poorly characterised in dogs.This study aimed to describe ST segment characteristics in a population ofhealthy dogs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records were reviewed to identifyhealthy dogs that underwent an electrocardiogram. Several ST segment qualitative parameters were evaluated: presence/absence of deviation, type of deviation(depression/elevation) and morphological patterns of depression (horizontal,downsloping, upsloping and sagging) and elevation (horizontal, concave andconvex). Moreover, the amplitude of ST segment depression/elevation was measured.The potential effect of sex, bodyweight, age and somatotype on thepresence/absence of ST segment deviation was evaluated through binary logisticregression. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty dogs were enrolled. The deviation wasevident in 43 of 180 dogs (23.9%), among which 36 showed depression and sevenshowed elevation. The median depression amplitude was 0.1 (range 0.05 to 0.3) mV.The mean elevation amplitude was 0.136 +/-0.055 mV. Concerning depressionmorphology, the horizontal pattern was overrepresented, followed by thedownsloping and upsloping ones. Concerning elevation morphology, all dogs showed a concave pattern. No meaningful effect of sex, bodyweight, age and somatotype onthe presence/absence of ST segment deviation was documented. CLINICALSIGNIFICANCE: Normal features of canine ST segment were described and madeavailable for clinical use.

AB  - In vertebrates, newly emerging transformed cells are often apically extruded fromepithelial layers through cell competition with surrounding normal epithelialcells. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here, usingphospho-SILAC screening, we show that phosphorylation of AHNAK2 is elevated innormal cells neighboring RasV12 cells soon after the induction of RasV12expression, which is mediated by calcium-dependent protein kinase C. In addition,transient upsurges of intracellular calcium, which we call calcium sparks,frequently occur in normal cells neighboring RasV12 cells, which are mediated by mechanosensitive calcium channel TRPC1 upon membrane stretching. Calcium sparksthen enhance cell movements of both normal and RasV12 cells throughphosphorylation of AHNAK2 and promote apical extrusion. Moreover, comparablecalcium sparks positively regulate apical extrusion of RasV12-transformed cellsin zebrafish larvae as well. Hence, calcium sparks play a crucial role in theelimination of transformed cells at the early phase of cell competition.

TI  - Treatment and outcomes of five dogs with intrathoracic migration of porcupinequills.
LID - 10.1111/vsu.13860 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the perioperative findings and outcomes in dogs thatunderwent exploratory thoracotomy following porcupine quill migration and report (1) the use of traction alone for the removal of superficial quills in thepulmonary parenchyma, and (2) the use of exploratory pericardiotomy for theincidental identification of cardiac quills. ANIMALS: Five client-owned dogs.STUDY DESIGN: Short case series. METHODS: Medical records of dogs withpneumothorax or pericardial effusion secondary to porcupine quill migration from January 2019 to January 2022 were reviewed. Advanced imaging and a mediansternotomy were performed in each dog. Demographics, preoperative findings,surgical treatment, and outcome were recorded. RESULTS: Pulmonary quills weretreated with gentle traction or lung lobectomy. The intraoperative palpation orappearance of the pericardium prompted pericardiotomy in three dogs, exposingepicardial and intravascular quills. No evidence of these quills was detected on preoperative advanced imaging or on gross appearance of the pericardium. Quillswere removed with a combination of gentle traction, purse-string sutures, andmattress sutures. Pneumothorax and pericardial effusion resolved postoperatively in all dogs. All dogs survived to discharge. CONCLUSION: Traction allowed removalof quills that were superficially attached to the pulmonary parenchyma withoutthe need for subsequent lobectomy. Epicardial and myocardial quills were detectedfollowing pericardiotomy in three dogs despite the absence of quills grosslypenetrating the pericardium. Preoperative imaging did not allow consistentdetection of quills.

TI  - Incomplete histological margins following planned narrow excision of canineappendicular soft tissue sarcomas and mast cell tumors, using the residual tumor classification scheme.
LID - 10.1111/vsu.13852 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the frequency of incomplete histological margins followingplanned narrow excision (PNE) of mast cell tumors (MCTs) and soft tissue sarcomas(STSs), and to assess the residual tumor classification (R) scheme for reporting histological margins in clinical cases. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective clinicalstudy. SAMPLE POPULATION: Forty-four client-owned dogs with 47 masses. METHODS:Medical records of dogs undergoing planned narrow excision of STSs and MCTs were reviewed (2016-2019). Histologic specimens were reviewed by a single pathologist and assigned R scoring (histologically incomplete/R1 margins defined as "tumor onink"). RESULTS: Six out of 23 (26%) MCT PNEs and 10/42 (42%) of STS PNEs resultedin R1 margins. R1 margins were more likely when performing PNE with 6-10 mmlateral measured surgical margins (LMSMs) versus 0-5 mm LMSM for MCTs (1/14 vs5/9), but not STSs (3/7 vs 7/17) (P = .049). The R scheme resulted in higherretrospective percentage agreement in histological reporting than definingincomplete histological margin as tumor cells within </=1 mm of the margin (83%vs 68% agreement). Complications occurred in 12/47 surgeries, with none requiringadditional surgery. Tumors recurred in 3/18 (17%) STSs and 2/18 (11%) MCTs.CONCLUSION: Fewer R1 margins were obtained when PNE with LMSM of 6-10 mm wasperformed for mast cell tumors. The use of the R scheme increased agreement inhistopathological margin assessment. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Planned narrowexcision is a viable technique for histopathological diagnosis of appendicularsoft tissue sarcomas and mast cell tumors for limb salvage.

TI  - Genetic characterization and evolutionary analysis of canine parvovirus inTangshan, China.
LID - 10.1007/s00705-022-05502-x [doi]
AB  - Canine parvovirus (CPV) is a major enteric virus of carnivores worldwide thatposes a considerable threat to dogs. In this study, we investigated the geneticvariation of CPV in Tangshan, China, and the relationships between CPV diseaseand the vaccination status, age, and gender of dogs. Seventy-seven fecal samples from dogs in Tangshan that tested positive for CPV were obtained for analysis.Twenty-two full-length VP2 gene sequences were successfully amplified. The 22strains included 17 CPV-2c variants, four new CPV-2a variants, and one new CPV-2bvariant. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all of the CPV-2c strains clusteredtogether and were closely related to CPV-2c strains from Asia but distantlyrelated to CPV-2c strains from Europe. Further amino acid sequence analysisshowed that, relative to CPV-2c strains from Europe, most of the CPV-2c stains inthis study had A5G, F267Y, Y324I, and Q370R mutations. These findings provide amore comprehensive understanding of the variants of CPV circulating in China.

TI  - Use of vasopressors for treatment of vasodilatory hypotension in dogs and cats byDiplomates of the American College of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care.
LID - 10.1111/vec.13230 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the most common practices of Diplomates of the AmericanCollege of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care (DACVECCs) as they relate tothe recognition and treatment of hypotension in dogs and cats, particularlyconcerning the use of vasopressors in vasodilatory shock states. DESIGN: A surveyregarding vasopressor use was sent to all active DACVECCs using the VeterinaryInformation Network. Questions focused on respondent characteristics, method ofrecognition of hypotension, triggers for initiation of vasopressor therapy,first- and second-line vasopressor choice, and methods of determining response totherapy. SUBJECTS: A total of 734 DACVECCs were invited to participate, and 203Diplomates (27.7%) completed the survey. RESULTS: For both dogs and cats, themost common first-line vasopressor was norepinephrine (87.9% in dogs and 83.1% incats). The most common second-choice vasopressor was vasopressin (44.2% in dogsand 39.0% in cats). Cutoff values for initiating vasopressor therapy variedbetween species and modality used for blood pressure measurement. In general,most DACVECCs chose to initiate vasopressor therapy at a Doppler blood pressure<90 mm Hg or a mean arterial pressure of <60 or <65 mm Hg when usingoscillometric or direct arterial blood pressure measurements in dogs and cats.CONCLUSIONS: Most DACVECCs adhere to published human guidelines when choosing afirst-line vasopressor. However, there is significant variability in bloodpressure measurement technique, cutoffs for initiation of vasopressor use, andchoice of second-line vasopressors.

AB  - Metabolism data for MCPA in rat, dog and human shows a single oral dose isquantitatively and rapidly absorbed with evidence of non-linear kinetics at >100 mg/kg bw. The extent of metabolism is low and consistent between rat and human,with substantially higher metabolic conversion in dog. Parent accounts for50%-67% dose in rat, approximately 40% in human and 2%-27% in dog. No dogspecific metabolite is apparent.In rat and human, MCPA and metabolites arerapidly eliminated in urine (65%-70% within 24 h) but in dog, excretion is viaurine and faeces (20%-30% within 24 h), with renal excretion saturating between 5and 100 mg/kg bw.The species difference in excretion is reflected inpharmacokinetics. Terminal half-life is similar in rat and human (15-17 h) buthigher in dog (47 h). Modelling shows species differences in single dose kineticsprofoundly affect systemic exposure following repeat dosing.The difference inrenal excretion and systemic exposure of MCPA between dogs and rats has beenattributed to species differences in active transporters (OAT1/OAT3). A new invitro flux study in renal proximal tubules supports this hypothesis with netsecretion in rat and human of a similar magnitude but significantly less in dog.

TI  - Adjustment of multi-leaf collimator parameters in 4-MV and 6-MV IMRT: A study of veterinary clinical cases.
PG  - 407-413
LID - 10.5455/OVJ.2022.v12.i3.15 [doi]
AB  - Background: For optimal treatment, it is important to maintain optimal multi-leafcollimator (MLC) transmission in intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).However, adjustment of transmissions has not been reported in veterinarymedicine. Aim: To demonstrate that appropriate MLC parameter adjustment for IMRT using 4- and 6-MV energy can reduce the need for quality assurance revalidationin real companion animal clinical cases. Methods: The MLC parameters (leaftransmission and leaf offset) of the treatment planning system were adjusted byevaluating seven plans (10 x 10 cm, 3ABUT, DMLC, 7segA, FOURL, HDMLC, and HIMRT) and 20 preclinical cases (10 cases each in 4- and 6-MV groups). Subsequently, 101IMRT plans of 88 cases (77 dogs and 11 cats) were evaluated for absolute dose of plan target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OAR) and were analyzed for therelative dose distribution by gamma analysis (3%/3 mm, >10%) using EBT3 film.Results: After adjustment of the MLC parameters (leaf transmission and leafoffset, 4 MV: 0.008 and 0, 6 MV: 0.005 and 0, respectively), the data from 101plans (4 MV: 64 plans and 6 MV: 37 plans) treated with IMRT showed PTV <3%, OAR<5%, and gamma analysis pass rates >/=95% in all cases. Conclusion: Clinicallymeaningful dose distributions can be created even with a limited validationdevice if the treatment parameters are adjusted appropriately, even for tumors incanines and felines, where the irradiation field is small, the target is adjacentto the OAR, and the target is often superficial.

PG  - 383-390
LID - 10.5455/OVJ.2022.v12.i3.12 [doi]
AB  - Background: Radiation therapy is considered important for the treatment ofintranasal tumors in dogs and is believed to be essential for prolonging theirsurvival. Aim: To investigate the contribution of clinical staging to improveoutcomes of megavoltage radiotherapy for canine intranasal tumors. Methods: Atotal of 123 dogs with intranasal tumors were included in the study. Forty-eight dogs received orthovoltage radiotherapy after cytoreductive surgery (Group I), 21received orthovoltage radiotherapy without surgery (Group II), and 54 receivedmegavoltage radiotherapy without surgery (Group III). All cases in each groupwere classified into clinical stages 1-4, and the median survival time (MST) was compared for each stage in all groups. Results: The overall MST was notsignificantly difference among Group I (325 days), Group II (317 days), and GroupIII (488 days); however, Group III was prolonged than Groups I and II. The MSTsfor stages 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 597, 361, 267, and 325 days in Group I; 633, 260, 233, and 329 days in Group II; and 931, 860, 368, and 176 days in Group III,respectively. The MST for stage 2 cases in Group III was significantly prolonged when compared with that in Groups I and II; no significant difference wasobserved at other stages; however, the MST in Group III was longer in stage 1.These results showed that megavoltage radiotherapy prolonged the MST in dogs withintranasal tumors when compared to orthovoltage radiation with or withoutcytoreductive surgery, and that improvements in MST at stage 2 contributedsignificantly to this. Conclusion: The improvement in the MST in dogs with stages1 and 2 intranasal tumors highlights the importance of starting megavoltageradiotherapy in the early stages.

PG  - 360-369
LID - 10.5455/OVJ.2022.v12.i3.9 [doi]
AB  - Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in dogs, most frequently diagnosed as chronic AF associated with a structural heart disease.The therapeutic strategy, in these cases, is based on the heart rate control and digoxin is one of the most used drugs. Aim: The aim of this work was to study theserum digoxin concentration changes in dogs with AF under long-term treatmentwith digoxin. Furthermore, the remission of clinical signs and the correlationbetween digoxinemia and other clinical and laboratory variables wereretrospectively evaluated. Methods: The prospective study was conducted on seven large breed dogs from the time of reaching the definitive digoxin dosage.Digoxinemia was determined at month: 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, then twice a year. A posthoc statistical analysis investigated the influence of selected clinical andlaboratory variables on the risk to develop spikes in digoxinemia. Clinical data,heart rate, digoxin dosage (mg/m(2)), and digoxinemia (ng/ml) at all availablefollow-ups were retrospectively evaluated from the medical records of 17 further dogs and a linear regression analysis was performed on the whole data set. Therelation between the time of remission of AF clinical signs and variables wasalso investigated. Results: An unexpected increase in digoxin serum concentrationwas recorded in three dogs after one year monitoring, in absence of digoxindosage changes. No statistical significance of all the studied variables on therisk to develop spikes of digoxinemia was registered. Two dogs, reachingdigoxinemia 4.46 and 5.24 ng/ml, showed symptoms that reversed after digoxinwithdrawal. From retrospective data, 88% of dogs reached complete reverse of AFclinical signs in 2.1 months from digoxin treatment starting, regardless ofdigoxin initial dosage, digoxinemia, and heart rate. Conclusion: Digoxin inmonotherapy remain a good option to treat AF in dogs, anyway digoxin toxicitycould emerge during long-term therapy, similarly to what happen in humanmedicine. Life-threatening spikes of digoxinemia could occur, especially after1-year treatment with digoxin. It is very important that practitioners be awareof this possibility and encourage the owners to monitor digoxinemia duringlong-term treatment to avoid dangerous and toxic effects.

AB  - Background: Portal vein thrombosis is a disease with potentially deleteriousoutcomes including portal vein hypertension and intestinal infarction. Thefactors contributing is various; however, dogs with with acute portal veinthrombosis or multiple thromboses are less likely to survive. Therefore, acutedevelopment of portal hypertension has a requires an immediate treatment. CaseDescription: A 10-year-old Dalmatian was referred for syncope and azotemia,hyperammonemia. After each examinations including computed tomography scan, wediagnosed with acute portal vein thrombosis with unknown cause. A portal veinport was inserted to prevent and control the portal vein thrombus. The port wasplaced in abdomen subcutaneously after the position of the catheter werestabilized. Low-molecular-weight heparin was injected from the port to managethrombosis after the operation. This case responded well to this treatment.Syncope and azotemia, hyperammonemia resolved and no relapse of thrombosis wasfound 6 months after the operation. Conclusion: Implantable vascular access port is a drug delivery system with the advantage of dealing with treatment-resistant acute portal vein thrombosis.

AB  - Background: Today, animals, like humans, suffer from spinal illnesses, which are aggravated in old age. Much emphasis is placed on diagnosis and treatment, butlittle focus is given to the spine's mechanical properties. Degenerative spinediseases are a major problem throughout the world. According to the World Health Organization, osteoporosis is a world-class public problem that reduces bonemass, resulting in bone fracturing and increased risk of bone fracturing.Therefore, the mechanical investigation of vertebrae can provide more informationabout the development of osteoporosis.s. Case Description: For our case report,we used spayed mongrel lumbar vertebrae samples obtained from a canine which was about 8 years old and weighed 28 kg. The dog was diagnosed with a mammary tumor, and its owners decided to euthanize the dog. All consent forms were filled.Conclusion: Mechanical tests were performed on three vertebrae, and a notabledifference was observed in the first cycle of the first vertebra (L1).Second-order polynomials for displacement and seventh-order polynomials forpressure were proposed for describing the stress-strain relationship of thevertebrae under the cyclical loads. Our research protocol has been broken downinto several parts. After measuring the area of the loaded surface, the largestarea was in the L2 vertebra (176 +/- 16 mm; 177 +/- 3 mm) and the smallest was inthe L7 vertebra (156 +/- 4 mm; 151 +/- 33 mm). The smallest distance was recordedbetween the first (L1) and seventh (L7) lumbar vertebrae (L1) (15.17 +/- 0.93mm), and the largest distance was recorded between the L3 and L4 vertebrae of thelumbar (19.8 +/- 3.7 mm).

TI  - Biomechanical cyclic loading test of a synthetic ligament fixation system usedfor intra-articular stabilization of deficient canine stifles.
PG  - 341-350
LID - 10.5455/OVJ.2022.v12.i3.6 [doi]
AB  - Background: Cranial cruciate ligament rupture (CCLr) is the most common cause of hind limb lameness in dogs. Currently, surgical management of CCLr is mostlyperformed using tibial osteotomy techniques to modify the biomechanicalconformation of the affected stifle. These surgical techniques have a significantcomplication rate, associated with persistent instability of the stifle which maylead to chronic postoperative pain. Over the last decade, studies have beenpublished on various techniques of anatomical caudal cruciate ligamentreconstruction in veterinary practice, using physiological autografts or wovensynthetic implants. Aim: The aim of this ex vivo biomechanical study is toinvestigate the ex vivo dynamic biomechanical behavior of a synthetic implant[ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) implant] fixed withinterference screws for the treatment of CCLr in dogs, according to a fatigueprotocol (48 hours per test). Methods: Seven stifles from four skeletally mature canine cadavers were implanted with the synthetic implant. It was fixed with fourinterference screws inserted in transversal and oblique tunnels in both thedistal femur and the proximal tibia. For each case, 100,000 cycles were performedat 0.58 Hz, with traction loads ranging from 100 to 210 N. Results: Neitherscrew-bone assembly rupture nor a pull-out issue was observed during the dynamic tests. Linear stiffness of the implants associated with a fixation system withfour interference screws increased over time. The final displacement did notexceed 3 mm for five of the seven specimens. Five of the seven synthetic implantsyielded to a lengthening in functional range (0-3 mm). Linear stiffness washomogeneous among samples, showing a strong dynamic strength of the interference screw-based fixations of the UHMWPE implant in the femoral and tibial bones.Conclusion: This study completes the existing literature on the biomechanicalevaluation of passive stifle stabilization techniques with a testing protocolfocused on cyclic loading at a given force level instead of driven bydisplacement. These biomechanical results should revive interest inintra-articular reconstruction after rupture of the CCLr in dogs.

PG  - 375-382
LID - 10.5455/OVJ.2022.v12.i3.11 [doi]
AB  - Background: Tibiotarsal instabilities caused by partial or complete rupture ofthe medial collateral tarsal ligament (MCTL) are commonly treated by arthrodesis techniques with poor functional results and significant complication rates. Case Description: This study describes a new surgical technique for syntheticreconstruction of the MCTL in an overweight dog (estimated body condition score8/9) with an avulsion of the long head of the MCTL. Three bone tunnels weredrilled in the distal tibia, the talus, and the central tarsal bone, thusrespecting the anatomical insertions of the physiological ligament. An Ultra-HighMolecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE) implant was fixed with interference screwsto reconstruct the long and short heads of the MCTL. Premature weight-bearing wasreported at 2 weeks postoperatively following early removal of the flexiblerestraint (bivalve resin boot), which had initially been prescribed for 6 weeks. At 11 weeks postoperatively, the tibiotarsal joint showed good valgus stabilityand the dog's gait was subnormal. At 12 and 16 months postoperatively, the dogregained full function of the operated limb although no weight loss was initiatedas recommended. Conclusion: The use of a UHMWPE implant fixed with interferencescrews to reconstruct the MCTL allowed a return to full function of thetibiotarsal joint, without complications despite an early return toweight-bearing without external restraint. The success of this isolated surgical technique could lead to improvements in the surgical management of MCTL ruptureif these initial results are confirmed by a prospective study with a largernumber of patients.

PG  - 351-355
LID - 10.5455/OVJ.2022.v12.i3.7 [doi]
AB  - Background: Medial patellar luxation (MPL) is a common orthopedic condition indogs. After surgical correction, the recurrent rates appear to be higher andoutcomes worse in grade IV than in lower grade MPL. Aim: To describe the outcomesof surgical correction of canine grade IV MPL. Methods: This retrospective study analyzed the medical records of 16 dogs (11 females, 5 males; mean age = 5.05years) with 22 stifle joints (8 left and 14 right) that underwent MPL surgery at Rakuno Gakuen University between May 2015 and October 2020. The proceduresincluded capsulorrhaphy, trochlear block recession, tibial tuberositytransposition, medial retinacular release, and lateral fabellotibial suturing.The types of postsurgical complications, including a recurrence of MPL, wererecorded. Results: Twelve of the 16 (75 %) dogs had concurrent contralateral MPL,and 2 dogs (12.5%) had concurrent cranial cruciate ligament rupture. The meanfollow-up was 12.1 months. No lameness was observed. The outcomes of surgery for grade IV MPL were not associated with bilateral surgery, age, sex, body weight,or the preoperative quadriceps angle. Although none of the dogs showed any major or catastrophic complications following surgery, postoperative minor and majorcomplications were observed in 8 of the 22 stifle joints (36.4%). Conclusion:Grade IV MPL is a complex orthopedic disease in dogs, which requires surgicalpatellar realignment to improve limb function. The surgical techniques used inthis study were associated with a good prognosis without a surgical revision.

AB  - Background: Achilles mechanism rupture is a surgical condition involving primary tenorrhaphy with various described means of surgical augmentation and bolstering.Aim: To report complications and outcomes with a novel Achilles repair technique in dogs using a superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) or deep digital flexortendon (DDFT) allograft. Methods: Medical records were reviewed for dogs withchronic rupture or deterioration of the Achilles mechanism. Fibrous tissue wasexcised and either primary tenorrhaphy or reattachment of the tendon(s) to thecalcaneus was performed. The surgical repair was supplemented by an SDFT or DDFT allograft, and postoperative immobilization was provided using a transarticularhybrid external skeletal fixator. Complications were classified as minor, major, or catastrophic, and function was classified as full, acceptable, orunacceptable, based on established guidelines. Results: Complications occurredwith 6 out of 12 repairs, including 1 minor, 6 major, and 2 catastrophiccomplications. The two catastrophic complications were the recurrence of tarsalhyperflexion and lameness at 20 weeks and 18 months following surgery. Of the 12 surgeries performed, 2 resulted in full function, 8 with acceptable function, and2 with unacceptable function at last follow-up 17-98 weeks postsurgery (mean = 45weeks) for a success rate of 10/12 cases. Conclusion: The use of SDFT or DDFTallografts, coupled with an external fixator, can provide a moderate rate of fullor acceptable functional outcomes and appears a viable treatment. However,complications were frequent and without a comparison group no conclusions can be drawn about the inferiority or superiority of this technique to other techniques for Achilles mechanism repair in dogs.

AB  - Background: The endolymphatic sac is an organ devoid of sensory receptors. It is connected with the endolymphatic compartment and contains endolymph.Endolymphatic sac tumor (ELST) is a rare neoplasm involving the middle and inner ear described in humans and dogs that does not show cellular characteristics ofmalignancy, but can be locally invasive and involve destruction of the temporalbone and adjacent structures. Case Description: An 8-month-old female cat wasreferred because of sudden onset of vestibular signs starting 3 days prior toreferral. On clinical examination, the patient showed depression, right headtilt, left-sided facial paralysis, and horizontal nystagmus with fast phase tothe left. The magnetic resonance images showed a voluminous extra-axial lesion,with irregular morphology and well-defined margins, with intracranial extensionin the region of the pons, rostral medulla oblongata, cerebellar vermis,floccule, and left cerebellar hemisphere. Due to progressive clinicaldeterioration, the cat was euthanized 2 weeks later. A necropsy was thenperformed and histological samples were taken. The necropsy revealed the presenceof a voluminous dark red irregular mass extending from the tympanic bulla to the posterior cranial fossa following the left glossopharyngeal nerve. Thehistopathological exam of the extra-axial lesion featured a nonencapsulated,moderately cellular, rather loose, proliferation of cuboidal to columnarepithelium breaching through chunks of an otherwise normal appearing dura materand invading some cranial nerves. Sections of the cerebellum and brainstemrevealed moderate, focal, impingement of the parenchyma with a very mildextension of the proliferating cells into the ventral left side of the medullaoblongata. Based on these histological characteristics, the lesion was defined asELST, a rare neoplasm described in human beings and with two reports in dogs.Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first report describing an ELST in acat.

TI  - Contrasting treatment responses by Burkholderia cepacia complex-related deeppyoderma: A series of two cases.
PG  - 308-311
LID - 10.5455/OVJ.2022.v12.i3.1 [doi]
AB  - Background: The Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) is an opportunistic pathogenin humans and animals. Deep pyoderma caused by these bacteria in dogs has beenpreviously reported. This case series aims to describe contrasting treatmentresponses in Bcc-related deep pyoderma in two dogs, a male and a female. CaseDescription: Both patients had a history of immune-mediated polyarthritis (IMPA) managed with oral ciclosporin and prednisolone. Their skin lesions weremultifocal, irregular, erythematous to hemorrhagic, alopecic papules, plaques,and nodules, with extensive crusting, draining tracts, and ulceration.Cytological findings revealed a marked inflammatory response consisting ofnon-degenerative and degenerative neutrophils and macrophages, with moderate toabundant intracellular and extracellular Bcc. Ciclosporin and prednisolone werestopped in case 2 after diagnosis. However, it was challenging to stop theregimen in case 1 because of the recurrence of IMPA and the onset of iatrogenichypoadrenocorticism. Case 1 did not achieve remission for approximately 66 weeks even with seven protocols because of multiple relapses, whereas it took only 3weeks to achieve remission in case 2 while using one drug. Conclusion: For deeppyoderma with extensive lesions in immunosuppressed patients, one should considerinfection with Bcc. Therefore, immunosuppressants should promptly be reduced insuch patients, and then, intensive antimicrobial therapy may achieve remission.

TI  - Cutaneous epitheliotropic T-cell lymphoma in a donkey - a case report.
PG  - 267
LID - 10.1186/s12917-022-03365-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cutaneous epitheliotropic T-cell lymphoma is a malignant tumour ofthe skin already reported in humans, dogs, cats, horses, and other species, butnot previously in donkeys. The standard diagnosis is based on clinical,morphological and immunophenotypic data. Differentiation of malignant versusbenign proliferation of lymphocytes is crucial; in ambiguous cases T-cellreceptor gamma (TRG) molecular clonality should be tested. In the present paper, we report a case of mycosis fungoides diagnosed in a donkey whose diagnosis wasbased on clinical, histological and immunohistochemical aspects and a positiveTRG clonality test. CASE PRESENTATION: A twenty-five-year-old donkey gelding was referred with a mildly pruritic, generalised and severe exfoliative dermatosis.Otherwise, the animal was clinically healthy, though mildly underweight.Dermatological examination revealed severe generalised alopecic and exfoliativedermatitis, occasionally eroded, with high number of large, thin, greyish scales.All mucocutaneous junctions except the hoofs were affected. Ectoparasites anddermatophytes were ruled out. The complete blood count and blood smear evaluationrevealed mild normocytic normochromic anemia. The biochemistry panel showed mild hyperproteinemia with albumin within the normal range. Protein electrophoresisshowed moderate polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. Histological findings werecharacterised by interface dermatitis with massive exocytosis in the epidermis ofa homogenous population of lymphoid cells showing atypia. Clusters of neoplastic cells were present within the epidermis forming Pautrier "microabscesses". These findings are consistent with cutaneous epitheliotropic lymphoma.Immunohistochemical staining revealed uniform labelling of the neoplastic cellsfor CD3, and lack of expression of CD20 (a B cell lineage associated marker).Molecular clonality PCR (PARR) was performed using equine TRG primers; thisrevealed a clonal rearrangement in a heavy polyclonal background. Transmissionelectronic microscopy showed multiple lymphocytes with convoluted or cerebriform nuclei. CONCLUSIONS: This case report provides the first evidence of clinical,histopathological, immunophenotypic features, electron microscopy findings andmolecular analysis of a cutaneous epitheliotropic T-cell lymphoma (mycosisfungoides) in a donkey. Our observations suggest that cutaneous T-cell lymphomashould be included in the differential diagnoses of exfoliative dermatitis, even those progressing in a chronic pattern and/or with few or no pruritus.

LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-16117-2 [doi]
AB  - Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) is one of the most prevalentpathogenic nontuberculous mycobacteria that cause chronic pulmonary disease. The prevalence of MAC infection has been rising globally in a wide range of hosts,including companion animals. MAC infection has been reported in dogs; however,little is known about interaction between MAC and dogs, especially in immuneresponse. In this study, we investigated the host immune response driven by M.intracellulare using the co-culture system of canine T helper cells andautologous monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Transcriptomic analysis revealed that canine MDMs differentiated into M1-like macrophages after M. intracellulare infection and the macrophages secreted molecules that induced Th1/Th17 cellpolarization. Furthermore, canine lymphocytes co-cultured with M.intracellulare-infected macrophages induced the adaptive Th17 responses after 5days. Taken together, our results indicate that M. intracellulare elicits a Th17 response through macrophage activation in this system. Those findings might help the understanding of the canine immune response to MAC infection and diminishing the potential zoonotic risk in One Health aspect.

TI  - Epidemiology of canine mammary tumours on the Canary Archipelago in Spain.
PG  - 268
LID - 10.1186/s12917-022-03363-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mammary gland tumours are the most frequently diagnosed tumours inthe female dogs but just a few studies have analysed their epidemiology.Therefore, we set out to describe the epidemiology of canine mammary cancer inthe Canary Archipelago, Spain. We analysed a pathology tumour registry (PTR) and identified 7362 samples obtained from 5240 female dogs resident on the CanaryArchipelago during an 18-year period (2003-2020). Using a case-control studydesign, we compared mammary tumour affected dogs with the Canarian caninepopulation registry in order to elucidate the breed associations for thesetumours. RESULTS: The frequency of a diagnosis of mammary tumours relative to alltumour diagnoses in female dogs decreased during the study period from 62.7% to48.9%. Contemporaneously, the proportion of dogs diagnosed with mammary tumourswho were also neutered increased from 13.6% to 26.9%. There was a negativecorrelation (R = -0.84) between these changes. Additional findings were that: theproportion of female dogs diagnosed with multiple tumours increased by 23.5% and that the proportion of malignant tumours 89.2% diagnosed has remained stablethrough the period. Benign mammary tumours were diagnosed at younger ages (9.2years old) than carcinomas (9.7 years old) and sarcomas (10.4 years old).Epithelial mammary tumours were diagnosed at younger ages in entire female dogs. Samoyed, Schnauzer, Poodle, German Pinscher and Cocker Spaniel were the breedswith the highest odds-ratios (OR) in comparison with the reference (crossbreeds) while Miniature Pinscher, American Staffordshire Terrier, English Pointer as wellas some local breeds such as the Canary Warren Hound and the Majorero had thelowest ORs. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a description of the changingepidemiology of canine mammary cancer in the Canary Archipelago over the last twodecades. We found high rates of CMT with a significant predominance of malignant tumours. Exact risk factors are uncertain, but a combination of environmental,regional socioeconomic affecting human and their pets, and animal managementfactors are likely to play a part. Specifically, neutering was negativelyassociated with the proportion of epithelial mammary gland tumours and breedsnative to the region were at lower risk of mammary tumours. A deeper analysis of all these factors will facilitate a deeper understanding of the epidemiology ofmammary gland tumours in both the canine and the human population.

AB  - Human and dog health are inextricably linked, and although our relationship with dogs brings numerous benefits for our well-being, it is known that they cantransmit disease. Bariloche is a Patagonian tourist city with heterogeneoussocial composition. This cross-sectional study evaluates the population offree-roaming dogs and their intestinal parasites in relation to the socioeconomiclevel of the city's human population. Census areas were used as survey units,stratified in three levels according to socioeconomic status. The free-roamingdog population was estimated by walking around each census area. Eight freshfeces per census count area were collected and analyzed usingcoproparasitological flotation tests, and CoproELISA was used to detectEchinococcus sp. A total of 858 free-roaming dogs were registered along 40.9 km, with significant differences between socioeconomic strata: the highest numberswere found in the lowest income strata. Of the feces collected, 39.2% testedpositive for parasites, those associated with a lower socioeconomic level having higher percentages of positive feces and a greater number of species. Eightspecies of helminths were found, some of which were zoonotic, such asEchinococcus sp., Toxocara canis, and Dibothriocephalus latus. The presence ofparasites can be explained by the number of free-roaming dogs per census countarea. The free-roaming dogs generally have owners, and their parasitic infection is strongly associated with the socioeconomic level of the population. The mainproblem is irresponsible pet care, which generates healthy conditions for bothdogs and humans. Thus, both dogs and humans deserve effective ethical publicpolicies.

AB  - Pulmonary hypertension (PH) triggers hemodynamic changes within the right heart, which may affect hepatic venous flow. The aims of this study were three-fold: to investigate, prospectively, the reliability of the hepatic vein Doppler waveform to diagnose and characterize the magnitude of PH in dogs; to evaluate whether acorrelation exists between hepatic venous flow waves and the structural andfunctional characteristics of the right ventricle (RV); and to determine whether age, gender, body weight, heart rate (HR), heart rhythm and systolic bloodpressure affect the hepatic venous waveform pattern. A cross-sectionalobservational study was carried out in 43 dogs with varying degrees of PH and acontrol group of 15 healthy dogs. The velocities of the hepatic A, S, V and Dspectral waves and the phasic pattern varied according to the severity of PH.Weak to moderate correlations were documented between hepatic vein waves and age,HR, and the structural and functional variables of the RV. A D Wave cut-off of11.6 cm s-1 had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 35% for differentiation of dogs with severe PH from healthy dogs. Doppler assessment of hepatic venousflow was shown to be a reliable technique for screening dogs for PH.

TI  - Metabolism regulator adiponectin prevents cardiac remodeling and ventriculararrhythmias via sympathetic modulation in a myocardial infarction model.
PG  - 34
LID - 10.1007/s00395-022-00939-2 [doi]
AB  - The stellate ganglia play an important role in cardiac remodeling aftermyocardial infarction (MI). This study aimed to investigate whether adiponectin(APN), an adipokine mainly secreted by adipose tissue, could modulate the leftstellate ganglion (LSG) and exert cardioprotective effects through thesympathetic nervous system (SNS) in a canine model of MI. APN microinjection and APN overexpression with recombinant adeno-associated virus vector in the LSG wereperformed in acute and chronic MI models, respectively. The results showed thatacute APN microinjection decreased LSG function and neural activity, andsuppressed ischemia-induced ventricular arrhythmia. Chronic MI led to a decrease in the effective refractory period and action potential duration at 90% anddeterioration in echocardiography performance, all of which was blunted by APNoverexpression. Moreover, APN gene transfer resulted in favorable heart ratevariability alteration, and decreased cardiac SNS activity, serum noradrenalineand neuropeptide Y, which were augmented after MI. APN overexpression alsodecreased the expression of nerve growth factor and growth associated protein 43 in the LSG and peri-infarct myocardium, respectively. Furthermore, RNA sequencingof LSG indicated that 4-week MI up-regulated the mRNA levels ofmacrophage/microglia activation marker Iba1, chemokine ligands (CXCL10, CCL20),chemokine receptor CCR5 and pro-inflammatory cytokine IL6, and downregulatedIL1RN and IL10 mRNA, which were reversed by APN overexpression. Our resultsreveal that APN inhibits cardiac sympathetic remodeling and mitigates cardiacremodeling after MI. APN-mediated gene therapy may provide a potentialtherapeutic strategy for the treatment of MI.

TI  - Prevalence and phylogenetic analysis of Babesia parasites in reservoir hostspecies in Fujian province, Southeast China.
LID - 10.1111/zph.12988 [doi]
AB  - Babesiosis is a tick-borne disease that mainly affects small mammals and has beenreported in at least five provinces in China. However, the host range andgeographical distribution of the parasite in Fujian province are unclear.Therefore, we investigated the prevalence and genetic characteristics of Babesia in Fujian province, Southeast China, between 2015 and 2020. Rodent blood samples were collected from 26 different surveillance sites across Fujian province.Genomic DNA was extracted to screen for Babesia infection using polymerase chain reaction based on 18S rRNA. DNA samples from 316 domestic goats, 85 waterbuffalo, 56 domestic dogs and 18 domestic pigs were examined. The prevalence ofBabesia was statistically analysed using the Chi-square test or Fisher's exacttest. Babesia infections were detected in 3.96% (43/1,087; 95%CI: 2.80%, 5.12%)of rodents and 1.26% (6/475; 95%CI: 0.26%, 2.26%) of other mammals. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that irrigated cropland, shrubs and forestswere risk factors for Babesia microti infections. The infection rates amongdomestic pigs, dogs and goats were 5.56%, 1.79% and 1.27%, respectively, with no infection found in water buffalo. The 18S rRNA gene sequencing revealed thatrodents were infected with Babesia (sensu lato), whereas other mammals wereinfected with Babesia (sensu stricto). The geographical distribution andphylogenetic relationship of Babesia was determined in Southeast China. Mammals, particularly wild rodents, maybe the main natural hosts of Babesia in Fujian. Ourfindings provide a foundation for public health officials to develop preventionand control measures for Babesia.

TI  - Seroprevalence of toxocariasis among allergic patients in Kuwait and itsassociation with eosinophilia.
PG  - e00260
LID - 10.1016/j.parepi.2022.e00260 [doi]
AB  - Toxocariasis is a worldwide helminthic infection which is transmitted frominfected dogs and cats and has been associated with peripheral bloodeosinophilia. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) placedtoxocariasis among the top 6 parasitic diseases in the USA which are prioritized for public health action. To our knowledge, there are no reports on humantoxocariasis in Kuwait or in the other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. This study aims at investigating the seroprevalence of toxocariasis amongallergic patients in Kuwait and its association with eosinophilia, age, gender,nationality, and history of direct contact with dogs or cats. From September toDecember 2021, the laboratory records of allergic patients referred to Al-Rashed Allergy Hospital, Kuwait were reviewed and a total of 400 serum samples wereselected: 200 samples from patients with normal eosinophil count (< 500cells/mul) and 200 samples from patients with eosinophilia (> 500 cells/mul). Thesera were screened for anti-Toxocara canis IgG antibodies via antibodyenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Ab-ELISA). The seropositive patients wereasked about their history of direct contact with dogs or cats. Statisticalanalyses were performed using Microsoft Excel(R) Analysis ToolPak software.Toxocariasis seropositivity was detected in 10 out of 400 (2.5%) allergicpatients. Five patients had eosinophilia while 5 had normal eosinophil count.There was no difference in mean age or gender between Toxocara-seropositive andseronegative patients (p > 0.05). The seroprevalence rate was lower-than-expectedamong Kuwaiti patients (2/307, 0.7%) in comparison with non-Kuwaiti patients(8/57, 14.0%) (chi2 = 33.603, df = 1, p < 0.001) who originated from endemicSouth/Southeast Asian countries. Seven out of 8 (87.5%) seropositive patients hada history of direct contact with cats, dogs, or both. The seroprevalence rate of toxocariasis among allergic patients in Kuwait was 2.5%. Raising awareness andearly deworming treatment/prophylaxis for juvenile dogs and cats remain crucialfor toxocariasis prevention.

TI  - Detection of SARS-CoV-2 by Canine Olfaction: A Pilot Study.
PG  - ofac226

AB  - Background: As the number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases continueto surge worldwide and new variants emerge, additional accurate, rapid, andnoninvasive screening methods to detect severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are needed. The number of COVID-19 cases reportedglobally is >455 million, and deaths have surpassed 6 million. Current diagnosticmethods are expensive, invasive, and produce delayed results. While COVID-19vaccinations are proven to help slow the spread of infection and prevent serious illness, they are not equitably available worldwide. Almost 40% of the world'spopulation remains unvaccinated. Evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2virus-associated volatile organic compounds found in the breath, urine, and sweatof infected individuals can be detected by canine olfaction. Medical detectiondogs may be a feasible, accurate, and affordable SARS-CoV-2 screening method.Methods: In this double-blinded, case-control, validation study, we obtainedsweat samples from inpatients and outpatients tested for SARS-CoV-2 by apolymerase chain reaction test. Medical detection dogs were trained todistinguish SARS-CoV-2-positive samples from SARS-CoV-2-negative samples usingreward-based reinforcement. Results: Samples were obtained from 584 individuals(6-97 years of age; 24% positive SARS-CoV-2 samples and 76% negative SARS-CoV-2samples). In the testing phase, all dogs performed with high accuracy indetecting SARS-CoV-2. The overall diagnostic sensitivity was 98%, and specificitywas 92%. In a follow-up phase, 1 dog screened 153 patients for SARS-CoV-2 in ahospital setting with 96% diagnostic sensitivity and 100% specificity.Conclusions: Canine olfaction is an accurate and feasible method for diagnosis ofSARS-CoV-2, including asymptomatic and presymptomatic infected individuals.

TI  - oVRcome - Self-guided virtual reality for specific phobias: A randomisedcontrolled trial.
PG  - 48674221110779
LID - 10.1177/00048674221110779 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Mobile health applications for mental health are widely accessible butmost have had limited research evaluation. Virtual reality exposure therapy is anemerging treatment for specific phobias. Most virtual reality studies haveinvestigated high-end virtual reality devices, typically only available inresearch and limited clinical settings for a single phobia. This study evaluated the effectiveness of oVRcome, a mobile health application combining self-guidedvirtual reality exposure and cognitive behaviour therapy, for five specificphobias. METHODS: This is a 2-arm 6-week randomised controlled trial, with awaitlist control group and follow-up at week 12. Participants were required tolive in New Zealand; be aged 18-64 years; have a fear of flying, heights,spiders, dogs and needles; score above 4 on the Brief Standard Self-rating scale for phobic patients; and have access to a smartphone and Internet. oVRcomeconsists of six modules of psychoeducation, relaxation, mindfulness, cognitivetechniques, exposure through virtual reality and relapse prevention over 6 weeks.The primary outcome was the change from baseline to week 6 on the SeverityMeasures for Specific Phobia - Adults. All analyses were performed onintention-to-treat set. RESULTS: A total of 126 participants were randomised, and109 completed the follow-up at week 6, for a retention rate of 86.5%. The meanchange in Severity Measures for Specific Phobia - Adults score from baseline toweek 6 was greater in the active group compared with the waitlist group (activegroup -20.53 [standard deviation = 8.24]; waitlist group: - 12.31 [standarddeviation = 10.66]; p < 0.001). The effect size for this difference was 0.86.CONCLUSION: Self-guided use of the oVRcome app was effective at reducing severityof specific phobia symptoms in a sample of people with a self-reported fear offlying, heights, spiders, dogs or needles.Trial registry clinicaltrials.govNCT04909177.

TI  - Review and statistical analysis of clinical management of feline leishmaniosiscaused by Leishmania infantum.
PG  - 253
LID - 10.1186/s13071-022-05369-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is limited information about feline leishmaniosis (FeL)management in clinical practice. Leishmania infantum is the species of Leishmaniamost frequently reported in both dogs and cats in countries of the Mediterranean region (henceforth 'Mediterranean countries'), Central and South America, andIran. This study was conducted to provide veterinary clinicians with an updatedoverview of evidence-based information on leishmaniosis in cats. METHODS: Areview was performed using PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar and Web ofScience. Case reports of FeL caused by L. infantum were sought for the period1912 to 1 June 2021. RESULTS: Sixty-three case reports are included in thisreview. Fifty-nine out of the 63 cats were from Europe, mostly from Mediterraneancountries (88.9%). Most of them were domestic short-haired cats (90%) with a meanage of 7.9 years, and had access to the outdoors (77.3%). Sixty-six percent ofthe cats had comorbidities, of which feline immunodeficiency virus infection was the most frequent (37.7%). Dermatological lesions (69.8%) was the most frequentclinical sign, and hyperproteinemia (46.3%) the most frequent clinicopathologicalabnormality. Serology was the most performed diagnostic method (76.2%) and waspositive for 93.7% of cats. Medical treatment was applied in 71.4% of cats, andallopurinol was the most used drug (74.4%). Survival time was greater for treatedcats (520 days; 71.4% of cats) than non-treated cats (210 days; 25.4%).CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the cats had comorbidities, of which felineimmunodeficiency virus was the most frequent. Dermatological lesions werefrequently reported, and systemic clinical signs and clinicopathologicalabnormalities were also common. Serology may be useful for the diagnosis of FeLin clinical practice, and a positive titer of >/= 1/40 may be a useful cut-offfor sick cats. The reported treatments and dosages varied, but there was a goodclinical response and longer survival in most of the cats treated withallopurinol monotherapy.

AB  - The domestic dog's olfactory sense is widely recognized as being highly sensitivewith a diverse function, however, little is known about the structure of theirolfactory system. This study examined a cohort of mixed sex mesaticephaliccanines and used Diffusion MRI (DTI), to map connections from the olfactory bulb to other cortical regions of the brain. The results were validated using theKlingler dissection method. An extensive pathway composed of five white mattertracts connecting to the occipital lobe, cortical spinal tract, limbic system,piriform lobe and entorhinal pathway was identified. This is the firstdocumentation of a direct connection between the olfactory bulb and occipitallobe in any species and is a step towards further understanding how the dogintegrates olfactory stimuli in their cognitive function.SignificanceStatementThe highly sensitive olfactory system of the domestic dog is largelyunexplored. We applied diffusion tractography and dissection techniques toevaluate the white matter connections associated with the olfactory system in alarge cohort of dogs. We discovered an extensive white matter network extendingfrom the olfactory bulb to form novel connections directly to other cortices ofthe brain. This is the first documentation of these novel olfactory connectionsand provides new insight into how the dog integrates olfactory stimuli in theircognitive functioning.

AB  - Pythiosis is an endemic disease in northeastern Brazil and we now report theepidemiological, clinical and pathological findings in a retrospective study ofnaturally occurring cases in domestic animals. From January 1985 to December2020, the Laboratory of Animal Pathology of the Federal University of CampinaGrande examined 13,542 tissue samples from necropsies and biopsies. Among thesesamples, 306 were diagnosed as pythiosis: 195 cases in horses, 75 in sheep, 19 indogs, six in mules, four in cattle, three in cats, two in goats, one in a donkey and one in an ostrich. Affected equids had lesions in the skin, mammary glandsand nasal cavities. Affected sheep had cutaneous, nasal and digestive lesionswhile cattle and goats had cutaneous lesions. Carnivores developed lesions,mainly in the alimentary tract, of sufficient severity to cause death or resultin euthanasia. The single affected bird had lesions in the alimentary tract andsurgical excision resulted in remission. The disease had a long andlife-threatening clinical course in most affected species but resolvedspontaneously in cattle. Clinical signs were directly related to the location of the lesions, which were invariably characterized by chronic inflammationassociated with intralesional hyphae. Veterinary clinicians and pathologistsshould be familiar with the clinicopathological features of pythiosis and thewide range of susceptible animal species.

AB  - A 3-year-old male Bichon Frise developed lethargy, anorexia and haematuria.B-scan ultrasonography examination revealed a small, irregular, soft-texturedmass in the bladder. Histopathologically, there was an incomplete fibrouspseudocapsule around the tumour tissue and although there was clear demarcationfrom the surrounding tissue, there was invasion of the capsule. Tumour cellsproliferated in nests or cords of variable size, separated by fibrovasculartissue. The neoplastic cells were immunopositive for chromogranin A,synaptophysin and neuron-specific enolase, and electron microscopy revealed that they contained cytoplasmic secretory granules. On the basis of these findings,the tumour was diagnosed as a primary paraganglioma of the urinary bladder.

TI  - Cross-linked hyaluronic acid gel with or without a collagen matrix in thetreatment of class III furcation defects: A histologic and histomorphometricstudy in dogs.
LID - 10.1111/jcpe.13694 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To histologically evaluate the effects of cross-linked hyaluronic acid(xHyA) with or without a collagen matrix (CM) on periodontal woundhealing/regeneration in class III furcation defects in dogs. MATERIALS ANDMETHODS: Class III furcation defects were surgically created in the mandibularpremolars in six beagle dogs. The defects were randomly treated as follows: open flap debridement (OFD) + CM (CM), OFD + xHyA (xHyA), OFD + xHyA + CM (xHyA/CM)and OFD alone (OFD). At 10 weeks, the animals were euthanized for histologicalevaluation. RESULTS: The newly formed bone areas in the xHyA (4.04 +/- 1.51 mm(2)) and xHyA/CM (4.32 +/- 1.14 mm(2) ) groups were larger than those in the OFD(3.25 +/- 0.81 mm(2) ) and CM (3.31 +/- 2.26 mm(2) ) groups. The xHyA (6.25 +/-1.45 mm) and xHyA/CM (6.40 +/- 1.35 mm) groups yielded statisticallysignificantly (p < .05) greater formation of new connective tissue attachment(i.e., new cementum, with inserting connective tissue fibres) compared with theOFD (1.47 +/- 0.85 mm) group. No significant differences were observed in any of the histomorphometric parameters between the xHyA and xHyA/CM groups. Completefurcation closure was not observed in any of the four treatment modalities.CONCLUSIONS: Within their limits, the present results suggest that the use ofxHyA with or without CM positively influences periodontal wound healing insurgically created, acute-type class III furcation defects.

AB  - Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato and Rhipicephalus turanicus are veryprevalent in Israel and are known to be vectors of human and animal diseases. Theaim of this study was to identify the pathogens found in questing ticks and such parasitizing domestic and wild animals. Ticks were collected from 16 localitiesin Israel with the flagging technique and by examining dogs, hedgehogs, a badger and a tortoise. Bacterial and protozoal pathogens were analyzed by PCR andsequencing. Overall, 374 R. sanguineus s.l. specimens were collected, out ofwhich 142 by flagging and 132 from six dogs. Rickettsia africae, Rickettsiamassiliae, Rickettsia conorii subsp. israelensis, and Anaplasma sp. wereidentified in ticks collected by flagging, Rickettsia aeschlimannii was foundonly in specimens collected from dogs, while Ehrlichia sp., Coxiella burnetii,Hepatozoon canis and Leishmania infantum were recorded in ticks collected byflagging and from dogs. Out of 226 specimens of R. turanicus, 124 were collected by flagging, while additional 33 from eight dogs, 64 from seven southernwhite-breasted hedgehogs (Erinaceus concolor), two from a European badger (Meles meles) and one from a Greek tortoise (Testudo graeca). Out of 65 R. sanguineuss.l. pools 17 (26.2%) had pathogens, while seven of them were positive for onepathogen, and 10 for two pathogens. In 43 R. turanicus pools, R. aeschlimannii R.africae, Rickettsia barbariae, R. massiliae, Anaplasma sp., Ehrlichia sp. and C. burnetii, as well as Babesia microti, B. vogeli, Hepatozoon felis, and L.infantum was detected, while Listeria monocytogenes, Bartonella sp. andToxoplasma gondii were negative in all R. sanguineus s.l. and R. turanicus pools examined. In conclusion, Babesia microti is reported for the first time inIsrael, R. africae, R. aeschlimannii, C. burnetii and L. infantum are reportedfor the first time in R. sanguineus s.l. and R. turanicus, while H. felis isreported for the first time from R. turanicus in the country.

TI  - Exposome Profiles and Asthma Among French Adults.
LID - 10.1164/rccm.202205-0865OC [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: While previous studies in environmental epidemiology have focused onsingle or a few exposures, a holistic approach combining multiple preventablerisk factors is needed to tackle the etiology of multifactorial diseases such as asthma. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between combined socioeconomic,external environment, early-life environment, lifestyle-anthropometric factorsand asthma phenotypes. METHODS: A total of 20,833 adults from the FrenchNutriNet-Sante cohort were included (mean age: 56.2 (sd: 13.2), 72% women). Thevalidated asthma symptom score (continuous) and asthma control (never-asthma,controlled asthma and uncontrolled asthma) were considered. The exposome (n=87factors) covered four domains: socioeconomic, external environment, early-lifeenvironment and lifestyle-anthropometric. Cluster-based analyses were performedwithin each exposome domain and the identified profiles were studied inassociation to asthma outcomes in negative binomial (asthma symptom score) ormultinomial logistic (asthma control) regression models. RESULTS: In total, 5,546(27%) individuals had an asthma symptom score >/=1, and 1,206 (6%) and 194 (1%)had controlled and uncontrolled asthma, respectively. Three early-life exposureprofiles ("high passive smoking-own dogs", "poor birth parameters-daycareattendance-city center" or ">/=2 siblings-breastfed" compared to "farm-petowner-molds-low passive smoking") and one lifestyle-anthropometric profile("unhealthy diet-high smoking-overweight" compared to "healthydiet-non-smoker-thin") were associated with more asthma symptoms and uncontrolledasthma. CONCLUSION: This large-scale exposome-based study revealed early-life andlifestyle exposure profiles that were at risk for asthma in adults. Our findings support the importance of multi-interventional programs for the primary andsecondary prevention of asthma including control of specific early-life riskfactors and promotion of healthy lifestyle in adulthood.

TI  - Modelling Japanese encephalitis virus transmission dynamics and human exposure ina Cambodian rural multi-host system.
PG  - e0010572
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010572 [doi]
AB  - Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a vector-borne zoonosis and the leading cause ofhuman viral encephalitis in Asia. Its transmission cycle is usually described as involving wild birds as reservoirs and pigs as amplifying hosts. JE is endemic inCambodia, where it circulates in areas with low pig densities (<70 pigs per km2),and could be maintained in a multi-host system composed of pigs, but also poultryas competent hosts, and dogs, cattle and humans as non-competent hosts. We used amathematical model representing Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) transmission ina traditional Cambodian village that we calibrated with field data collected in 3districts of Kandal province, Cambodia. First, R0 calculations allowed us toassess the capacity of the epidemiological system to be invaded by JEV andsustain virus transmission in villages in the 3 districts, and we predicted humanexposure at the epidemiological equilibrium, based on simulations. Changes inspatial density of livestock, in agricultural practices, and epizootics (e.g.,African swine fever), can profoundly alter the composition of host communities,which could affect JEV transmission and its impact on human health. In a secondstep, we then used the model to analyse how host community composition affectedR0 and the predicted human exposure. Lastly, we evaluated the potential use ofdog JE seroprevalence as an indicator of human exposure to JEV. In the modeledvillages, the calculated R0 ranged from 1.07 to 1.38. Once the equilibriumreached, predicted annual probability of human exposure ranged from 9% to 47%,and predicted average age at infection was low, between 2 and 11 years old,highlighting the risk of severe forms of JEV infection and the need to intensify child immunization. According to the model, increasing the proportion ofcompetent hosts induced a decrease in age at infection. The simulations alsoshowed that JEV could invade a multi-host system with no pigs, reinforcing theassumption of poultry acting as reservoirs. Finally, the annual human exposureprobability appeared linearly correlated with dog seroprevalence, suggesting thatin our specific study area, dog seroprevalence would be a good proxy for humanexposure.

TI  - Circulating MiR-30b-5p is upregulated in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels affected by early myxomatous mitral valve disease.
PG  - e0266208
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0266208 [doi]
AB  - There is a growing interest in developing new molecular markers of heart disease in young dogs affected by myxomatous mitral valve disease. The study aimed tomeasure 3 circulating microRNAs and their application as potential biomarkers in the plasma of Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with early asymptomatic myxomatousmitral valve disease. The hypothesis is that healthy Cavalier King CharlesSpaniels have different microRNA expression profiles than affected dogs inAmerican College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) stage B1. The profilescan differ within the same class among subjects of different ages. This is aprospective cross-sectional study. Thirty-three Cavalier King Charles Spaniels inACVIM stage B1 were divided into three groups (11 younger than 3 years, 11 older than 3 years and younger than 7 years, and 11 older than 7 years), and 11 healthy(ACVIM stage A) dogs of the same breed were included as the control group. Three circulating microRNAs (miR-1-3p, miR30b-5p, and miR-128-3p) were measured byquantitative real-time PCR using TaqMan(R) probes. Diagnostic performance wasevaluated by calculating the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC).MiR-30b-5p was significantly higher in ACVIM B1 dogs than in ACVIM A subjects,and the area under the receiver operating curve was 0.79. According to the age ofdogs, the amount of miR-30b-5p was statistically significantly higher in groupB1<3y (2.3 folds, P = 0.034), B1 3-7y (2.2 folds, P = 0.028), and B1>7y (2.7folds, P = 0.018) than in group A. The area under the receiver operating curveswere fair in discriminating between group B1<3y and group A (AUC 0.780), between B1 3-7y and A (AUC 0.78), and good in discriminating between group B1>7y and A(AUC 0.822). Identifying dogs with early asymptomatic myxomatous mitral valvedisease through the evaluation of miR-30b-5p represents an intriguing possibilitythat certainly merits further research. Studies enrolling a larger number of dogswith preclinical stages of myxomatous mitral valve disease are needed to expandfurther and validate conclusively the preliminary findings from this report.

PG  - e0271066
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0271066 [doi]
AB  - As ACE2 is the critical SARS-CoV-2 receptor, we hypothesized that aerosoladministration of clinical grade soluble human recombinant ACE2 (APN01) willneutralize SARS-CoV-2 in the airways, limit spread of infection in the lung, and mitigate lung damage caused by deregulated signaling in the renin-angiotensin(RAS) and Kinin pathways. Here, after demonstrating in vitro neutralization ofSARS-CoV-2 by APN01, and after obtaining preliminary evidence of its tolerabilityand preventive efficacy in a mouse model, we pursued development of an aerosolformulation. As a prerequisite to a clinical trial, we evaluated both virusbinding activity and enzymatic activity for cleavage of Ang II followingaerosolization. We report successful aerosolization for APN01, retaining viralbinding as well as catalytic RAS activity. Dose range-finding and IND-enablingrepeat-dose aerosol toxicology testing were conducted in dogs. Twice dailyaerosol administration for two weeks at the maximum feasible concentrationrevealed no notable toxicities. Based on these results, a Phase I clinical trial in healthy volunteers has now been initiated (NCT05065645), with subsequent PhaseII testing planned for individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

TI  - Pet ownership, loneliness, and social isolation: a systematic review.
LID - 10.1007/s00127-022-02332-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Several publications explored a relationship between pet ownership andlower levels of loneliness and social isolation. However, to the best of ourknowledge, no systematic review has yet synthesized the evidence on theseassociations. Thus, this systematic review aims to evaluate the findingsregarding the relations between pet ownership, loneliness, and social isolation. METHODS: PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycInfo were searched in January 2022.Observational studies relying on appropriate instruments to assess the exposureand the outcome variables were included. Two reviewers independently executedstudy selection, data extraction, and quality assessment. RESULTS: n = 24 studieswere included. Among adult samples, the studies examining the relationshipbetween pet ownership and social isolation found that owning a pet was associatedwith lower levels of social isolation. Concerning loneliness, studies that wereconducted after the outbreak of COVID-19 mostly showed that pet ownership cancontribute to lower levels of loneliness, but did not reveal an overallsignificant association until then. In turn, the studies that examined child and adolescent samples suggest that pet ownership was related to reduced lonelinessbefore COVID-19. Furthermore, most of the studies did not reveal any differences between dogs, cats, and other kinds of pets regarding their relationship toloneliness and social isolation. CONCLUSION: All in all, only a part of thestudies detected a significant association between pet ownership, loneliness and social isolation. However, the COVID-19 pandemic seemed to strengthen thisrelationship, so that future research is required to assess the longevity of thispotential effect.

TI  - Vector-borne disease and its relationship to hematologic abnormalities andmicroalbuminuria in retired racing and show-bred greyhounds.
PG  - 1287-1294
LID - 10.1111/jvim.16477 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reference intervals for platelets and white blood cell (WBCs) counts are lower in greyhounds than other breeds. Proteinuria is common. Vector-bornediseases (VBD) cause thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and proteinuria. Racinggreyhounds are commonly exposed to vectors that carry multiple organisms capable of chronically infecting clinically healthy dogs. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES:Vector-borne disease prevalence is higher in retired racing greyhounds than inshow-bred greyhounds. Occult infection contributes to breed-related laboratoryabnormalities. ANIMALS: Thirty National Greyhound Association (NGA) retiredracing and 28 American Kennel Club (AKC) show-bred greyhounds. METHODS:Peripheral blood was tested for Anaplasma, Babesia, Bartonella, Ehrlichia,hemotropic Mycoplasma, and Rickettsia species using PCR. Antibodies to Anaplasma,Babesia, Bartonella, Ehrlichia, and Rickettsia species and Borrelia burgdorferiwere detected using immunofluorescence and ELISA assays. Complete blood counts,semiquantitative platelet estimates, and microalbuminuria concentration weredetermined. RESULTS: Seven of 30 NGA and 1/28 AKC greyhounds tested positive for >/=1 VBD (P = .05). More positive tests were documented in NGA (10/630) than inAKC dogs (1/588; P = .02). Exposure to Bartonella species (3/30), Babesia vogeli (2/30), Ehrlichia canis (1/30), and infection with Mycoplasma hemocanis (3/30)occurred in NGA dogs. Platelet counts or estimates were >170 000/muL. White bloodcell counts <4000/muL (4/28 AKC; 5/30 NGA, P > .99; 1/8 VBD positive; 8/51 VBDnegative, P = .99) and microalbuminuria (10/21 AKC; 5/26 NGA, P = .06; 1/8 VBDpositive; 14/25 VBD negative, P = .41) were not associated with VBD. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The prevalence of thrombocytopenia and B. vogeliexposure was lower than previously documented. Larger studies investigating thehealth impact of multiple VBD organisms are warranted.

LID - 10.1111/jvim.16484 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to replicate in the veterinary context a BMJ study using Google to assist in diagnosis of complex cases.HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To assess percentage of diagnoses identified using Google as a diagnostic aid in veterinary medicine. ANIMALS: None; 13 cases in cats and17 in dogs published in JAVMA. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey of Google results from searches using keywords generated independently by a generalist and aspecialist veterinarian who reviewed the published case history and diagnosticcomponents while blind to the diagnosis. They offered diagnoses and generated up to 5 search strategies for each case. The top 30 Google results for each searchwere reviewed by the generalist to inform a final Google-aided diagnosis. Bothveterinarians' initial diagnoses and the Google-aided diagnoses were comparedwith the published diagnoses. RESULTS: Google searching led to 52 diagnoses outof 60 possible. Twenty-two (42%, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 29%-55%)Google-aided diagnoses matched the JAVMA diagnosis. This accuracy rate does notdiffer significantly from 58% (n = 15/26, 95% CI 38%-77%) identified in the BMJstudy. Google-aided results were not statistically different from those achieved unaided by each veterinarian (33%, 95% CI 16%-50%). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICALIMPORTANCE: Published information found searching Google using keywords relatedto complicated or unusual cases could assist veterinarians to reinforce theirinitial diagnosis or consider other differential diagnoses. Search strategiesusing words representing either signs or the preliminary diagnoses can yieldresults useful to confirming a correct diagnosis.

TI  - Targeted sequencing of candidate gene regions for myelofibrosis in dogs.
PG  - 1237-1247
LID - 10.1111/jvim.16476 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Myelofibrosis often lacks an identifiable cause in dogs. In humans,most primary myelofibrosis cases develop secondary to driver mutations in JAK2,CALR, or MPL. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of variants in JAK2, CALR, or MPL candidate regions in dogs with myelofibrosis and in healthy dogs. ANIMALS:Twenty-six dogs with myelofibrosis that underwent bone marrow biopsy between 2010and 2018 and 25 control dogs matched for age, sex, and breed. METHODS:Cross-sectional study. Amplicon sequencing of JAK2 exons 12 and 14, CALR exon 9, and MPL exon 10 was performed on formalin-fixed, decalcified, paraffin-embeddedbone marrow (myelofibrosis) or peripheral blood (control) DNA. Somatic variantswere categorized as likely-benign or possibly-pathogenic based on predictedimpact on protein function. Within the myelofibrosis group, hematologic variablesand survival were compared by variant status (none, likely-benign only, and >/=1 possibly-pathogenic). The effect of age on variant count was analyzed usinglinear regression. RESULTS: Eighteen of 26 (69%) myelofibrosis cases had somatic variants, including 9 classified as possibly-pathogenic. No somatic variants weredetected in controls. Within the myelofibrosis group, hematologic variables andsurvival did not differ by variant status. The number of somatic variants permyelofibrosis case increased with age (estimate, 0.69; SE, 0.29; P = .03).CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Somatic variants might initiate orperpetuate myelofibrosis in dogs. Our findings suggest the occurrence of clonalhematopoiesis in dogs, with increasing incidence with age, as observed in humans.

TI  - Subcutaneous vascular access port implantation in the axillary orfemoral/external iliac vein at the time of full limb amputation in dogs.
LID - 10.1111/vsu.13848 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report outcomes and complications after placement of a subcutaneousvascular access port (SVAP) in the jugular (jSVAP), axillary (aSVAP), and femoralor external iliac vein (fSVAP) in dogs. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective. METHODS:Medical records from a single hospital, covering a period between September 2015 and October 2020, were reviewed to identify dogs that had an SVAP placed.Complications and outcomes for dogs who had an SVAP placed in the axillary vein, or femoral/external iliac vein during amputation for appendicular skeletalneoplasm, and in the external jugular vein were recorded and analyzedstatistically. RESULTS: Subcutaneous vascular access ports were placed in theaxillary vein in 13 dogs, femoral/external veins in 4 dogs, and in the jugularvein in 19 dogs. The SVAPs fulfilled their purpose throughout treatment in 12/13 aSVAP, 4/4 fSVAP, and 15/19 jSVAP. Dogs were followed for a median of 145.5 days (range 30-945 days). Minor and major complications were recorded in 1/13 and 2/13aSVAPs, 0/4 and 0/4 fSVAPs, and 3/19 and 4/19 of jSVAPs. Two dogs with jSVAPswere euthanized due to SVAP-related complications. No difference in complication rate was detected between groups (P = .12). CONCLUSION: No difference inshort-term outcome was detected between implantation sites for subcutaneousvascular access ports. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The axillary or femoral/externaliliac veins offer alternative sites for placement of SVAP in dogs undergoing limbamputation.

TI  - Near-infrared fluorescent image-guided lymph node dissection compared withlocoregional lymphadenectomies in dogs with mast cell tumours.
LID - 10.1111/jsap.13529 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Near-infrared fluorescent imaging has been described forintraoperative mapping of the draining lymph nodes in human cancer and canineoral tumours. The aim of this study was to retrospectively describe the resultsof lymphadenectomies in dogs with mast cell tumours treated either by standardunguided locoregional lymph node dissection or near-infrared fluorescentimage-guided lymph node dissection. METHODS: Medical records between 2012 and2020 were reviewed for dogs that were presented for surgical resection of mastcell tumours with concurrent lymphadenectomy either with (near-infraredfluorescent image-guided lymph node dissection) or without near-infraredfluorescence image guidance (lymph node dissection). The number and location oflymph nodes planned for surgical dissection and actually dissected nodes,presence of metastases and perioperative complications were recorded. RESULTS:Thirty-five patients underwent near-infrared fluorescent image-guided lymph node dissection, and 43 lymph node dissections. The number of nodes preoperativelyplanned for resection were 70 and 68, respectively. Fifty-eight of those (83%)were identified during near-infrared fluorescent image-guided lymph nodedissection procedures, compared with 50 (74%) during lymph node dissection.near-infrared fluorescent image-guided lymph node dissection resulted inresection of additional fluorescent nodes not corresponding to locoregional nodesin 15 of 35 dogs. Using near-infrared fluorescent image-guided lymph nodedissection, we identified at least one metastatic node in 68% of dogs (24 of 35) compared with 33% (14 of 43) when lymph node dissection was used without imaging.No complications related to near-infrared fluorescent imaging were reported.CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The present study suggests that near-infrared imaging is apromising technique for intraoperative detection of the draining lymph nodes indogs with mast cell tumours. Further validation of the technique is required toassess if near-infrared fluorescent imaging can detect the true sentinel lymphnode.

TI  - Accuracy of Lumbosacral Pedicle Screw Placement in Dogs: A Novel 3D PrintedPatient-Specific Drill Guide versus Freehand Technique in Novice and ExpertSurgeons.
LID - 10.1055/s-0042-1750433 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of pedicle screwplacement at the canine lumbosacral junction using a novel unilateralthree-dimensional printed patient-specific guide (3D-PSG) versus a freehanddrilling technique. Additionally, accuracy of screw placement between a noviceand an experienced surgeon was determined. STUDY DESIGN: Preoperative computedtomography images from 20 lumbosacral cadaveric specimens were used to design anovel unilateral 3D-PSG for the L7 and sacral vertebrae which was printed inacryl-nitrile butadiene styrene plastic. A novice and an expert surgeon eachplaced 3.5mm cortical screws in 10 cadavers; on the left using the unilateral3D-PSG and by the freehand (anatomic landmark) technique on the right. RESULTS:Sixty screws were placed using the unilateral 3D-PSG and 60 using the freehandtechnique. There was no statistical difference in accuracy for the comparisonbetween methods performed by the expert (p = 0.679) and novice (p = 0.761)surgeon, nor between an expert and novice surgeon overall (p = 0.923).Unexpectedly, the use of a unilateral 3D-PSG increased variability for the expertsurgeon in our study (p = 0.0314). CONCLUSION: Using a novel unilateral 3D-PSGdid not improve the accuracy of screw placement for lumbosacral stabilization by a novice surgeon compared with an expert surgeon in lumbar spine surgery. Thismay reflect a suboptimal PSG design.

TI  - Blood biomarkers for canine cancer, from human to veterinary oncology.
LID - 10.1111/vco.12848 [doi]
AB  - In recent decades, interest in circulating tumour biomarkers is increasing bothin human and veterinary oncology. An ideal tumour biomarker would allow earlydiagnosis of neoplasia, identify it specifically, accurately, establish aprognosis and predict its behaviour, especially regarding different therapeuticsolutions. It would also allow to monitor its evolution over time and all this ina non-invasive and inexpensive way. Actually, no biomarkers meeting all of these criteria have been identified in veterinary medicine, particularly due to a lack of specificity of the main protein tumour biomarkers studied to date. However,great hope is currently placed in biomarkers grouped under the name of liquidbiopsy, which could prove to be effective tools for common clinical use in thenear future. This review gives an update on blood cancer biomarkers studied indogs, such as ions, proteins, nucleic acids and also circulating cells, of which some might become more prominent in the coming years to help improve themanagement of animal care.

AB  - Pasteurella multocida is a small facultative anaerobic Gram-negativecoccobacillus. Bites or scratches from cats or dogs are common transmission routecausing zoonotic infections in humans. The pathogen rarely cause prosthetic jointinfection. We report the first case, to our knowledge, of a prosthetic jointinfection in a patient underwent liver transplantation caused by this pathogen.Pasteurella multocida is a high pace growing pathogen. Physician should raiseawareness with related history especially in patients with immunosuppressivestatus. Management with the proper antibiotics administration in conjunction withtimely surgical intervention could prevent devastating complications and preservethe artificial joint.

TI  - Asymmetrical intraguild interactions with coyotes, red foxes, and domestic dogsmay contribute to competitive exclusion of declining gray foxes.
PG  - e9074
LID - 10.1002/ece3.9074 [doi]
AB  - Species coexistence is governed by availability of resources and intraguildinteractions including strategies to reduce ecological overlap. Gray foxes aredietary generalist mesopredators expected to benefit from anthropogenicdisturbance, but populations have declined across the midwestern USA, includingsevere local extirpation rates coinciding with high coyote and domestic dogoccurrence and low red fox occurrence. We used data from a large-scale cameratrap survey in southern Illinois, USA to quantify intraguild spatial and temporalinteractions among the canid guild including domestic dogs. We used a two-speciesco-occurrence model to make pairwise assessments of conditional occupancy anddetection rates. We also estimated temporal activity overlap among species andfit a fixed-effects hierarchical community occupancy model with the four canidspecies. We partitioned the posterior distributions to compare gray fox occupancyprobabilities conditional on estimated state of combinations of other species to assess support for hypothesized interactions. We found no evidence of broadscale avoidance among native canids and conclude that spatial and temporal segregation were limited by ubiquitous human disturbance. Mean guild richness was two canidspecies at a site and gray fox occupancy was greater when any combination ofsympatric canids was also present, setting the stage for competitive exclusionover time. Domestic dogs may amplify competitive interactions by increasing canidguild size to the detriment of gray foxes. Our results suggest that while humanactivities can benefit some mesopredators, other species such as gray foxes mayserve as bellwethers for habitat degradation with trophic downgrading andcontinued anthropogenic homogenization.

TI  - The Impact of Incorporating Multiple Best Practices on Live Outcomes for aMunicipal Animal Shelter in Memphis, TN.
PG  - 786866
LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.786866 [doi]
AB  - Modern animal shelters are encouraged to adopt "best practices" intended topromote life-saving for the animals that enter their systems. While these bestpractices have been defined and widely promoted within the profession, fewstudies have tracked how making the recommended changes affects live releaserates (LRR) and other shelter metrics. In 2017, the municipal animal shelter inMemphis, TN (Memphis Animal Services) implemented five new strategies andanalyzed their resultant life-saving data. The interventions included managedstrategic shelter intake, pet owner safety net, community cat return to field,transition of field services from punitive to assistive, and streamlined adoptionand transfer protocols. The median LRR for cats prior to 2017 was 35% (IQR 22,36). After the intervention, the LRR increased to a median of 92% (IQR 92, 94).The correlation between intake and euthanasia for cats prior to the intervention was significant (P < 0.001) and very strong (r = 0.982), while after there was norelationship (-0.165) and it was not significant (P = 0.791). The median LRR for dogs prior to 2017 was 25% (IQR 19, 48). After the intervention, the LRRincreased to a median of 87% (IQR 86, 88). The correlation between intake andeuthanasia for dogs prior to the intervention was significant (P < 0.001) andvery strong (r = 0.991), while after there was a moderate relationship (-0.643)that was not significant (P = 0.242). The median LRR for kittens prior to 2017was 34% (IQR 23, 38), which increased (P = 0.001) to 92% (IQR 91, 92) afterintervention. The percent of kittens entering the shelter with an outcome ofeuthanasia decreased (P < 0.001), from a median of 59% (IQR 54, 73) to a medianof 3% (IQR 1, 3). The median return to owner (RTO) rate for dogs increased (P =0.007) from 10% (IQR 9, 11) to 13% (IQR 13, 13). Implementation of these bestpractices accelerated Memphis Animal Services' progress toward a live releaserate of at least 90%, particularly for cats, dramatically decreased kitteneuthanasia, increased the RTO rate for dogs and severed the historicalcorrelation between euthanasia and intake.

PG  - 843390
LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.843390 [doi]
AB  - Epidemiological studies enable us to analyze disease behavior, define riskfactors, and establish fundamental prognostic criteria. This study aimed todetermine the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of canine tumorsdiagnosed during the years 2017-2021. The results showed that canine mammarytumors were the most common tumors, and their relative incidence for5-years-total was 46.71% (504/1,079), with 48.41% (244/504) of benign, and 51.59%(260/504) of malignant. Pure breeds accounted for 84.13% (424/504) ofsubmissions, and adult female dogs (9-12 years old) were most frequentlyinvolved, followed by 5-8-year-old females. Remarkably, 2.58% (13/504) occurredin the male dogs. In addition, a high prevalence of mammary tumors (77.38%,390/504) was diagnosed in unneutered dogs, and different incidence rates wereobserved in different regions (Northeast, Southeast, Northwest and SouthwestChina). For clinical factors, the tumor size ranged from 0.5 to 28 cm, with the0-5 cm being the most common tumor size (47.82%, 241/504), and malignant tumors(4.33 +/- 2.88 cm, mean +/- SD) were bigger than benign ones (3.06 +/- 1.67 cm,mean +/- SD) (p < 0.001). The incidence of single tumor (55.36%, 279/504) washigher than that of multiple tumors in dogs, while the latter had a higherincidence of malignant tumors (74.67%, 168/225). According to this study, we alsofound that canine mammary tumors were more common in the last two pairs ofmammary glands. In addition, multiple linear regression analysis showed thatthere was linear significant relationship between three independent variables(age, tumor size, and tumor number) and histological properties of canine mammarytumor [(p>|t|) < 0.05]. This is the first retrospective statistical analysis ofsuch a large dataset in China to reveal the link between epidemiological clinicalrisks and histological diagnosis. It aids in the improvement of the host'sknowledge of canine tumor disorders and the early prevention of canine mammarytumors.

AB  - Biomarker discovery using biobank samples collected from veterinary clinics woulddeliver insights into the diverse population of pets and accelerate diagnosticdevelopment. The acquisition, preparation, processing, and storage of biofluidsamples in sufficient volumes and at a quality suitable for later analysis withmost suitable discovery methods remain challenging. Metabolomics analysis is avaluable approach to detect health/disease phenotypes. Pre-processing changesduring preparation of plasma/serum samples may induce variability that may beovercome using dried blood spots (DBSs). We report a proof of principle study by metabolite fingerprinting applying UHPLC-MS of plasma and DBSs acquired fromhealthy adult dogs and cats (age range 1-9 years), representing each of 4 dogbreeds (Labrador retriever, Beagle, Petit Basset Griffon Vendeen, and Norfolkterrier) and the British domestic shorthair cat (n = 10 per group). Blood samples(20 and 40 muL) for DBSs were loaded onto filter paper, air-dried at roomtemperature (3 h), and sealed and stored (4 degrees C for ~72 h) prior to storageat -80 degrees C. Plasma from the same blood draw (250 muL) was prepared andstored at -80 degrees C within 1 h of sampling. Metabolite fingerprinting of the DBSs and plasma produced similar numbers of metabolite features that had similar abilities to discriminate between biological classes and correctly assign blindedsamples. These provide evidence that DBSs, sampled in a manner amenable toapplication in in-clinic/in-field processing, are a suitable sample for biomarkerdiscovery using UHPLC-MS metabolomics. Further, given appropriate owner consent, the volumes tested (20-40 muL) make the acquisition of remnant blood from bloodsamples drawn for other reasons available for biobanking and other researchactivities. Together, this makes possible large-scale biobanking of veterinarysamples, gaining sufficient material sooner and enabling quicker identificationof biomarkers of interest.

AB  - The Japanese Veterinary Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (JVARM) wasestablished for nationwide monitoring of antimicrobial-resistant bacteriaisolated from animals. Here, antimicrobial resistance of Escherichia coli andEnterococcus spp. isolates from diseased and healthy dogs and cats wasinvestigated. Isolates were collected from diseased dogs and cats and fromhealthy dogs and cats in 2018 to 2020. Minimum inhibitory concentrations weredetermined for 1873 E. coli and 1383 Enterococcus spp. isolates. E. coli isolateswere most commonly resistant to nalidixic acid [diseased dog (DD), 62.1%;diseased cat (DC), 59.9%; healthy dog (HD), 23.5%; healthy cat (HC, 24.0%] andampicillin (DD, 54.4%; DC, 64.1%; HD, 28.4%; HC, 25.2%), followed byciprofloxacin (DD, 45.0%; DC, 44.0%; HD, 12.9%; HC, 10.4%). Enterococcus spp.isolates were most resistant to tetracycline (DD, 66.9%; DC, 67.8%; HD, 47.0%;HC, 52.0%), followed by erythromycin (DD, 43.2%; DC, 46.6%; HD, 27.8%; HC, 34.0%)and ciprofloxacin (DD, 27.9%; DC, 43.7%; HD, 9.7%; HC 12.9%). Only a few E. coli isolates were resistant to colistin and none were resistant to meropenem. Also,none of the Enterococcus spp. isolates we have tested were resistant tovancomycin. The significantly higher resistance rates of E. coli and Enterococcusspp. isolates from diseased, as opposed to healthy, dogs and cats against most ofthe tested antimicrobials indicates that the use of antimicrobials could selectresistant E. coli and Enterococcus spp.

AB  - Introduction: Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is one of the most commonheart diseases in dogs, and there is a dearth of reports that have investigatedreference values for left ventricular end-diastolic internal diameter correctedfor body weight (LVIDDN) exclusively in toy breeds. Animals: Eighty-sixclient-owned healthy dogs weighing <5 kg, including Toy Poodles, Chihuahuas,Yorkshire Terriers, Papillon, and other small breeds or small mixed breeds (mixedbreed, Pomeranian, dachshund, Shih Tzu, and Maltese). In this retrospectivesingle-center study, data were collected from dogs attending clinic for annualcheckup between April 2014 and March 2021. Materials and Methods: Experiencedechocardiographers performed transthoracic echocardiography, with referenceranges established using healthy dogs. Measurements of body weight (BW), heartrate, and several echocardiographic variables were obtained. The associationbetween BW and echocardiographic parameters was assessed by linear regressionanalyses. M-mode measurements were obtained and normalized using equationsdeveloped from the regression analyses. Results: The LVIDDN value for 95% of dogsweighing <5 kg was achieved by dividing the M-mode measurement by BW raised tothe power 0.332. The upper limit of the prediction interval for breeds weighing<5 kg was much lower than the value currently applied. Conclusions: We propose a reference LVIDDN value of >/=1.6 for the diagnosis of stage B2 MMVD in toy breed dogs. The results of our study will guide clinicians in deciding when to starttreatment for MMVD in small breed dogs.

TI  - Dogs as a Natural Animal Model of Epilepsy.
PG  - 928009
LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.928009 [doi]
AB  - Epilepsy is a common neurological disease in both humans and domestic dogs,making dogs an ideal translational model of epilepsy. In both species, epilepsyis a complex brain disease characterized by an enduring predisposition togenerate spontaneous recurrent epileptic seizures. Furthermore, as in humans,status epilepticus is one of the more common neurological emergencies in dogswith epilepsy. In both species, epilepsy is not a single disease but a group ofdisorders characterized by a broad array of clinical signs, age of onset, andunderlying causes. Brain imaging suggests that the limbic system, including thehippocampus and cingulate gyrus, is often affected in canine epilepsy, whichcould explain the high incidence of comorbid behavioral problems such as anxiety and cognitive alterations. Resistance to antiseizure medications is a significantproblem in both canine and human epilepsy, so dogs can be used to studymechanisms of drug resistance and develop novel therapeutic strategies to benefitboth species. Importantly, dogs are large enough to accommodate intracranial EEG and responsive neurostimulation devices designed for humans. Studies in epilepticdogs with such devices have reported ictal and interictal events that areremarkably similar to those occurring in human epilepsy. Continuous (24/7) EEGrecordings in a select group of epileptic dogs for >1 year have provided a richdataset of unprecedented length for studying seizure periodicities and developingnew methods for seizure forecasting. The data presented in this reviewsubstantiate that canine epilepsy is an excellent translational model for severalfacets of epilepsy research. Furthermore, several techniques of inducing seizuresin laboratory dogs are discussed as related to therapeutic advances. Importantly,the development of vagus nerve stimulation as a novel therapy for drug-resistant epilepsy in people was based on a series of studies in dogs with inducedseizures. Dogs with naturally occurring or induced seizures provide excellentlarge-animal models to bridge the translational gap between rodents and humans inthe development of novel therapies. Furthermore, because the dog is not only apreclinical species for human medicine but also a potential patient and pet,research on this species serves both veterinary and human medicine.

AB  - Traditional methods of data analysis in animal behavior research are usuallybased on measuring behavior by manually coding a set of chosen behavioralparameters, which is naturally prone to human bias and error, and is also atedious labor-intensive task. Machine learning techniques are increasinglyapplied to support researchers in this field, mostly in a supervised manner: for tracking animals, detecting land marks or recognizing actions. Unsupervisedmethods are increasingly used, but are under-explored in the context of behavior studies and applied contexts such as behavioral testing of dogs. This studyexplores the potential of unsupervised approaches such as clustering for theautomated discovery of patterns in data which have potential behavioral meaning. We aim to demonstrate that such patterns can be useful at exploratory stages ofdata analysis before forming specific hypotheses. To this end, we propose aconcrete method for grouping video trials of behavioral testing of animalindividuals into clusters using a set of potentially relevant features. Using an example of protocol for testing in a "Stranger Test", we compare the discoveredclusters against the C-BARQ owner-based questionnaire, which is commonly used fordog behavioral trait assessment, showing that our method separated well betweendogs with higher C-BARQ scores for stranger fear, and those with lower scores.This demonstrates potential use of such clustering approach for exploration priorto hypothesis forming and testing in behavioral research.

AB  - New and creative approaches are required to treat chronic infections caused byincreasingly drug-resistant strains of bacteria. One strategy is the use ofcellular therapy employing mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) to kill bacteriadirectly and to also activate effective host immunity to infection. Wedemonstrated previously that activated MSC delivered systemically could be usedeffectively together with antibiotic therapy to clear chronic biofilm infections in rodent models. Therefore, we sought in the current studies to gain newinsights into the antimicrobial properties of activated canine MSC and toevaluate their effectiveness as a novel cellular therapy for treatment ofnaturally-occurring drug resistant infections in dogs. These studies revealedthat canine MSC produce and secrete antimicrobial peptides that synergize withmost classes of common antibiotics to trigger rapid bactericidal activity. Inaddition, activated canine MSC migrated more efficiently to inflammatory stimuli,and secreted factors associated with wound healing and fibroblast proliferationand recruitment of activated neutrophils. Macrophages incubated with conditioned medium from activated MSC developed significantly enhanced bactericidal activity.Clinical studies in dogs with chronic multidrug resistant infections treated byrepeated i.v. delivery of activated, allogeneic MSC demonstrated significantclinical benefit, including infection clearance and healing of infected tissues. Taken together, the results of these studies provide new insights intoantimicrobial activity of canine MSC, and their potential clinical utility formanagement of chronic, drug-resistant infections.

TI  - Persistent Coronary Vasomotor Tone During Myocardial Ischemia Occurs at theCapillary Level and May Involve Pericytes.
PG  - 930492
LID - 10.3389/fcvm.2022.930492 [doi]
AB  - Background: There is persistent coronary vasomotor tone during myocardialischemia, despite ongoing coronary arteriolar dilatation. The mechanismunderlying this vasodilatory tone, which can be unmasked by coronaryvasodilators, is unclear. We hypothesized that persistent microvascularresistance during myocardial ischemia occurs at the level of capillaries and may be caused by pericytes. Methods: We studied nine instrumented dogs where coronaryblood flow and coronary driving pressure were reduced to half by placement ofstenoses. Myocardial blood flow and myocardial blood volume were measured withmyocardial contrast echocardiography before and during adenosine administration. In three animals, the heart was perfusion-fixed under these conditions forelectron microscopic assessment of capillary and pericyte size. Results: Duringischemia, myocardial blood volume decreased and myocardial vascular resistanceremained unchanged. Adenosine administration reversed the decline in myocardialblood volume and decreased myocardial vascular resistance. Electron microscopyshowed larger capillaries in ischemic beds receiving adenosine than ischemic bedsnot receiving adenosine. Pericytes in beds receiving adenosine also tended to be larger. Conclusion: Capillaries are the site of persistent vasomotor tone during myocardial ischemia; any other site of vascular regulation (arterioles orvenules) cannot explain these myocardial contrast echocardiography findings,which are confirmed on post-mortem electron microscopic examination. The decreasein capillary size is likely caused by pericyte contraction in an attempt tomaintain a constant capillary hydrostatic pressure. Adenosine relaxes pericytes, restores myocardial blood volume, reduces myocardial vascular resistance, andimproves regional function during ischemia. These findings could have importanttherapeutic implications.

AB  - Visceral leishmaniasis is an important global health problem with an estimated of50,000 to 90,000 new cases per year. VL is the most serious form of leishmaniasisas it can be fatal in 95% of the cases if it remains untreated. VL is aparticularly acute problem in Brazil which contributed with 97% of all casesreported in 2020 in the Americas. In this country, VL affects mainly the poorest people in both urban and rural areas and continues to have a high mortality rate estimated around 8.15%. Here, we performed a temporal parasite population studyusing whole genome sequence data from a set of 34 canine isolates sampled in2008, 2012 and 2015 from a re-emergent focus in Southeastern Brazil. Our studyfound the presence of two distinct sexual subpopulations that corresponded to twoisolation periods. These subpopulations diverged hundreds of years ago with noapparent gene flow between them suggesting a process of rapid replacement during a two-year period. Sequence comparisons and analysis of nucleotide diversity alsoshowed evidence of balancing selection acting on transport-related genes andantigenic families. To our knowledge this is the first population genomic studyshowing a turn-over of parasite populations in an endemic region forleishmaniasis. The complexity and rapid adaptability of these parasites pose new challenges to control activities and demand more integrated approaches tounderstand this disease in New World foci.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment of Malassezia pachydermatis dermatitis can be performed by systemic or topical route. As M. pachydermatis is located on the stratum corneum,topical therapy alone may be sufficient to resolve the infection. Owing tosystemic antifungal resistance and adverse effects, topical treatment alone mayimprove treatment outcome. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of atopical spray composed of Sodium Benzoate, alcohol and botanical oils, comparedto a shampoo containing 2% chlorhexidine gluconate and 2% miconazole nitrate for the treatment of Malassezia pachydermaitis dermatitis in dogs. ANIMALS: Sixteenclient owned dogs diagnosed with symmetrical interdigital lesions as a result of secondary Malassezia dermatitis. METHODS: The study design was prospective,randomised and single-blinded, using a split body protocol. Malassezia yeastswere determined by cytology at the inclusion day (day0) and after treatment(day14). All dogs were treated during 14 days with both shampoo at one paw andspray on the other paw. RESULTS: At day 14 a reduction of Malassezia dermatitiswas shown at both paws. No statistical difference was demonstrated betweentreatment with shampoo or spray. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: We couldnot show a difference in efficacy between application of the test spray oncedaily and the topical use of 2%miconazole/2%chlorhexidine shampoo every otherday. No adverse effects were reported.

TI  - Evaluation of presentation, treatment and outcome in hypertensive emergency indogs and cats: 15 cases (2003-2019).
LID - 10.1111/jsap.13530 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Hypertensive emergency is well recognised in human medicine, yetthere is limited veterinary evidence. This study aimed to determine thepresentation, treatment and outcome in dogs and cats with hypertensive emergency.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective case series of dogs and cats withhypertensive emergency identified as follows: acute history with non-invasiveDoppler systolic blood pressure greater than 180 mmHg and target organ damageincluding acute onset seizures, altered mentation with or without lateralrecumbency or blindness. Data collected included signalment, history, physicalexamination and clinicopathological findings, systolic blood pressure,antihypertensive treatment and outcome. RESULTS: Seven dogs and eight cats wereincluded presenting with seizures (n=9), blindness (n=4), altered mentation with (n=2) or without (n=2) lateral recumbency. Median age was 9 years (range 1 to 15)and duration of clinical signs before presentation was 1.5 days (range 1 to 15). Median systolic blood pressure on presentation was 230 mmHg (range 190 to 300).Amlodipine was the most common first-line agent (n=10), followed by hydralazine(n=4) and hypertonic saline (n=1). Aetiology of hypertensive emergency was acute kidney injury (n=9), idiopathic hypertension (n=3), hyperthyroidism (n=1),lymphoma (n=1) and suspected cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy (n=1).Five cats and three dogs survived to discharge with an overall survival of 53.3%.CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Hypertensive emergencies had various presenting signs inthis series. AKI was considered to be the cause of hypertension in the majorityof patients. Further evaluation of treatment for hypertensive emergencies iswarranted, considering almost half of the cases did not survive to discharge.

AB  - Most small diameter vascular grafts (inner diameter<6 mm) evaluation studies are performed in healthy animals that cannot represent the clinical situation.Herein, an hypercholesterolemia (HC) rat model with thickened intima and elevatedexpression of pro-inflammatory intercellular adhesion molecular-1 (ICAM-1) in thecarotid branch is established. Electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) vascular grafts(length: 1 cm; inner diameter: 2 mm) are implanted into the HC rat abdominalaortas in an end to end fashion and followed up to 43 days, showing a relativelower patency accompanied by significant neointima hyperplasia, abundant collagendeposition, and slower endothelialization than those implanted into healthy ones.Moreover, the proliferation, migration, and adhesion behavior of endothelialcells (ECs) isolated from the HC aortas are impaired as evaluated under bothstatic and pulsatile flow conditions. DNA microarray studies of the HC aorticendothelium suggest genes involved in EC proliferation (Egr2), apoptosis (Zbtb16 and Mt1), and metabolism (Slc7a11 and Hamp) are down regulated. These resultssuggest the impaired proliferative, migratory, and adhesive abilities of ECs are associated with the bad performances of grafts in HC rat. Future pre-clinicalevaluation of small diameter vascular grafts may concern more disease animalmodels with clinical complications. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: During thedevelopment of small diameter vascular grafts (D<6 mm), young and healthy animal models from pigs, sheep, dogs, to rabbits and rats are preferred. However, itcannot represent the clinic situation, where most cardiovascular graftingprocedures are performed in the elderly and age is the primary risk factor fordisease development or death. Herein, the performance of electrospunpolycaprolactone (PCL) vascular grafts implanted into hypercholesterolemia (HC)or healthy rats were evaluated. Results suggest the proliferative, migratory, andadhesive abilities of endothelial cells (ECs) are already impaired in HC rats,which contributes to the observed slower endothelialization of implanted PCLgrafts. Future pre-clinical evaluation of small diameter vascular grafts mayconcern more disease animal models with clinical complications.

AB  - Canine leishmaniasis is increasingly reported worldwide and represent a threat toboth animal and human health. In a previous pilot study conducted inBobo-Dioulasso, the second town of Burkina Faso, we reported five cases of canineleishmaniasis. With the perspective of a One Health action plan, and in thecontext of increasing urbanization, this study aimed to provide new informationon Leishmania spp in dogs in this city. A cross-sectional survey was carried out from May to August 2018 in six districts of the city in order to record clinical and biological data from domestic dogs randomly selected per district. Bloodsamples were collected into EDTA tubes (4-5 mL), treated and stored at -20degrees C until further analyses. The infection status of the dogs was performed by serological tests using plasma, and real time-PCR (RT-PCR) to detectLeishmania parasites using buffy coats. Nested PCR was used for typing theLeishmania species in dogs which were found to be RT-PCR positive. A total of 147dogs were examined clinically and sampled for blood collection, including 53.7%females and 46.3% of males with a median age of 3 years. The seroincidence ofLeishmania parasites within this dog population was 4.76% (95% CI:2.26-9.72). Theincidence of Leishmania was 10.88% (95% CI: 6.73-17.11) by RT-PCR which wassignificantly more sensitive (p = 0,047) and a fair concordance was observedbetween both tests (Kappa = 0.39, p < 0.001). The characterization of Leishmania species revealed that L. major was circulating in this domestic dog population.Our results confirmed the persistence of zoonotic circulation of Leishmaniaparasites such as L. major currently in Bobo-Dioulasso city and highlight theneed for targeted interventions in order to control transmission of leishmaniasisin this region.

TI  - Viscum album L., a therapeutic option for neoplastic diseases in companionanimals? A systematic review.
LID - 10.1159/000525035 [doi]
AB  - Cancer is a common disease in humans and in companion animals and treatment ischallenging. The aim of this systematic review was to identify and assess thepotential use of Viscum album L. extracts (VAE) for treatment of neoplasticdiseases in companion animals. Peer-reviewed animal, in vivo and in vitro studieswere included, considering the preferred reporting items for systematic reviewsand meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement and a measurement tool to assess systematic reviews (AMSTAR). Overall, 6,148 references were identified. Following apredefined protocol, 114 full-text references were assessed. Ultimately, 61references were included for further assessment, 25 references included in vitro experiments, 26 included in vivo and clinical experiments and 10 referencesincluded both in vitro and in vivo experiments. These 61 references compriseddata of 193 in vitro and 67 in vivo and clinical experiments. Most of the 67 invivo and clinical experiments were conducted with mice (59), followed by rats(4), dogs (3) and horses (1). So far, oral melanomas, mammary tumors and sticker sarcomas in dogs, as well as sarcoids in horses, have been investigated incontrolled clinical trials. A scoring system was established to evaluate theoutcomes of each study based on defined effect levels. The efficacy of VAEtreatment was most pronounced for melanomas, sarcomas, mammary carcinoma andequine sarcoids. The limited number and quality of published studies on VAEtreatment in companion animals impedes to draw definitive conclusions regardingthe efficacy of VAE in the treatment of cancer. Thus, further research is needed to elucidate the impact of VAE on the treatment of cancer in companion animalsand possible underlying mechanisms.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Surgical mitral valve repair is a possible option for dogs withmyxomatous mitral valve disease. However, information on surgical results andpostoperative echocardiography is limited. This study aimed to verify thestage-specific surgical results of mitral valve repair and postoperativeechocardiographic changes for two years following surgery. ANIMALS: Adult dogs (n= 55) treated with surgical mitral valve repair using the loop-in-loop technique were included in this study. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed.RESULTS: Ninety percent of cases (50/55) survived to discharge, which survivalwas significantly decreased in myxomatous mitral valve disease advanced-stagedogs, Stage B2 (n = 14): 100%, Stage C (n = 27): 96.2%, and Stage D (n = 14):71.4%. Significant reductions of overall heart size (vertebral heart score:preoperative 11.4 vs. post 1 month 10.2, P < 0.001), left atrium (left atrium to aortic root ratio: preoperative 2.3 vs. post 1 month 1.5, P < 0.001) and leftventricle (left ventricular end-diastolic diameter [normalized for bodyweight]:preoperative 2.2 vs. post 1 month 1.5, P < 0.001) were documented one month aftersurgery, showing successful management of mitral regurgitation. All medicationsfor mitral valve disease were discontinued 3 months after surgery. The recurrenceof mitral regurgitation was not evident during the two-year follow-up period.CONCLUSIONS: Surgical mitral valve repair with the loop-in-loop technique isassociated with significant decreases in indices of cardiac size at 1-monthpost-repair. Disease stage influences operative survival after surgical mitralvalve repair.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report on transvenous detachable coiling in small dogs deemedineligible for traditional transarterial patent ductus arteriosus occlusion andcompare transthoracic echocardiographic and angiographic measurements todetermine their equivalence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of 35dogs that underwent transvenous coiling of a patent ductus arteriosus.Demographic information, echocardiographic and angiographic studies, surgeryreports, and follow-up evaluation of residual flow were obtained. A Bland-Altman analysis was used to compare echocardiographic and angiographic measurements ofthe minimal ductal diameter (Echo-MDD, Ang-MDD) and ampulla diameter (Echo-A,Ang-A). RESULTS: Thirty-four of 35 dogs had successful deployment of a coil, withone dog undergoing occlusion with a different device after the exteriorized coil pulled through the ductus. Complete occlusion was achieved in 18 dogs within 24h; four dogs were lost to follow-up, and the remaining 12 dogs had no residualflow or a significant reduction in shunting with normalization in cardiac chamberdimensions by a median of 99 days. Thirty percent of dogs (11/35) experiencedperioperative complications of which 10 were minor complications. The analysis of26 dogs with both echocardiographic and angiographic ductal measurements showed a-0.14 mm mean difference (95% limits of agreement -1.08 to 0.8 mm) in minimalductal diameter and -0.68 mm mean difference (95% limits of agreement -2.73 to1.37 mm) in ampulla diameter. CONCLUSIONS: Dogs less than 3 kg deemed too smallfor transarterial occlusion can successfully undergo transvenous coilembolization of patent ductus arteriosus.

AB  - As tick-borne diseases continue to increase across North America, currentresearch strives to understand how the tick microbiome may affect pathogenacquisition, maintenance, and transmission. Prior high throughput amplicon-based microbial diversity surveys of the widespread tick Dermacentor variabilis havesuggested that life stage, sex, and geographic region may influence thecomposition of the tick microbiome. Here, adult D. variabilis ticks (n = 145)were collected from dogs and cats from 32 states with specimens originating from all four regions of the United States (West, Midwest, South, and Northeast), and the tick microbiome was examined via V4-16S rRNA gene amplification and Illumina sequencing. A total of 481,246 bacterial sequences were obtained (median 2924 persample, range 399-11,990). Fifty genera represented the majority (>80%) of thesequences detected, with the genera Allofrancisella and Francisella being themost abundant. Further, 97%, 23%, and 5.5% of the ticks contained sequencesbelonging to Francisella spp., Rickettsia spp., and Coxiella spp., respectively. No Ehrlichia spp. or Anaplasma spp. were identified. Co-occurrence analysis, byway of correlation coefficients, between the top 50 most abundant generademonstrated five strong positive and no strong negative correlationrelationships. Geographic region had a consistent effect on species richness withticks from the Northeast having a significantly greater level of richness. Alpha diversity patterns were dependent on tick sex, with males exhibiting higherlevels of diversity, and geographical region, with higher level of diversityobserved in ticks obtained from the Northeast, but not on tick host. Communitystructure, or beta diversity, of tick microbiome was impacted by tick sex andgeographic location, with microbiomes of ticks from the western US exhibiting adistinct community structure when compared to those from the other three regions (Northeast, South, and Midwest). In total, LEfSe (Linear discriminant analysisEffect Size) identified 18 specific genera driving these observed patterns ofdiversity and community structure. Collectively, these findings highlight thedifferences in bacterial diversity of D. variabilis across the US and supportsthe interpretation that tick sex and geographic region affects microbiomecomposition across a broad sampling distribution.

AB  - Pericardial effusions in dogs are most often diagnosed as haemorrhagic andidiopathic. Pericardial effusions secondary to an underlying neoplastic processare infrequently diagnosed, as neoplastic cells are rarely observed in a sampleof the effusion. In the present report, we describe a 9-year-old dog withpericardial effusion due to T-cell lymphoma of granular lymphocyte type.Immunophenotyping and molecular clonality PCR were performed to confirm thecytologic diagnosis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of pericardialeffusion in a dog due to T-cell lymphoma of granular lymphocyte type.

AB  - Canine pituitary-dependent hypercortisolism (PDH) management with trilostaneusually demands lifelong therapy. The greater the dose needed, the greater therisk of side effects. Selegiline therapy has been previously described but notcommonly used for PDH treatment. The present work aimed to assess the efficacy ofselegiline and trilostane combined therapy for canine PDH treatment. Fifteenclient-owned dogs diagnosed with spontaneous PDH were enrolled. The patients weretreated with trilostane (Tri group, n = 8, initial dose of 0.5 mg/kg, PO, q12h), or with trilostane and selegiline (Tri + Sel group, n = 7, initial trilostanedose of 0.5 mg/kg, PO, q12h and selegiline 1 mg/kg, PO, q24h). Dogs underwentclinical examination, serum biochemical analysis, urinalysis, abdominalultrasound, and eACTH and post-ACTH cortisol measurements on treatment days zero (D0), 30 (D30), 90 (D90), and 180 (D180). There was a lack of adverse effects dueto the combined therapy. Both groups showed a similar clinical response and lowerpost-ACTH cortisol levels at the study's end. There was no significant differencein trilostane dosage at D180 between groups. There was no documented increase in either right or left adrenal gland thickness in the Tri + Sel group in contrastwith patients in the Tri group. However, there was no statistical differencebetween the groups regarding eACTH at D0 and D180. Patients in the Tri + Selgroup achieved better serum triglycerides control at the end of the study. Theassociation of selegiline with trilostane might be a feasible therapy for canine PDH; however, its eventual advantages need larger studies.

AB  - INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVE: The T wave is a poorly characterized electrocardiographicvariable in small animals. Therefore, this study aimed to describe T wavefeatures in a large population of healthy dogs. ANIMALS, MATERIALS, AND METHODS: Medical records were reviewed to identify healthy dogs >/=one-year-olds thatunderwent an electrocardiogram. T wave qualitative (morphology, polarity, andconcordance between R and T waves) and quantitative (duration, amplitude, meanelectrical axis, ratio between T and R waves amplitudes, interval from the peakto the end of the T wave, and ratio between the duration of the latter intervaland that of the QT) variables were evaluated. Continuous and categoricalvariables were compared between dogs of distinct sex, body weight (BW), age andsomatotype using the Mann-Whitney U test and chi(2) test, respectively.Spearman's correlation coefficients between quantitative variables and age and BWwere calculated. Reference intervals of quantitative variables were determined inthe overall population. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-nine dogs were enrolled. Concerning morphology, the asymmetrical (slow/fast) pattern occurred morefrequently than the symmetrical and biphasic ones. Concerning polarity, positive T waves occurred more frequently than negative and neutral ones. T and R waveswere predominantly concordant. No meaningful differences were found whencomparing qualitative and quantitative variables between dogs of distinct sex,BW, age and somatotype. No significant correlations were found betweenquantitative variables and age and BW. Reference intervals of quantitativevariables are provided. CONCLUSIONS: Canine T wave features were addressed andstatistically reliable reference intervals made available for clinical use.

TI  - Evaluation of quick sequential organ failure scores in dogs with severe sepsisand septic shock.
LID - 10.1111/jsap.13522 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prognostic utility of the quick sequential organfailure assessment score in dogs with severe sepsis and septic shock presentingto an emergency service, and evaluate the clinical value of the quick sequential organ failure assessment score to predict severe sepsis and septic shock.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The quick sequential organ failure assessment score wascalculated by evaluating respiratory rate (>22 breaths per minute), arterialsystolic blood pressure (</=100 mmHg) and altered mentation. The quick sequentialorgan failure assessment scores with respiratory rate cut-offs of greater than22, greater than 30 and greater than 40 were compared. Cases were defined as dogspresented to the emergency room and met at least 2 systemic inflammatory responsesyndrome criteria, had documented infection, and at least one organ dysfunction. A control population of dogs included animals with non-infectious systemicinflammatory response syndrome. RESULTS: Forty-five dogs with severe sepsis andseptic shock and 45 dogs with non-infectious systemic inflammatory responsesyndrome were included in the final analysis. The quick sequential organ failure assessment provided poor discrimination between survivors and non-survivors forsevere sepsis and septic shock (area under receiving operating characteristiccurve, 0.51; 95% confidence interval, 0.35 to 0.67). Discrimination remained poorwhen quick sequential organ failure assessment greater than 30 and quicksequential organ failure assessment greater than 40 scores were calculated (area under receiving operating characteristic curve, 0.56; 95% confidence interval,0.39 to 0.72, and 0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.36 to 0.71). The quicksequential organ failure assessment of at least 2, quick sequential organ failureassessment greater than 30 of at least 2 and quick sequential organ failureassessment greater than 40 of at least 2 produced sensitivity and specificity to detect severe sepsis and septic shock of 66.7% and 64.5%, 62.2% and 71.1%, 44.4% and 80%, respectively. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Scoring systemsutilised in emergency rooms should have high sensitivity to reduce missed sepsis cases and treatment delays. The use of the quick sequential organ failureassessment for severe sepsis and septic shock demonstrated poor mortalityprediction and low sensitivity to detect canine patients with severe sepsis andseptic shock and should not be used alone when screening for sepsis.

TI  - Improvement of Left Ventricular Graft Function Using anIron-Chelator-Supplemented Bretschneider Solution in a Canine Model of OrthotopicHeart Transplantation.
LID - 7453 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23137453 [doi]
AB  - Demand for organs is increasing while the number of donors remains constant.Nevertheless, not all organs are utilized due to the limited time window forheart transplantation (HTX). Therefore, we aimed to evaluate whether aniron-chelator-supplemented Bretschneider solution could protect the graft in aclinically relevant canine model of HTX with prolonged ischemic storage. HTX was performed in foxhounds. The ischemic time was standardized to 4 h, 8 h, 12 h or16 h, depending on the experimental group. Left ventricular (LV) and vascularfunction were measured. Additionally, the myocardial high energy phosphate andiron content and the in-vitro myocyte force were evaluated. Iron chelatorsupplementation proved superior at a routine preservation time of 4 h, as well asfor prolonged times of 8 h and longer. The supplementation groups recoveredquickly compared to their controls. The LV function was preserved and coronaryblood flow increased. This was also confirmed by in vitro myocyte force andvasorelaxation experiments. Additionally, the biochemical results showedsignificantly higher adenosine triphosphate content in the supplementationgroups. The iron chelator LK614 played an important role in this mechanism byreducing the chelatable iron content. This study shows that aniron-chelator-supplemented Bretschneider solution effectively preventsmyocardial/endothelial damage during short- as well as long-term conservation.

AB  - Effective child protection systems and processes require reliable and accuratedata. The aim of this study was to determine what data could be extracted fromhospital records in a single site that reflected a child's journey from admissionwith suspected abuse to the decisions regarding substantiation made by themultidisciplinary child protection team. A retrospective study of the caserecords of 452 children referred to a major UK children's tertiary centre forsuspected child maltreatment was undertaken. Child maltreatment was substantiatedin 65% of referred cases, with the majority of referrals coming from childrenliving in the most deprived neighbourhoods in the country. Domestic violence and abuse and the child's previous involvement with statutory bodies were associated with case substantiation. Physical abuse predominated, with soft tissue injuries,including dog bites and burns, most frequent. Burns were related almostexclusively to supervisory neglect. There were also cases of medical neglect.Emotional abuse was associated with exposure to domestic violence and abuse andto self-harm. The strengths and limitations for single-centre data systems wereexplored, concluding with a recommendation to establish an agreed national andinternational minimum data set to protect children from maltreatment.

TI  - Microbial Source Tracking as a Method of Determination of Beach SandContamination.
LID - 7934 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19137934 [doi]
AB  - Beach sand may act as a reservoir for numerous microorganisms, including enteric pathogens. Several of these pathogens originate in human or animal feces, whichmay pose a public health risk. In August 2019, high levels of fecal indicatorbacteria (FIB) were detected in the sand of the Azorean beach Prainha, TerceiraIsland, Portugal. Remediation measures were promptly implemented, including sand removal and the spraying of chlorine to restore the sand quality. To determinethe source of the fecal contamination, during the first campaign, supratidal sandsamples were collected from several sites along the beach, followed by microbial source tracking (MST) analyses of Bacteroides marker genes for five animalspecies, including humans. Some of the sampling sites revealed the presence ofmarker genes from dogs, seagulls, and ruminants. Making use of the information onbiological sources originating partially from dogs, the municipality enforcedrestrictive measures for dog-walking at the beach. Subsequent sampling campaigns detected low FIB contamination due to the mitigation and remediation measuresthat were undertaken. This is the first case study where the MST approach wasused to determine the contamination sources in the supratidal sand of a coastalbeach. Our results show that MST can be an essential tool to determine sources offecal contamination in the sand. This study shows the importance of holisticmanagement of beaches that should go beyond water quality monitoring for FIB,putting forth evidence for beach sand monitoring.

LID - 10.3390/ijerph19137772 [doi]
AB  - Emerging evidence accumulates regarding the benefits of animal-assistedinterventions (AAIs) in facilitating pediatric cancer treatment and alleviatingsymptomatology through positive changes in the patients' emotional, mental, andeven physical status. A major concern expressed by healthcare providers andparents in implementing AAIs in hospital settings is the transmission of disease from animals to patients. Immunocompromised children, such as pediatric cancerpatients are at increased risk for pet-associated diseases. Furthermore, existingdisparities among the racial and ethnic minority groups of pediatric cancerpatients can potentially exacerbate their risk for zoonoses. This literaturereview highlights the most common human infections from therapy animals,connections to the race and ethnic background of pediatric oncology patients, as well as means of prevention. The discussion is limited to dogs, which aretypically the most commonly used species in hospital-based animal-assistedtherapy. The aim is to highlight specific preventive measures, precautions andrecommendations that must be considered in hospitals' protocols and bestpractices, particularly given the plethora of benefits provided by AAI forpediatric cancer patients, staff and families.

TI  - Is Pet Health Insurance Able to Improve Veterinary Care? Why Pet Health Insurancefor Dogs and Cats Has Limits: An Ethical Consideration on Pet Health Insurance.
LID - 1728 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12131728 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Owners often feel the cost of veterinary care is too high, as thereremains a limited understanding of the cost of health care in human andveterinary medicine alike. Pet health insurance is often seen as a universalsolution. However, especially for patient owners with few financial resources,both the bill at the vet and the monthly premium for pet health insurance canbecome a challenge. HYPOTHESIS: Pet health insurance can prevent or ease manyprice discussions at the vet, but it does not offer a solution for patient ownerswith little financial means. METHODS: In order to verify for which patient ownerspet health insurance can be a solution, four theoretical groups were formeddepending on the patient owner's willingness to pay and his/her dispensable fundsbased on a theoretical model. RESULTS: Dispensable funds are a factor that cannotbe influenced by the veterinary surgeon. However, low dispensable funds as aresult of an insufficient willingness to save (whether due to a lack of financialeducation or a lack of will) can be solved by pet health insurance. Willingnessto pay, on the other hand, can be influenced by empathetic communication from theveterinary surgeon and thus also from pet health insurance. Nevertheless,situations remain where pet health insurance is not a solution either, becauseowners can neither afford the veterinary costs nor a premium for a pet healthinsurance.

TI  - The Role of Dogs in the Relationship between Telework and Performance via Affect:A Moderated Moderated Mediation Analysis.
LID - 1727 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12131727 [doi]
AB  - Although there is evidence that pets may help individuals facing significantdaily stressors, and that they may enhance the well-being of their owners, littleis known about the benefits of pets for job performance. Since the COVID-19pandemic crisis, teleworking was a strategy implemented in many countries toreduce the virus widespread and to assure organizational productivity. Those who work from home and who own pets may work close to them. Based on the conservationof resources theory, this study aimed to analyze whether positive affect mediatedthe relationship between telecommuting and self-reported job performance and ifpsychological and physical closeness to the pet would moderate this relationship in such a way that it would be stronger for those who worked closer to their pet,and who were more emotionally attached to them. For this study, we collected datafrom 81 teleworkers who did not own pets, and from 320 teleworkers who ownedpets. Both answered an online questionnaire. Findings: Results from the studyshowed the existence of significant differences between those who owned and whodid not own pets regarding positive affect and performance, in which those whoowned pets reported higher levels of positive affect and self-reportedperformance and perceived telework more positively. Moreover, positive affectmediated the relationship between telework and self-reported job performance.Furthermore, emotional and physical closeness moderated the mediating effect.This study contributes to a better understanding of the human-animal interaction and how pets can be a personal resource able to change their owners' affectiveexperiences and job performance while they are working from home. The findingsdemonstrate that telework may be a suitable organizational strategy forpet-owners.

TI  - Ground Reaction Forces and Center of Pressure within the Paws When Stepping over Obstacles in Dogs.
LID - 1702 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12131702 [doi]
AB  - Walking over obstacles is a widely used physiotherapy exercise in dogs. Currentresearch is limited to the effect of this exercise in kinematics and muscleactivation in dogs. The present study assessed the influence of walking overobstacles on the ground reaction forces (GRFs) and center of pressure (COP) indogs. Data of dogs walking over one and two obstacles over a pressure platformwere retrospectively analyzed and compared to normal walking. Walking over oneobstacle did not affect the GRFs and COP of the forelimbs; however, significantchanges were observed for the hindlimbs, especially the leading hindlimb. Walkingover two obstacles caused significant changes to only one value at the forelimbs,whereas multiple significant changes in the GRFs and COP values were observed at the hindlimbs. Walking over obstacles seems to be challenging even for healthyadult dogs. Further studies are needed to investigate how different heights ofobstacles and distances between them can further challenge the animals. Thecombination of kinetics and kinematics during walking over obstacles may be used in future as a diagnostic tool in geriatric and neurological patients in order toassess their proprioception awareness or to assess the improvement after anintervention, e.g., physiotherapy treatment.

TI  - Disenfranchised Guilt-Pet Owners' Burden.
LID - 1690 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12131690 [doi]
AB  - Guilt refers to an unpleasant emotional state associated with one's behaviors,thoughts, or intentions, and it is based on the possibility that one may be inthe wrong or that others may have this perception. Parental guilt is one commonsubtype and is often associated with work-family conflict (WFC). WFC and related guilt have been found to be associated with depression and anxiety. Through anonline anonymous survey, the current study was designed to explore dog owners'guilt surrounding their dogs. Results suggest that dog owners' guilt and WFCassociated with their dog are at levels similar to those reported in human familystudies. Additionally, the relationship between dog owners' guilt and discrepancybetween participants' actual and ideal self, in regard to the role of a dogowner, also mirrored human-only family research. Because pet-related guilt isunrecognized, acknowledged, or supported, we suggest it is disenfranchised. Aspeople return to work, in this period of post-COVID-19 pandemic time, it isparamount that companies and communities acknowledge pet owner guilt and WFC and help owners find practical, effective solutions.

LID - 1688 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12131688 [doi]
AB  - Fine needle biopsy (FNB) is an effective, minimally invasive and inexpensivediagnostic technique. Under computed tomography (CT)-guidance, lesions that have a difficult approach can be sampled to reach a diagnosis. The aim of this studyis to describe the use of CT-guidance to obtain FNB from vertebral andparavertebral lesions in small animals. Ten dogs and one ferret that hadundergone CT-guided FNB of vertebral and paravertebral lesions and had acytological or a histological diagnosis were included in this retrospectivestudy. The FNB samples were taken in four cases from the vertebra, in two casesfrom the intervertebral disc and in five cases from the intervertebral foramen.Two infectious and nine neoplastic lesions were diagnosed. The percentage ofsuccessful FNB was 91%. The percentage of samples with a cytological diagnosiswas 80%. The percentage of complications was 9%. Limitations were the smallnumber of animals in the study, the lacking complementary percutaneous biopsiesfor comparison, the lacking final histological diagnoses in some cases and theintervention of multiple operators. Computed tomography-guided FNB is a usefuland safe technique for the diagnosis of vertebral and paravertebral lesions insmall animals. However, a degree of expertise is important.

LID - 10.3390/ani12131684 [doi]
AB  - It is common to observe play in dogs, cats, and birds, but have we been ignoring play in one of the most common house pets of all... fish? Aquarium fish are oftenused as meditative decoration in family households, but it could be that fishhave similarly diverse behavioral repertoires as mammals and birds. To examinethis theory, we conducted field tests at local pet stores where a range ofaquarium fish species was tested for responsiveness to laser pointer stimuli. Outof 66 species of fish tested, over 80% showed a tendency to be interested in the moving laser spots, particularly red ones. Whether this behavior constitutes playis an active topic of investigation that we examine in this work.

TI  - Changes to Adult Dog Social Behaviour during and after COVID-19 Lockdowns inEngland: A Qualitative Analysis of Owner Perception.
LID - 1682 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12131682 [doi]
AB  - Reports suggest that dogs have experienced more quality time with their ownersand have exhibited less separation-related behaviour during COVID-19. This study aims to define and explore the changes in the social behaviour of adult dogs,identify any perceived short- and long-term effects and identify the implicationsthat future events may have due to the implementation and withdrawal of COVID-19 restrictions. Owners of dogs aged between 3 and 6 years living in England wererecruited for semi-structured interviews about their dogs' social behavioursbefore, during and after lockdown. Interviews were transcribed and thematicanalysis was used to identify key themes. Fifteen owners of eighteen dogs wereinterviewed in December 2021 to January 2022. All owners interviewed noticed achange in behaviour either during or following the COVID-19 lockdowns. Manyowners found that fear-related and aggressive behaviours increased, particularly after lockdown restrictions had been lifted. There is a risk to human and animal safety if fear-related behaviours are not properly managed and there is a danger to dog welfare through relinquishment as owners struggle to cope with problematicbehaviours. An increase in the duration of walks is comparable to other studies; however, this study found that many owners continued to walk their dogs more thanrestrictions allowed. Reliable information or behavioural support by qualifiedprofessionals may be needed to aid owners in mitigating the impacts of theCOVID-19 pandemic. Behaviour modification plans or information could includepositive techniques such as desensitisation and counterconditioning. More widely,owners should be prepared for any future behavioural changes due to unpredictableevents which may alter the dog-owner dynamic. Results can be adapted to theincrease in at-home working following the pandemic or other novel experiences andchanges of routine such as retirement, job change or relocation. More awarenessof the long-term implications of the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to prepare dogbehaviour professionals for future owner concerns.

TI  - Genetic Basis of Dilated Cardiomyopathy in Dogs and Its Potential as aBidirectional Model.
LID - 1679 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12131679 [doi]
AB  - Cardiac disease is a leading cause of death for both humans and dogs. Geneticcardiomyopathies, including dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), account for aproportion of these cases in both species. Patients may suffer from ventricularenlargement and systolic dysfunction resulting in congestive heart failure andventricular arrhythmias with high risk for sudden cardiac death. Although canine DCM has similar disease progression and subtypes as in humans, only a fewcandidate genes have been found to be associated with DCM while the geneticbackground of human DCM has been more thoroughly studied. Additionally,experimental disease models using induced pluripotent stem cells have been widelyadopted in the study of human genetic cardiomyopathy but have not yet been fully adapted for the in-depth study of canine genetic cardiomyopathies. The clinicalpresentation of DCM is extremely heterogeneous for both species with differences occurring based on sex predisposition, age of onset, and the rate of diseaseprogression. Both genetic predisposition and environmental factors play a role indisease development which are identical in dogs and humans in contrast to otherexperimental animals. Interestingly, different dog breeds have been shown todevelop distinct DCM phenotypes, and this presents a unique opportunity formodeling as there are multiple breed-specific models for DCM with less geneticvariance than human DCM. A better understanding of DCM in dogs has the potential for improved selection for breeding and could lead to better overall care andtreatment for human and canine DCM patients. At the same time, progress inresearch made for human DCM can have a positive impact on the care given to dogs affected by DCM. Therefore, this review will analyze the feasibility of caninesas a naturally occurring bidirectional disease model for DCM in both species. Thehistopathology of the myocardium in canine DCM will be evaluated in threedifferent breeds compared to control tissue, and the known genetics thatcontributes to both canine and human DCM will be summarized. Lastly, the prospectof canine iPSCs as a novel method to uncover the contributions of geneticvariants to the pathogenesis of canine DCM will be introduced along with theapplications for disease modeling and treatment.

TI  - Refining the APGAR Score Cutoff Values and Viability Classes According to BreedBody Size in Newborn Dogs.
LID - 1664 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12131664 [doi]
AB  - The Apgar score (AS) represents a key tool for neonate assessment, but thepossible breed effect on AS in newborn puppies has never been investigated.Therefore, data from 234 dog litters born by caesarean section, grouped accordingto breed body size (BBS) (small, medium, large), were evaluated. Live-birthpuppies were assessed through AS within 5 min of delivery, and classified inviability classes: 0-3 severely distressed, 4-6 moderately distressed, 7-10 notdistressed. Statistical analysis evaluated possible differences of AS andviability class according to BBS, and between BBS and puppies' mortality. Resultsshowed no differences in the distribution of mortalities among BBSs. However, an effect of BBS on the AS was found, with small-sized puppies being the mostrepresented in the severely distressed class, but having the best survival chancecompared to large-sized newborns. Through receiver-operating-characteristicsanalysis, the AS new cutoff values for survival and for death &lt;24 h and 24 h-7days of age were identified, and the viability classes were redefined, with anarrower class of moderately distressed puppy specific for each BBS. Inconclusion, the refining of the AS in dog species is imperative, with cutoffvalues and viability classifications that must be adapted to the BBS.

TI  - Feeding Fiber-Bound Polyphenol Ingredients at Different Levels Modulates Colonic Postbiotics to Improve Gut Health in Cats.
LID - 1654 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12131654 [doi]
AB  - Consumption of fiber in its different forms can result in positive healtheffects. Prior studies in dogs found that addition of a fiber bundle (composed ofpecan shells, flax seed, and powders of cranberry, citrus, and beet) to foodresulted in a shift in fecal bacterial metabolism from proteolysis tosaccharolysis. The present study evaluated the changes in fecal metabolites andmicrobiota in healthy cats following the consumption of this fiber bundle.Following a 28-day pre-feed period, 56 healthy adult cats received food with noneor one of three concentrations (0%, 1%, 2%, and 4%) of the fiber bundle for a31-day period. In cats that consumed the 4% fiber bundle, levels of ammonium and fecal branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs) decreased from baseline and comparedwith the other groups. Addition of any level of the fiber bundle resulted inincreases in beneficial metabolites: polyphenols hesperidin, hesperetin,ponciretin, secoisolariciresinol diglucoside, secoisolariciresinol, andenterodiol. Little change in fecal microbiota was observed. Since higher levelsof ammonia and BCFAs indicate putrefactive metabolism, the decreases in thesewith the 4% fiber bundle indicate a shift toward saccharolytic metabolism despitelittle change in the microbiota composition.

TI  - Combination of the Modified Loop Technique and De Vega Annuloplasty in Dogs with Mitral Regurgitation.
LID - 1653 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12131653 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Detailed surgical techniques for treating canine mitral regurgitationhave not been previously reported. METHOD: This case series included sixconsecutive client-owned dogs with mitral regurgitation. All dogs underwent acombined protocol, including the modified loop technique and De Vega annuloplasty(MODEL surgery), in 2021. Artificial loops covering 80% of the length of thestrut chordae tendineae were used for chordal replacement. Mitral annuloplastywas subjectively performed, targeting the circumference of the septal leaflet.RESULTS: The breeds were Chihuahua-mixed breed, Spitz, Pomeranian, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, and Chihuahua, with average ages and weights of 11.4 +/- 2.3years and 5.49 +/- 2.98 kg, respectively. The aortic cross-clamp, pumping, andsurgery times were 64.0 +/- 7.5 min, 168.5 +/- 39.1 min, and 321.0 +/- 53.1 min, respectively. After MODEL surgery, left atrial-to-aortic ratios significantlydecreased from 2.20 +/- 0.18 to 1.26 +/- 0.22 (p &lt; 0.01), and left ventricularend-diastolic internal diameter normalized to body weight significantly decreasedfrom 2.03 +/- 0.26 to 1.48 +/- 0.20 (p &lt; 0.01). In all cases, the clinicalsigns disappeared or improved significantly. CONCLUSIONS: MODEL surgery increasedmitral valve coaptation, normalized heart sizes, and significantly improvedclinical signs in dogs with mitral regurgitation.

TI  - Molecular Epidemiological Survey for Degenerative Myelopathy in German ShepherdDogs in Japan: Allele Frequency and Clinical Progression Rate.
LID - 1647 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12131647 [doi]
AB  - Canine degenerative myelopathy (DM) is an adult-onset, chronic, progressiveneurodegenerative disease reported in multiple canine breeds, including theGerman Shepherd Dog (GSD). Clinical signs include progressive motor neuronparalysis, which begins in the pelvic limbs and eventually leads to respiratorydistress, which may necessitate euthanasia. A common DM-associated mutation is a single nucleotide substitution that causes an amino acid substitution(c.118G&gt;A, p.E40K) in the canine SOD1 gene. This SOD1 mutation and theclinical progression rate of A/A risk genotype in the Japanese GSD populationhave not been analyzed before. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the frequency of the mutated allele and analyze the clinical progression rate in the Japanese GSD population. We studied 541 GSDs registered with the JapaneseGerman Shepherd Dog Registration Society between 2000 and 2019. Genotyping wasperformed using real-time PCR with DNA extracted from the hair roots of each dog.The study revealed 330 G/G dogs (61%), 184 G/A dogs (34%), and 27 A/A dogs (5%), indicating a frequency of the mutant allele of 0.220, which are in Hardy-Weinbergequilibrium. We analyzed the clinical signs in A/A dogs with an age limit of 10years based on information obtained from the dogs' owners. Of the seven A/A dogs older than 10 years, owners reported DM-related clinical signs, indicating aclinical progression rate of 100%. These results, further genotyping, andthorough clinical examinations of SOD1 A/A risk genotype will help control andprevent DM in the Japanese GSD population.

LID - 1645 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12131645 [doi]
AB  - Canine chronic inflammatory enteropathy (CIE) is one of the most common chronicgastrointestinal diseases affecting dogs worldwide. Genetic and environmentalfactors, as well as intestinal microbiota and dysregulated host immune responses,participate in this multifactorial disease. Despite advances explaining theimmunological and molecular mechanisms involved in CIE development, the exactpathogenesis is still unknown. This review compiles the latest reports andadvances that describe the main molecular and cellular mechanisms of both theinnate and adaptive immune responses involved in canine CIE pathogenesis. Future studies should focus research on the characterization of the immunopathogenesisof canine CIE in order to advance the establishment of biomarkers and moleculartargets of diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic utility.

LID - 10.3390/ani12131639 [doi]
AB  - The oral palatability of functional foods such as medium-chain triglycerides(MCT) play a crucial role in owner and patient compliance when used as an adjunctin the management of health conditions such as epilepsy. Despite the promisingbenefits, the palatability of MCT has not undergone a more recent evaluation indogs. The aim of this study was to assess the palatability and tolerance ofshort-term, daily supplementation of a 10% metabolic energy based MCT oil volume compared to a tasteless control oil in healthy dogs. An at-home, randomized,double-blinded, controlled single-bowl palatability test with three five-daysphases was conducted. Data were collected from nineteen healthy dogs via studyvisits, feeding diary and eating questionnaires. No difference in the averagefood intake or intake ratio between food with and without oil supplementation or between the two oil groups was found. The mean food intake time was longer under MCT. In conclusion, MCT oil given as a short-term supplement is well toleratedand palatable in a healthy canine population, with only some changes in eatingbehaviour. Our results support earlier evidence that MCT oil is a well-tolerated additive in the nutritional management of different diseases such as epilepsy or dementia in dogs.

LID - 10.3390/ani12131638 [doi]
AB  - Antioxidant supplementation has been proposed as a new strategy to improve thelong-term preservation of semen. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectof Maca supplementation of semen extender on quality-related canine semenparameters during cooling. Ejaculates from nine dogs were cooled for 7 days inthe absence (control group) or in the presence of 10, 20 and 50 muL/mL of anaqueous extract of Maca. Sperm were evaluated for sperm viability, motility, DNA fragmentation and lipid peroxidation after 3 h, 24 h, 4 days and 7 days ofstorage. The addition of 10 muL/mL of Maca preserved sperm DNA and plasmamembrane integrity at 3 h and increased sperm curvilinear velocity after 24 h.Treatment with 20 and 50 muL/mL of Maca increased the percentage ofhyperactivated sperm after 3 h. Moreover, semen treated with 20 muL/mL of Macadecreased lipid peroxidation at 24 h. A significant reduction of sperm DNA andplasma membrane integrity as well as of kinetics parameters between 3 and 24 h ofrefrigerated storage with the higher concentration tested was observed. Although Maca was not able to protect canine semen with extended refrigeration storagetime, it increased hyperactivation and preserved DNA integrity in short-termstorage.

TI  - Assessment of Nasal Structure Using CT Imaging of Brachycephalic Dog Breeds.
LID - 1636 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12131636 [doi]
AB  - The response to treatment of brachycephalic airway syndrome (BAS) varies amongbrachycephalic dog breeds. We hypothesized that variations in nasal structure areone of the factors responsible for this difference. To confirm this variation, wemeasured the ratio of the airway cross-sectional area to the total nasal cavityarea (AA/NC) in three brachycephalic dog breeds. Head CT images of Frenchbulldogs, shih tzus, and pugs were retrospectively collected. Four specifictransverse planes were used to calculate AA/NC ratios. Fifty brachycephalic dogs were included in the study: French bulldogs (n = 20), shih tzus (n = 20), andpugs (n = 10). The AA/NC ratio of Shih Tzus was larger in the rostral nasalcavity and smaller toward the caudal area, whereas the other two breeds showed aninverse tendency. The results obtained from the current research indicate thatthe AA/NC ratio can be used to evaluate the structure of the nasal cavity.Moreover, analyzing the point with the smallest AA/NC ratio can be useful inquantifying nasal airway obstruction and the severity of BAS. These results will be useful in understanding the complexity of BAS pathophysiology and in theimplementation of treatment.

LID - 10.3390/ani12131631 [doi]
AB  - The long-term effect of femoral head and neck osteotomy (FHO) on the locomotorysystem of dogs was evaluated. The study comprised an owner questionnaire and anorthopaedic examination, anatomical measurements, and pressure-sensitive walkway analysis for dogs. Linear mixed effect models were used for statistical analysis.Ten dogs with a median of 2.5 years since their unilateral FHO were included.According to the questionnaire results, nine dogs had returned to a normalphysical activity level. Muscle atrophy (p = 0.005), less extension in thecoxofemoral joint (p = 0.003), and less static weight bearing on the FHO limb (p = 0.003) were observed. No consistent pattern regarding tilt or position of thepelvis was noted when measuring height of the tuber ischii (p = 0.39). Five ofthe dogs tilted away from, and five towards the FHO side when measured from thetuber sacrale with a Myrin goniometer. No differences regarding stance time,swing time, or peak pressure between the FHO and non-FHO limb were seen in trot(p = 0.70, p = 0.26, and p = 0.91, respectively). Over the long term, the FHOlimb has muscle atrophy, decreased coxofemoral extension, and decreased staticweight bearing. However, this does not seem to affect the trot of the dogs. Dogowners considered the outcome of surgery to be good or excellent.

LID - 10.1186/s13028-022-00634-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The dimensions of the prostatic gland in castrated adult dogs, asassessed by ultrasonography, is currently not yet reported in veterinaryliterature. The current study was aimed at reporting the prostatic dimensions in castrated dogs and investigate the relationship between the dogs' body weight andprostate size. A second aim of the study was to investigate whether there was arelationship between the dogs' age and prostate dimensions. A prospective,single-centre, observational study was conducted and 72 privately owned, adult,male castrated dogs with a range of breeds and ages met the final inclusioncriteria. The subjects were divided into three categories based on body weight.RESULTS: A Kruskal-Wallis test found prostatic length and prostatic depth in the longitudinal orientation to be significantly different among the 3 categories (P < 0.005), with an increase in both prostatic length and prostatic depth withincreasing body weight. Linear regression of the data set provided comprehensive formulas calculating prostatic length and depth based on the body weight of thedog (r(2) of 0.69 and 0.53 for prostatic length and depth respectively).Kendall's Tau rank test showed no correlation between dogs' age and prostatedimensions (P > 0.100). CONCLUSIONS: The current study is the first to provide a comprehensive, weight-based reference for the canine prostate gland of castrated dogs when assessed on ultrasonography.

AB  - Theileriosis is one of the most frequently reported tick borne diseases intropical and subtropical regions and leads to annual economic losses, such as thereduced dairy products and increased casualties. Tropical theileriosis is caused by Theileria annulata and the present study was designed to improve our knowledgeof Theileria annulata infection in Pakistani cattle. In order to assess theprevalence of Theileria annulata on cattle from Multan district in the Punjabprovince (Pakistan) according to seasons and other risk factors, a total of 1020 blood samples (340 samples each from cross, Holstein Frisian and Sahiwal breed)were collected between 2020 and 2022. Based on Tams-1 partial sequenceamplification, the overall T. annulata prevalence was estimated at 11.3%(115/1020). The highest prevalence was observed in autumn season (14.1%),followed by winter (12.9%), summer (11.4%) and spring (6.7%) season. Sahiwalcattle were most susceptible to T. annulata infection (13.2%) followed byCrossbred (11.8%) and Holstein Frisian (8.8%). Epidemiological factor analysisrevealed that female cattle, cattle rose with other dairy animals at farm, tickinfested cattle, and cattle raised with dogs infested with ticks were associated with the prevalence of T. annulata. White blood cells, lymphocyte (%), Monocyte(%) hemoglobin, mean cell hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, and platelet count were significantly affected blood parameters in T. annulatapositive cattle of all three breeds. Representative partial Tams-1 sequences offour Pakistani T. annulata isolates revealed a single genotype genetically close to those infecting cattle from neighboring countries like Iran, Turkey and Egypt.Longitudinal survey and phylogenetic positioning of T. annulata is recommendedfor epidemiological correlation, diagnosis and treatment of theileriosis in such an agricultural region of Pakistan.

AB  - SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND: The aim of this prospective study was to assess whetherthe Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score could be indicative ofoutcome (survival to discharge) in dogs with parvoviral enteritis. METHODS: In 35naturally infected dogs, the SOFA score and clinical score were calculated andthe presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome was verified on admissionand during the first four days of hospitalization. RESULTS: 26 dogs survived, andout of the 9 non-survivors, 6 dogs had positive blood cultures. Mean SOFA scores and clinical scores between survivors and non-survivors and between septic andnon-septic dogs on admission and on each hospitalization day were significantlydifferent. Trends in SOFA score indicated that in non-survivors and septic dogsthere was an increase in SOFA score during the first four days of hospitalizationand a decrease occurred in survivors and non-septic dogs. The area under thecurve (ROC curve analysis) for SOFA score predicting the outcome was 0.797 andpredicting sepsis was 0.834. The best cut-off point of SOFA score for predicting the final outcome was 3.5 and the best cut-off of SOFA score for predictingsepsis was also 3.5. CONCLUSIONS: Either single values or trends in SOFA scorecan assist in suspecting sepsis and reaching prognosis in parvoviral enteritis.

AB  - Canine cognitive dysfunction (CCD) is a highly prevalent neurodegenerativedisease considered the canine analog of early Alzheimer's disease (AD).Unfortunately, CCD cannot be cured. However, early therapeutic interventions can slow the progression of cognitive decline and improve quality of life of thepatients; therefore, early diagnosis is ideal. In humans, electroencephalogram(EEG) findings specific to AD have been described, and some of them havesuccessfully detect early stages of the disease. In this study we characterizedthe EEG correlates of CCD, and we compared them with the EEGs of healthy agingdogs and dogs at risk of developing CCD. EEG recordings were performed in 25senior dogs during wakefulness. Dogs were categorized in normal, at risk of CCDor with CCD according to their score in the Rofina questionnaire. We demonstratedthat, quantitative EEG can detect differences between normal dogs and dogs withCCD. Dogs with CCD experience a reduction in beta and gamma interhemisphericcoherence, and higher Joint Lempel Ziv complexity. Dogs at risk of developingCCD, had higher alpha power and interhemispheric coherence, making these featurespotential markers of early stages of the disease. These results demonstrate that quantitative EEG analysis could aid the diagnosis of CCD, and reinforce the CCDas a translational model of early AD.

AB  - Aging is associated with impairment in postural control in humans. While dogs area powerful model for the study of aging, the associations between age andpostural control in this species have not yet been elucidated. The aims of thiswork were to establish a reliable protocol to measure center of pressureexcursions in standing dogs and to determine age-related changes in posturalsway. Data were obtained from 40 healthy adult dogs (Group A) and 28 senior dogs (Group B) during seven trials (within one session of data collection) of quietstanding on a pressure sensitive walkway system. Velocity, acceleration, rootmean square, 95% ellipse area, range and frequency revolve were recorded asmeasures of postural sway. In Group A, reliability was assessed with intraclasscorrelation, and the effect of morphometric variables was evaluated using linear regression. By means of stepwise linear regression we determined that root meansquare overall and acceleration in the craniocaudal direction were the bestvariables able to discriminate between Group A and Group B. The relationshipbetween these two center-of-pressure (COP) measures and the dogs' fractionallifespan was examined in both groups and the role of pain and proprioceptivedeficits was evaluated in Group B. All measures except for frequency revolveshowed good to excellent reliability. Weight, height and length were correlatedwith most of the measures. Fractional lifespan impacted postural control in GroupB but not Group A. Joint pain and its interaction with proprioceptive deficitsinfluence postural sway especially in the acceleration in the craniocaudaldirection, while fractional lifespan was most important in the overall COPdisplacement. In conclusion, our study found that pressure sensitive walkwaysystems are a reliable tool to evaluate postural sway in dogs; and that postural sway is affected by morphometric parameters and increases with age and jointpain.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0269592 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with extracellular matrix(ECM) remodelling and often coexists with myocardial fibrosis (MF); however, the causality of these conditions is not well established. OBJECTIVE: We aim tocorroborate AF to MF causality by quantifying left atrial (LA) fibrosis incardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images after persistent rapid ventricular pacingand subsequent AF using a canine model and histopathological validation. METHODS:Twelve canines (9 experimental, 3 control) underwent baseline 3D LGE-CMR imaging at 3T followed by insertion of a pacing device and 5 weeks of rapid ventricularpacing to induce AF (experimental) or no pacing (control). Following the 5 weeks,pacing devices were removed to permit CMR imaging followed by excision of thehearts and histopathological imaging. LA myocardial segmentation was performedmanually at baseline and post-pacing to permit volumetric %MF quantificationusing the image intensity ratio (IIR) technique, wherein fibrosis was defined as pixels > mean LA myocardium intensity + 2SD. RESULTS: Volumetric %MF increased byan average of 2.11 +/- 0.88% post-pacing in 7 of 9 experimental dogs. While therewas a significant difference between paired %MF measurements from baseline topost-pacing in experimental dogs (P = 0.019), there was no significant change in control dogs (P = 0.019 and P = 0.5, Wilcoxon signed rank tests). The median %MF for paced animals was significantly greater than that of non-paced dogs at the5-week post-insertion time point (P = 0.009, Mann Whitney U test).Histopathological imaging yielded an average %MF of 19.42 +/- 4.80% (mean +/- SD)for paced dogs compared to 1.85% in one control dog. CONCLUSION: Persistent rapidventricular pacing and subsequent AF leads to an increase in LA fibrosis volumes measured by the IIR technique; however, quantification is limited by inherentimage acquisition parameters and observer variability.

AB  - Profiling the adaptive immune repertoire using next generation sequencing (NGS)has become common in human medicine, showing promise in characterizing clonalexpansion of B cell clones through analysis of B cell receptors (BCRs) inpatients with lymphoid malignancies. In contrast, most work evaluating BCRrepertoires in dogs has employed traditional PCR-based approaches analyzing theIGH locus only. The objectives of this study were to: (1) describe a novel NGSprotocol to evaluate canine BCRs; (2) develop a bioinformatics pipeline forprocessing canine BCR sequencing data; and (3) apply these methods to deriveinsights into BCR repertoires of healthy dogs and dogs undergoing treatment forB-cell lymphoma. RNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy dogs (n =25) and dogs newly diagnosed with intermediate-to-large B-cell lymphoma (n = 18) with intent to pursue chemotherapy was isolated, converted into cDNA andsequenced by NGS. The BCR repertoires were identified and quantified using anovel analysis pipeline. The IGK repertoires of the healthy dogs were far lessdiverse compared to IGL which, as with IGH, was highly diverse. Strong biases at key positions within the CDR3 sequence were identified within the healthy dog BCRrepertoire. For a subset of the dogs with B-cell lymphoma, clonal expansion ofspecific IGH sequences pre-treatment and reduction post-treatment was observed.The degree of expansion and reduction correlated with the clinical outcome inthis subset. Future studies employing these techniques may improve diseasemonitoring, provide earlier recognition of disease progression, and ultimatelylead to more targeted therapeutics.

AB  - Sepsis is a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge and is associated with morbidityand a high risk of death. Metabolomic and lipidomic profiling in sepsis canidentify alterations in metabolism and might provide useful insights into thedysregulated host response to infection, but investigations in dogs are limited. We aimed to use untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics to characterize metabolic pathways in dogs with sepsis to identify therapeutic targets and potentialdiagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. In this prospective observational cohortstudy, we examined the plasma metabolomes and lipidomes of 20 healthy controldogs and compared them with those of 21 client-owned dogs with sepsis. Patientdata including signalment, physical exam findings, clinicopathologic data andclinical outcome were recorded. Metabolites were identified using an untargetedmass spectrometry approach and pathway analysis identified multiple enrichedmetabolic pathways including pyruvaldehyde degradation; ketone body metabolism;the glucose-alanine cycle; vitamin-K metabolism; arginine and betaine metabolism;the biosynthesis of various amino acid classes including the aromatic aminoacids; branched chain amino acids; and metabolism of glutamine/glutamate and the glycerophospholipid phosphatidylethanolamine. Metabolites were identified withhigh discriminant abilities between groups which could serve as potentialbiomarkers of sepsis including 13,14-Dihydro-15-keto Prostaglandin A2;12(13)-DiHOME (12,13-dihydroxy-9Z-octadecenoic acid); and 9-HpODE(9-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid). Metabolites with higher abundance in samplesfrom nonsurvivors than survivors included 3-(2-hydroxyethyl) indole, indoxylsulfate and xanthurenic acid. Untargeted lipidomic profiling revealed multiplesphingomyelin species (SM(d34:0)+H; SM(d36:0)+H; SM(d34:0)+HCOO; andSM(d34:1D3)+HCOO); lysophosphatidylcholine molecules (LPC(18:2)+H) andlipophosphoserine molecules (LPS(20:4)+H) that were discriminating for dogs with sepsis. These biomarkers could aid in the diagnosis of dogs with sepsis, provide prognostic information, or act as potential therapeutic targets.

TI  - A review of the neural control of micturition in dogs and cats: neuroanatomy,neurophysiology and neuroplasticity.
LID - 10.1007/s11259-022-09966-9 [doi]
AB  - This article discusses the current knowledge on the role of the neurologicalstructures, especially the cerebellum and the hypothalamus, and compares theinformation with human medicine. Micturition is a complex voluntary andinvoluntarily mechanism. Its physiological completion strictly depends on thehierarchical organisation of the central nervous system pathways in theperipheral nervous system. Although the role of the peripheral nervous system andsubcortical areas, such as brainstem centres, are well established in veterinary medicine, the role of the cerebellum and hypothalamus have been poorlyinvestigated and understood. Lower urinary tract dysfunction is often associated with neurological diseases that cause neurogenic bladder (NB). Theneuroplasticity of the nervous system in the developmental changes of themechanism of micturition during the prenatal and postnatal periods is alsoanalysed.

TI  - Isolation, typing, and drug susceptibility of Leishmania (Leishmania) infantumisolates from dogs of the municipality of Embu das Artes, an endemic region forcanine leishmaniasis in Brazil.
LID - 10.1007/s00436-022-07594-5 [doi]
AB  - The parasitic protozoa Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum is the etiological agent of human visceral leishmaniasis and canine leishmaniasis in South America, where Brazil is the most affected country. This zoonotic disease is transmitted by the bite of an infected phlebotomine sand fly and dogs constitute the main domesticreservoir of the parasite. In this study, we screened 2348 dogs of themunicipality of Embu das Artes, Brazil, for antibodies against the parasite.Prevalence for canine leishmaniasis seropositivity was 2.81%, as assessed using aDual-Path Platform rapid test for canine leishmaniasis. Twenty-five seropositive dogs were euthanized for parasite isolation and 14 isolates were successfulobtained. Nucleotide sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer confirmed the isolates to be L. (L.) infantum, and very low sequence variability was observedamong them. The in vitro susceptibility to miltefosine and paromomycin wasassessed and moderate variation in paromomycin susceptibility was found among theisolates in the promastigote and intracellular amastigote stages. On the otherhand, in vitro susceptibility to miltefosine of these isolates was homogenous,particularly in the amastigote stage (EC50 values from 0.69 to 2.07 muM). Inaddition, the miltefosine sensitivity locus was deleted in all the isolates,which does not corroborate the hypothesis that the absence of this locus iscorrelated with a low in vitro susceptibility. Our findings confirm that themunicipality of Embu das Artes is endemic for canine leishmaniasis and thatisolates from this region are susceptible to paromomycin and miltefosine,indicating the potential of these drugs to be clinically evaluated in thetreatment of human visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil.

TI  - The cannabinoid receptors system in horses: Tissue distribution and cellularidentification in skin.
PG  - 1508-1524
LID - 10.1111/jvim.16467 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is composed of cannabinoid receptorstype 1 (CBR1) and type 2 (CBR2), cannabinoid-based ligands (endogenous chemicallysynthesized phytocannabinoids), and endogenous enzymes controlling theirconcentrations. Cannabinoid receptors (CBRs) have been identified ininvertebrates and in almost all vertebrate species in the central and peripheral nervous system as well as in immune cells, where they control neuroimmunehomeostasis. In humans, rodents, dogs, and cats, CBRs expression has beenconfirmed in the skin, and their expression and tissue distribution becomedisordered in pathological conditions. Cannabinoid receptors may be a possibletherapeutic target in skin diseases. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the distributionand cellular expression of CBRs in the skin of horses under normal conditions.ANIMALS: Fifteen healthy horses. METHODS: Using full-thickness skin punch biopsy samples, skin-derived primary epidermal keratinocytes and dermal-derived cells,we performed analysis of Cnr1 and Cnr2 genes using real-time PCR and CBR1 andCBR2 protein expression by confocal microscopy and Western blotting. RESULTS:Normal equine skin, including equine epidermal keratinocytes and dermalfibroblast-like cells, all exhibited constant gene and protein expression ofCBRs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Our results represent a starting pointfor developing and translating new veterinary medicine-based pharmacotherapiesusing ECS as a possible target.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Current reports about the use of splenectomy for the management ofimmune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) or immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (ITP)or both in dogs are limited. OBJECTIVES: To retrospectively describe the use ofsplenectomy as part of the management for IMHA, ITP, and concurrent IMHA andsevere thrombocytopenia (CIST) in dogs. It was hypothesized that splenectomywould be beneficial in allowing for reduction of dose of immunosuppressive drugs or discontinuation in 1 or more of these groups. ANIMALS: Seventeen client-owned dogs (7 with IMHA, 7 with ITP, and 3 with CIST) were identified across 7 UK-basedreferral hospitals from a study period of 2005 to 2016. METHODS: Data werecollected retrospectively via questionnaires and included information aboutdiagnosis, management and treatment response before and after splenectomy. Based on clinical outcome, treatment with splenectomy as part of the managementprotocol was classified as either successful or unsuccessful. RESULTS: Six of 7dogs with ITP were managed successfully with splenectomy as part of theirmanagement protocol (3 complete and 3 partial responses), although 1 subsequentlydeveloped suspected IMHA. Of the 7 dogs with IMHA, splenectomy was part of asuccessful management protocol in 4 dogs (2 complete and 2 partial responses). Inthe CIST group, 1 case (1/3) responded completely to management with splenectomy as part of the management protocol. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE:Splenectomy was considered successful and well tolerated in most cases ofisolated ITP. Whether there is a benefit of splenectomy in cases of IMHA and CISTcould not be determined in the current study.

AB  - Duloxetine and thioctic acid (TA) are standard drugs for treating diabeticneuropathy, a primary complication associated with diabetes. In this study, ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry methodswas successfully developed and validated for quantifying duloxetine and TA inbiological samples. The protein precipitation method was used to extractduloxetine, TA and their internal standards from beagle dog plasma. A HypersilGold C18 column (150 x 2.1 mm, 1.9 mum) was used for the experiment. Isocraticelution with 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (A) and 0.1% formic acid (B) wasused for duloxetine, whereas a gradient elution with 0.03% acetic acid (A) andacetonitrile (B) was used for TA. The validated parameters included linearity,sensitivity, accuracy, precision, selectivity, matrix effect, stability, andrecovery under different conditions. The linear ranges of the calibration curves for duloxetine and TA were 5-800 ng/mL and 5-1,000 ng/mL, respectively. An intra-and inter-run precision of +/- 15% can be observed in all quality controlsamples. These methods were successfully used for pharmacokinetics (PKs) studies in beagle dogs to compare PK differences in a fixed-dose combination includingduloxetine and TA and co-administration of the 2 drugs.

AB  - Although periodontal disease is one of the most common (oral) diseases in dogs,an effective treatment approach to periodontitis lacks. The aim of this study wasto evaluate the safety and efficacy of a regenerative, bio-absorbable implantbiomaterial made of medical-grade porcine gelatin, which is cross-linked bytransglutaminase into a porous scaffold for the treatment of periodontitis indogs in a clinical setting. Nine client-owned dogs were included in thismulticenter, prospective interventional clinical study. A split-mouth design was used to treat any teeth with periodontitis; teeth on one side of the mouth weretreated with open periodontal therapy alone (control teeth) and teeth on theother side were treated with open periodontal therapy and the tested implant(teeth treated with the implant). A recheck under general anesthesia wasperformed 3 months after the initial treatment and included periodontal probing, dental radiographs, and/or cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) of the teethincluded in the study. This revealed a reduction of the probing depth (PD) at allteeth, but in teeth treated with the implant, a statistically significantimprovement (average 2.0 mm) over control teeth (average 1.0 mm) was diagnosed.Similarly, alveolar bone height was increased at most of the teeth, but in teeth treated with the implant, a statistically significant improvement (average 1.26mm palatally and 1.51 mm buccally) over control teeth (average 0.58 mm palatally and 0.7 mm buccally) was observed for the buccal site. Open periodontal therapyalone improves clinical parameters and alveolar bone height in dogs withperiodontitis, which is further significantly improved by the addition of theimplant used.

AB  - A cross-sectional study was conducted to identify farm-level risk factorsassociated with avian influenza A H5 and H9 virus exposure on commercial chicken farms in Bangladesh. For broiler farms, both H5 and H9 seropositivity wereassociated with visits by workers from other commercial chicken farms [odds ratio(OR) for H5 = 15.1, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.8-80.8; OR for H9 = 50.1, 95%CI: 4.5-552.7], H5 seropositivity was associated with access of backyard ducks(OR = 21.5, 95% CI: 2.3-201.1), and H9 seropositivity with a number of farmemployees (OR = 9.4, 95% CI: 1.1-80.6). On layer farms, both H5 and H9seropositivity were associated with presence of stray dogs (OR for H5 = 3.1, 95% CI: 1.1-9.1; OR for H9 = 4.0, 95% CI: 1.1-15.3), H5 seropositivity withhatcheries supplying chicks (OR = 0.0, 95% CI: 0.0-0.3), vehicles entering farms (OR = 5.8, 95% CI: 1.5-22.4), number of farm employees (OR = 5.8, 95% CI:1.2-28.2), and burying of dead birds near farms (OR = 4.6, 95% CI: 1.2-17.3); H9 seropositivity with traders supplying feed (OR = 5.9, 95% CI: 1.0-33.9), visitsconducted of other commercial poultry farms (OR = 4.7, 95% CI: 1.1-20.6), number of spent layers sold (OR = 24.0, 95% CI: 3.7-155.0), and frequency of replacingchicken droppings (OR = 28.3, 95% CI: 2.8-284.2). Policies addressing these risk factors will increase the effectiveness of prevention and control strategiesreducing the risk of avian influenza on commercial chicken farms.

AB  - Based on the Wallerian degeneration in the spinal cord pathways, the changes insynaptic connections, and the spinal cord-related cellular responses that alterthe cellular structure of the brain, we presumed that brain diffusion tensorimaging (DTI) parameters may change after spinal cord injury. However, thedynamic changes in DTI parameters remain unclear. We established a Beagle dogmodel of T10 spinal cord contusion and performed DTI of the injured spinal cord. We found dynamic changes in DTI parameters in the cerebral peduncle, posteriorlimb of the internal capsule, pre- and postcentral gyri of the brain within 12weeks after spinal cord injury. We then performed immunohistochemistry to detect the expression of neurofilament heavy polypeptide (axonal marker), glialfibrillary acidic protein (glial cell marker), and NeuN (neuronal marker). Wefound that these pathological changes were consistent with DTI parameter changes.These findings suggest that DTI can display brain structure changes after spinal cord injury.

TI  - Occurrence and potential transmission of extended-spectrumbeta-lactamase-producing extraintestinal pathogenic and enteropathogenicEscherichia coli in domestic dog faeces from Minnesota.
LID - 10.1111/zph.12985 [doi]
AB  - Interactions between humans and pets are increasingly valued in westerncountries, leading to more extensive contact between humans and their pets withinhouseholds. Although the magnitude of the risk of transfer of Escherichia colibetween humans and their companion animals is undefined, that such transmissionoccurs has been established and warrants attention. This study examined 186 freshfaecal samples from companion dogs visiting 22 municipal dog parks in theMinneapolis/Saint Paul metropolitan area, Minnesota, USA. Samples were processed to isolate 3rd-generation cephalosporin-resistant E. coli, which were furthercharacterized using PCR-based virulence genotyping, antimicrobial susceptibility profiling and whole-genome sequencing. Of the 186 faecal samples, 29% yieldedcephalosporin-resistant E. coli, and 2.2% yielded extended-spectrumbeta-lactamase producers. Co-resistance to sulfonamides was typical (77.3% ofisolates), and multidrug resistance (i.e. to >/=3 antimicrobial classes),including to combinations of tetracyclines, phenicols, quinolones andaminoglycosides, was substantial (18.9% of isolates). Identified beta-lactamasegenes included blaCMY-2 , blaTEM-1B , blaTEM-1 , blaCTX-M-24 , blaCTX-M-15 andblaOXA-1 . Genome sequencing of 14 isolates identified genes typical ofextraintestinal pathogenic E. coli or enteropathogenic E. coli. In threeinstances, closely related isolates were recovered from different dogs, withineither the same park-suggesting transfer of E. coli between dogs within thepark-or different parks-suggesting that dogs may be pre-disposed to carry certainE. coli types, such as those from serogroups O4, O71 and O157. This study adds tothe existing evidence that companion dogs can harbour and shareantimicrobial-resistant E. coli with presumed intestinal or extraintestinalpathogenic potential.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopleural fistula (BPF) is a critical complication that mayprogress to pneumonia and empyema, but optimal treatment remains uncertain. Ourpurpose was to develop a novel material for bronchial occlusion that can be used to treat BPF by blocking airflow and promoting wound healing. METHODS: Spongeswere prepared over a range of concentrations (25-50 mg/dL) of silk-elastin byhydrophobic processing. Five adult beagle dogs underwent right anterior lobectomyand five underwent left posterior lobectomy. Silk-elastin sponges were placed at bronchial stumps of eight dogs, while the silicone plugs were placed at thestumps of two dogs as a control. RESULTS: Postoperative complications were notobserved except in one dog in which the silicone plug had been placed and whichhad massive subcutaneous emphysema at 4 weeks after surgery. Histologicalexamination revealed that stumps were covered with connective tissue and thatthere was more regeneration of airway epithelium in the silk-elastin sponge groupthan in the silicone plug group. There were increased numbers of myofibroblastsaround the bronchial stump occluded by silk-elastin sponges at 2 weeks following placement, which completely disappeared after 2 months during which abundantneovascularization occurred. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that silk-elastin sponges canmanage and promote regeneration of bronchial epithelium. Our results demonstrate that bronchial occlusion with a silk-elastin sponge is a promising option fortreatment of BPF.

PG  - e20210142
LID - 10.3138/jvme-2021-0142 [doi]
AB  - Successful placement of intravenous catheters (IVC) is a basic and essentialclinical skill for veterinary students. The purposes of this study were todetermine the overall success rate for IVC placement in cats and dogs whenfinal-year veterinary students are performing the procedure in a clinicalsetting, to determine if self-assessed experience level affects IVC placementsuccess rates, and to identify factors affecting student success with thisprocedure. Final-year students were asked to complete an anonymous surveyfollowing each catheter placement attempt during their 3-week core emergencymedicine rotation. The survey included self-assessed level of experience, patientspecies, indication for IVC placement, restrainer, catheter type, insertion site,use of sedation, and perceived degree of coaching. Success or failure in catheterplacement was recorded and two attempts were allowed. A Chi-square test was used to evaluate differences between insertion outcomes in dogs and cats. A univariatelogistic regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between success and all other variables. A total of 256 catheters were attempted by students,with an overall success rate of 61%. The cephalic vein was associated withsuccessful placement compared with the saphenous vein (p = .005). There was norelationship between successful catheter placement and self-assessed experience, species, indication for IVC placement, insertion site, use of sedation, catheter type, or restrainer. Final-year veterinary students do not master intravenouscatheterization in the emergency room setting, and additional studies arerequired to improve clinical instruction in this area.

TI  - Heterogeneity in dog population characteristics contributes to chronicunder-vaccination against rabies in Guatemala.
PG  - e0010522
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010522 [doi]
AB  - Guatemala has held dog rabies mass vaccination campaigns countrywide since 1984, yet the virus remains endemic. To eliminate dog-mediated human rabies, dogvaccination coverage must reach at least 70%. The Guatemala rabies program uses a5:1 human:dog ratio (HDR) to estimate the vaccination coverage; however, thismethod may not accurately reflect the heterogeneity of dog ownership practices inGuatemalan communities. We conducted 16 field-based dog population estimates inurban, semi-urban and rural areas of Guatemala to determine HDR and evaluate the standard 5:1. Our study-derived HDR estimates varied from 1.7-11.4:1 (average4.0:1), being higher in densely populated sites and lowest in rural communities. The community-to-community heterogeneity observed in dog populations couldexplain the persistence of rabies in certain communities. To date, this is themost extensive dog-population evaluation conducted in Guatemala, and can be used to inform future rabies vaccination campaigns needed to meet the global 2030rabies elimination targets.

PG  - 1341-1352
LID - 10.1111/jvim.16482 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Calcium oxalate (CaOx) uroliths are common in dogs. Humans with CaOx urolithiasis exhibit alterations of the urinary and urogenital microbiomes thatmight mediate urolith formation. Detection of urogenital microbes associated withCaOx in dogs could inform disease pathophysiology. OBJECTIVE: To identifycompositional differences in the urogenital microbiome of Miniature Schnauzerswith and without CaOx uroliths. ANIMALS: Nineteen midstream, voided urine samplesfrom Miniature Schnauzers with (n = 9) and without (n = 10) a history of CaOxurolithiasis. METHODS: Analytical cross-sectional study. Microbial DNA wasextracted from previously frozen urine samples and sequenced for the bacterial16S rRNA V3-V4 hypervariable regions. Diversity and composition of microbialpopulations were compared between urolith formers and controls. RESULTS: Alphaand beta diversity measures were similar between groups. Five individualbacterial taxa differed in abundance (indicator values >0.5 and P < .05):Acinetobacter, 2 Geobacillus variants, and Hydrogenophaga were overrepresented inthe urine of urolith formers, and Sphingopyxis was overrepresented in controls.Two distinct subtypes of urine microbial composition were observed based on beta diversity measures, independent of urolith status, and other clinical variables. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Although we did not detect a difference inthe overall urogenital microbial composition between groups, observed differencesin individual bacterial taxa might be clinically relevant. For example,Acinetobacter was overrepresented in urolith formers and is associated with CaOx urolithiasis in humans. Two unique clusters of the microbiome were identified,independent of urolith status, which may represent distinct urotypes present inMiniature Schnauzers.

TI  - Bone morphogenetic protein-2 incorporated calcium phosphate graft promotesperi-implant bone defect healing in dogs: A pilot study.
LID - 10.1002/cre2.613 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The evaluation of three different drug delivery modes of bonemorphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) in healing peri-implant bone defects in beagledogs. BMP-2 was incorporated in or onto calcium phosphate (CaP) granules invarious ways: (i) directly on the outer layer of granules CaP: as an adsorbeddepot; (ii) during the entire precipitation process of CaP: an internallyincorporated depot; or (iii) during the biomimetic coating precipitation of BMP-2on the surface of CaP granules: as a coating incorporated depot. MATERIAL ANDMETHODS: After extraction of the lower molars and wound healing in 6 male beagle dogs, 36 implants were placed (n = 6 animal per group). Peri-implant bone defectswere induced. The following treatment groups were evaluated: no treatment; airabrasive surface cleaning (SC) using hydroxyapatite; SC and the subsequentfilling of the defect with CaP without BMP-2; SC plus the subsequent filling ofthe defect with CaP adsorbed BMP-2; SC plus the subsequent filling of the defect with CaP internally incorporated BMP-2; SC plus the subsequent filling of thedefect with CaP coating incorporated BMP-2. Histological and histomorphometricanalyses were carried out to quantify and compare the changes in bone tissuesurrounding the treated implants. RESULTS: In Group 1 with no treatment, fourimplants were lost. Group 5 with the SC and the subsequent filling of the defect with internally incorporated BMP-2 biomimetically prepared CaP (BioCaP), whereby the BMP-2 is incorporated in the entire volume of all BioCaP particles, showedoverall the best results to regenerate bone around the implants. CONCLUSION: Thisstudy concluded that the group treated with SC plus the subsequent filling of thedefect with CaP BMP-2 internally incorporated BMP-2, whereby BMP-2 has beenincorporated in the entire volume of all CaP particles, showed overall the bestresults when aiming to regenerate bone around the implants.

TI  - First detection and molecular characterization of Dientamoeba fragilis in cattle.
LID - 10.1111/zph.12986 [doi]
AB  - Dientamoeba fragilis is a flagellated protozoan with amoeba-like morphology that inhabits the human gastrointestinal tract. It is endemic in a vast geographyaround the world, including developed countries. There are limited studies onnon-human hosts of the parasite, and suitable hosts have not been clarified. The parasite has been detected in non-human primates, pigs, cats, dogs and rats.There is no study in the literature investigating and detecting the presence ofthis parasite in cattle. In this study, stool samples taken from 163 differentcattle and calves from 11 different farms between March 2017 and May 2022 wereexamined for the detection of D. fragilis via PCR. Trichrome staining wasperformed on all PCR-positive samples. The isolates with the expected ampliconsize were sequenced using the 18S ribosomal RNA region, and their genotypes were determined by BLAST analysis. Sequences were analysed with the most similar andreference sequences in the literature, forming a phylogenetic tree. We detectedD. fragilis in 31 (19.01%) of the 163 stool samples. D. fragiliscysts/trophozoites were detected by trichrome staining method in six of 31samples. All PCR products selected for molecular analysis from positive sampleshad the same nucleotide sequence. As a result of BLAST analysis, all sequenceswere determined to belong to D. fragilis genotype 1. This study determined forthe first time that cattle are suitable hosts for D. fragilis. Furthermore, theparasite subtype we detected belongs to genotype 1, which is the most common typein humans, suggesting that the parasite may have a zoonotic character. Our resultis important in terms of the epidemiology of the parasite, as the mode oftransmission is controversial, and available data on its suitable hosts arelimited.

TI  - Generalization of threats attributed to large carnivores in areas of highhuman-wildlife conflict.
PG  - e13974
LID - 10.1111/cobi.13974 [doi]
AB  - Fear-induced generalization of threats to noninimical stimuli is a behavioraltendency of humans to minimize exposure to potential threats. In human-carnivore conflict zones, people often generalize their fear of predation by obligatecarnivores to nonobligate carnivores despite differences in species' predationrates. We investigated the effect of a perceived threat of large obligatecarnivores to livestock on tolerance and perception of striped hyena (Hyaenahyaena) in an area of high human-carnivore conflict. We surveyed 197 householdsthrough asemistructured questionnaire to determine people's perception andtolerance of striped hyenas in Sathyamangalam and Mudumalai Tiger Reserves after identification of the current distribution range of hyena determined throughcamera trap and sign surveys. Through the random forest algorithm, we modeled thelevel of tolerance of striped hyena as a function of loss of livestock topredation and from disease, the perceived threat of predation by hyena, and othersocioeconomic attributes. Animal husbandry was a major source of income but wasseverely affected by livestock loss due to predation and disease. Sixty-ninepercent of people were uncertain about predatory behavior of hyena; out of that, 23% reported a negative conservation attitude. Only 6 instances of hyenadepredation on livestock and 2 on dogs were reported. Our model confirmed thateconomic instability associated with increased loss to predation and disease,livestock dependency, and a decrease in family annual income negatively affected people's tolerance of hyena. Perceptual uncertainty related to predatory behaviorof hyena also negatively affected people's tolerance. In our study area, economicinstability and perceptual uncertainty led to generalization of fear of largecarnivores to a nonobligate predator. Such generalization may affect the attitudeof people toward many other species. Understanding the role of economicinstability and perceptual uncertainty should facilitate conservation of species,such as the hyena, that are vulnerable to false generalization.

LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.861064 [doi]
AB  - Background: The diagnosis of acute pulmonary thromboembolism is challenging indogs. Little has been reported on changes in echocardiographic indices in dogswith acute pulmonary thromboembolism. The objective of this study was to validatethe relationship between echocardiographic indices and right heartcatheterization variables in dogs with acute pulmonary embolism and to identify auseful echocardiographic index for diagnosing acute pulmonary embolism. Materialsand Methods: Six healthy laboratory beagles were included in the study.Echocardiography and right heart catheterization were performed in a dog model ofacute pulmonary embolism produced by microsphere injection. Echocardiographicindices, including the right ventricular (RV) Tei index, RV longitudinal strain, and the dyssynchrony index using speckle tracking echocardiography, transmitralflow, and eccentricity index, were measured. Results: The mean pulmonary arterialpressure increased (22.2 +/- 1.2 mmHg) and the blood pressure decreased aftermicrosphere injection. Although the mean pulmonary arterial pressure remainedelevated, the blood pressure recovered 2 days after the microsphere injection.Most echocardiographic indices of RV function were significantly impairedfollowing microsphere injection and recovered after 2 days. In contrast, the RVTei index was significantly impaired after microsphere injection and theimpairment persisted after 2 days. Multivariable analysis revealed that the RVTei index was an independent echocardiographic predictor of pulmonary vascularresistance (beta = 0.88, P < 0.001), and transmitral early diastolic wave was an independent predictor of the cardiac index (beta = -0.86, P = 0.001).Conclusions: The RV Tei index is a useful echocardiographic index for diagnosing acute pulmonary embolism. Ventricular interdependence may be an important factor causing low cardiac output in dogs with acute pulmonary embolism.

LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.880018 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To compare prosthetic disc and vertebral distraction stabilization in dogs with disc-associated cervical spondylomyelopathy (DA-CSM). Study Design: Aretrospective clinical study. Animals: 25 dogs. Methods: Dogs presenting withclinical signs and MRI findings compatible with DA-CSM underwent surgery.Implantation of the Adamo's prosthetic disc (PD) or vertebraldistraction-stabilization (DS) with intervertebral cage, ventral locking plates, and dorsal transarticular screws was performed. All dogs were followed-up andevaluated clinically for a minimum of 1 year and radiographically for at least 3 months. In particular, we focused on the evaluation of subsidence (the degree of vertebral collapse). Results: Twenty-five dogs were enrolled: 12 with PDimplantation and 13 with DS implantation. Of these, 24 dogs were followed-up at 1year. Overall, 12 dogs improved (4 PD and 8 DS), eight were stable (4 PD and 4DS), and four deteriorated (3 PD and 1 DS). Deterioration was more common in PDcases, especially soon after surgery. In a few PD cases, a second surgery wasnecessary. The most common complication in dogs with DS was discospondylitis.Subsidence was detected in 11 PD and 7 DS dogs. Subsidence was more severe andoccurred sooner after surgery in PD cases compared to DS cases. DS cases weremore prone to clinical improvement and less prone to subsidence than PD cases in this study. However, the statistical evidence was weak owing to the small sample size. Conclusion: The preliminary results suggest that prosthetic discimplantation is more prone to clinical and radiographic failures than distractionstabilization. Clinical Relevance: The DS technique is a valuable surgical optionfor treating dogs with DA-CSM, with favorable short- and long-term clinical andradiographic outcomes.

AB  - Interdigital furunculosis is a common multifactorial, inflammatory disease of thecanine interdigital skin in which lesions commonly become secondarily infected.Fluorescence biomodulation (FBM) administered twice weekly has shown toeffectively control clinical manifestation as adjunct therapy to systemicantibiotic. Since twice weekly regimen could be unaffordable for some pet owners,the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of once weekly application ofFBM in combination with systemic antibiotic on clinical manifestations of canine interdigital pyoderma, comparing the results to those present in literature.Twelve dogs diagnosed with interdigital pyoderma received antibiotic plus onceweekly FBM application. Dogs were scored until complete healing based on globallesion score and neutrophil engulfing bacterial score. The results obtaineddemonstrated that once weekly application of FBM exerts the same beneficialeffect on interdigital furunculosis healing as per twice weekly, indicating that once weekly regimen is well tolerated and is yielding similar results to twiceweekly applications.

LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.930856 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Hypophysectomy in dogs is a difficult surgery that requires specificlearning and training. We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of a 3-dimensionalprinted patient-specific surgical guide to facilitate choosing the entry point inthe basisphenoid bone before approaching the sella turcica during transsphenoidalhypophysectomy in dogs. Methods: Two canine cadavers and 8 dogs undergoingtranssphenoidal hypophysectomy for Cushing's disease treatment, involving design and fabrication of a 3-dimensional printed guide. The ideal entry point in thebasisphenoid bone outer cortical layer was determined in each dogpre-operatively; its anatomical location was described with a set of measurementsthen compared to post-operative computed tomography measures describing thelocation of the outer cortical window created in the basisphenoid bone. Results: Several guide designs were proposed, and a consensus reached based on surgeons'experience performing hypophysectomy. The device chosen could be applied to thesize and shape of skulls encountered in this case series. The pre-plannedmeasurements were comparable to post-operative measurement (there was also nostatistical difference), with median of differences <0.1 mm, which we judged asclinically acceptable. Clinical Significance: Hypophysectomy in dogs is achallenging procedure that has a learning curve and needs to be performed byspecialist neurosurgeons. We propose that a low-profile 3-dimensional printedsurgical guide can aid the specialist neurosurgeon to locate the burring site of the outer cortical layer of the basisphenoid bone at a pre-defined location andwith good accuracy. It does not alleviate the need to understand the anatomy ofthe region and to know how to create a slot within the basisphenoid bone, whichremains essential to enter the sella turcica. This device could help specialistveterinary neurosurgeons wishing to be trained to perform hypophysectomy.

AB  - Parasites are important components of the immense n-dimensional trophic networkthat connects all living beings because they, among others, forge biodiversityand deeply influence ecological evolution and host behavior. In this sense, theinfluence of Trypanosomatidae remains unknown. The aim of this study was todetermine trypanosomatid infection and richness in rats, opossums, and dogs inthe semiarid Caatinga biome. We submitted DNA samples from trypanosomatidsobtained through axenic cultures of the blood of these mammals to mini exonmultiplex-PCR, Sanger, and next-generation sequencing targeting the 18S rDNAgene. Phylogenetic analyses were performed to identify genetic diversity in theTrypanosomatidae family. Shannon, Simpson, equability, and beta-diversity indiceswere calculated per location and per mammalian host. Dogs were surveyed fortrypanosomatid infection through hemocultures and serological assays. Theexamined mammal species of this area of the Caatinga biome exhibited an enormous trypanosomatid species/genotypes richness. Ten denoised Operational TaxonomicUnits (ZOTUs), including three species (Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma rangeliand Crithidia mellificae) and one Trypanosoma sp. five genotypes/lineages (T.cruzi DTU TcI, TcII, and TcIV; T. rangeli A and B) and four DTU TcI haplotypes(ZOTU1, ZOTU2, ZOTU5, and ZOTU10 merged), as well as 13 Amplicon SequenceVariants (ASVs), including five species (T. cruzi, T. rangeli, C. mellificae,Trypanosoma dionisii, and Trypanosoma lainsoni), five genotypes/lineages (same asthe ZOTUs) and six DTU TcI haplotypes (ASV, ASV1, ASV2, ASV3, ASV5 and ASV13),were identified in single and mixed infections. We observed that trypanosomatids present a broad host spectrum given that species related to a single host arefound in other mammals from different taxa. Concomitant infections betweentrypanosomatids and new host-parasite relationships have been reported, and this immense diversity in mammals raised questions, such as how this can influence thecourse of the infection in these animals and its transmissibility. Dogsdemonstrated a high infection rate by T. cruzi as observed by positiveserological results (92% in 2005 and 76% in 2007). The absence of positiveparasitological tests confirmed their poor infectivity potential but theirimportance as sentinel hosts of T. cruzi transmission.

TI  - Comparison of surgeon experience using simple interrupted and simple continuoussuture patterns in intestinal resection and anastomosis.
PG  - 165-171
AB  - This experimental study compared leak pressures and completion time of intestinalanastomoses performed by novice veterinarians and a Board-certified surgeon usingsimple interrupted and simple continuous suture patterns. Grossly normal jejunal segments (n = 108) from 6 fresh canine cadavers were used to harvest 8-cm cooled canine cadaveric jejunal segments that were randomly assigned to a control group (12 segments) and 4 treatment groups (24 segments/group, 12 constructs/group): i)simple interrupted anastomoses performed by a Board-certified surgeon (BSI); ii) simple continuous anastomoses performed by a Board-certified surgeon (BSC); iii) simple interrupted anastomoses performed by novice veterinarians (NSI); and iv)simple continuous anastomoses performed by novice veterinarians (NSC). Median(range) initial leak pressure (ILP) for control was 400.2 mmHg (226.0 to 500.0mmHg), BSI 37.4 (14.4 to 124.0), BSC 32.5 (13.4 to 91.0), NSI 36.5 (22.9 to62.0), and NSC 47.5 (8.9 to 120.0). No difference was noted between experience (P= 0.73, P = 0.53), suture technique (P = 0.07, P = 0.38), or across treatmentgroups (P = 0.17, P = 0.94), for ILP or MIP (maximum intraluminal pressure),respectively. Time to construct completion differed based on suture technique (P < 0.0001) and experience (P < 0.0001). The median and mean ILP of all anastomosesexceeded physiologic intraluminal peristaltic pressures. Simple continuousanastomoses were faster to complete overall. Both handsewn anastomosis techniquesare appropriate for intestinal anastomoses.

TI  - Evaluation of mechanical properties of self-expanding metal stents foroptimization of tracheal collapse in dogs.
PG  - 188-193
AB  - The objective of this study was to compare the mechanical properties, includingradial, axial, and bending forces, of various self-expanding metal stents withdifferent wire diameters. The radial forces generated through longitudinal andcylindrical compression, along with axial and bending forces, were measured andused to evaluate the mechanical properties of 3 types of self-expanding metalstents (n = 3); the most suitable type was further assessed with 4 different wirediameters (n = 3). The D-type stent (double-wire woven uncovered nitinol stent)had the highest radial force and the lowest axial force and hence, was the mostsuitable for clinical use; however, its bending force was the lowest,corroborating the results of the axial force measurements. Therefore, the D-type stent was further evaluated using the following wire diameters: i) 0.127, ii)0.152, iii) 0.178, and iv) 0.203 mm. When the wire diameter was increased by0.025 mm, the measured radial, axial, and bending forces increased significantly.Thus, the adequate wire diameter should be determined based on the anatomicalstructure of stents. The mechanical properties of self-expanding stents should beconsidered in selecting the optimal design for tracheal collapse in dogs.

TI  - Comparison of home blood pressure and office blood pressure measurement in dogsand cats.
PG  - 203-208
AB  - The objectives of this study were to retrospectively compare blood pressuremeasurements obtained in clinic with those obtained at home from cats and dogsseen at our hospital and to investigate the potential for white-coat effect (WCE)and white-coat hypertension (WCH) in this population of 10 cats and 7 dogs.Medical records from Western College of Veterinary Medicine were searched toidentify patients with paired home and in-clinic blood pressure measurementstaken within 14 d. The results were compared with matched-pair analysis todetermine the agreement and bias. Significantly higher systolic and diastolicblood pressures were measured in the clinic compared with those from homemeasurements. A mean difference of +27.7 mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI): 17.1to 38.3 mmHg, P < 0.001] and +12.9 mmHg (95% CI: 6.4 to 19.5 mmHg, P = 0.0007)was found for systolic and diastolic pressure, respectively. The prevalence ofWCH in this population was 41%. A total of 39% of home blood pressuremeasurements by owners were free of artefacts as evaluated by waveforms onhigh-definition oscillometry (HDO) devices. The results of this study showed thatblood pressure measurements taken at home and at a clinic varied significantly,which was attributed to a high prevalence of white-coat effect and white-coathypertension in this clinical population.

TI  - Exclusive circulation of canine parvovirus type 2c in the Guadalajarametropolitan area in western Mexico: a five-year study.
LID - 10.1007/s00705-022-05522-7 [doi]
AB  - Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) infection in dogs is associated with severegastroenteritis, bloody diarrhea, and vomiting, resulting in high rates of death,especially in unvaccinated puppies within the first months of age. There arethree variants, called CPV-2a, CPV-2b, and CPV-2c, co-circulating worldwide. Our group previously reported that the only circulating CPV-2 variant in theGuadalajara metropolitan area in western Mexico was type 2c. Now, a five-yearstudy was performed in order to investigate the possible dominance of CPV-2c inour region. Rectal swabs were collected from 146 dogs with clinicalgastroenteritis from May 2014 to August 2019 at the Veterinary Hospital of theUniversity of Guadalajara. Of these, 90 dogs tested positive for canineparvovirus by PCR. Most of the infected dogs with CPV-2 had a partial orincomplete vaccination status (n = 88, 97.8%). Approximately 65% (n = 59) of themwere mixed-breed dogs, 77.8% (n = 70) were under 6 months of age, and 37.8% (n = 34) of them died from clinical complications. RFLP analysis of amplicons derived from the vp2 gene showed that all 90 DNA samples corresponded to CPV-2c, with no evidence of the presence of CPV-2a or CPV-2b variants. Twenty-nine of the 90 DNA samples were selected for amplification of a portion of the vp2 gene, andsequencing of these amplicons showed that all of them had the sequence GAA atcodon 426, encoding the amino acid glutamic acid, which is characteristic ofCPV-2c. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the CPV-2c sequences were related tothose of viruses from Europe and South America. The present study indicates that CPV-2c is still the only variant circulating in the dog population of theGuadalajara metropolitan area.

TI  - Ironing out the wrinkles and folds in the epidemiology of skin fold dermatitis indog breeds in the UK.
PG  - 10553
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-14483-5 [doi]
AB  - Skin fold dermatitis (intertrigo) is an inflammatory process of closely apposing skin surfaces. Extreme conformations towards folded skin in many dog breeds arelinked with higher risk. Using anonymised primary-care veterinary data from theVetCompass Programme, this study aimed to report the frequency, demographic risk factors and clinical management for skin fold dermatitis in the UK. Risk factoranalysis used random effects multivariable logistic regression modelling. From a study population of 905,553 dogs, the one-year period prevalence in dogs overall was 0.37% (95% CI 0.35-0.39). Diagnosis was supported by laboratory testing in4.21% cases. Systemic antibiosis was used in 42.30% cases. Compared withcrossbreed dogs, the most highly predisposed breeds were English Bulldog (oddsratio [OR] 49.07, 95% CI 37.79-63.70), French Bulldog (OR 25.92, 95% CI19.62-34.26,) and Pug (OR 16.27, 95% CI 12.20-21.69). The most protected breedswere Yorkshire Terrier (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.03-0.56), Border Collie (OR 0.31, 95%CI 0.11-0.84), Jack Russell Terrier (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.30-0.92) and LabradorRetriever (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.35-0.93). This study adds further evidence to thewelfare concerns around high popularity of dog breeds with extreme conformations.The three breeds with by far the highest odds of skin fold dermatitis representan extreme brachycephalic conformation.

AB  - Free-roaming dogs can present significant challenges to public health, wildlifeconservation, and livestock production. Free-roaming dogs may also experiencepoor health and welfare. Dog population management is widely conducted tomitigate these issues. To ensure efficient use of resources, it is critical that effective, cost-efficient, and high-welfare strategies are identified. The dogpopulation comprises distinct subpopulations characterised by their restrictionstatus and level of ownership, but the assessment of dog population managementoften fails to consider the impact of the interaction between subpopulations onmanagement success. We present a system dynamics model that incorporates aninteractive and dynamic system of dog subpopulations. Methods incorporating both fertility control and responsible ownership interventions (leading to a reductionin abandonment and roaming of owned dogs, and an increase in shelter adoptions)have the greatest potential to reduce free-roaming dog population sizes overlonger periods of time, whilst being cost-effective and improving overallwelfare. We suggest that future management should be applied at high levels ofcoverage and should target all sources of population increase, such asabandonment, births, and owners of free-roaming dogs, to ensure effective andcost-efficient reduction in free-roaming dog numbers.

TI  - Mediastinal Serous Cavity Mesothelioma in Two Dogs.
PG  - 194-202
LID - 10.5326/JAAHA-MS-7016 [doi]
AB  - The mediastinal serous cavity (MSC)-well documented but seldom recognized in the caudal mediastinum-is embryologically derived from the omental bursa.Mesothelioma arising from the MSC in two dogs is described. Both dogs presentedwith acute life-threatening hemorrhagic pleural effusion. Contrast computedtomography revealed a large solitary spherical-to-cylindrical tumor in the caudalmediastinum with variably thick, contrast-enhancing walls with lobular tofrond-like proliferations that arose circumferentially and projected internallyinto a single, variably sized, fluid-attenuating lumen. The wall and lumencorresponded to the serous membrane and serous cavity of the MSC. Surgicalexploration confirmed that both tumors arose from the mediastinum. Both hadsimilar histologic findings, and special stains were necessary for definitivediagnosis. The tumor was nonresectable in one dog, and it was euthanizedintraoperatively. The other survived 7 mo. An MSC mesothelioma should beconsidered a possible cause of hemothorax in dogs that may be detected onthoracic radiography and computed tomography. Differential diagnoses includeesophageal foreign body or neoplasm, paraesophageal diaphragmatic hernia, MCSempyema, and pulmonary adenocarcinoma, with thoracic computed tomography helping to rule out foreign body and diaphragmatic hernia. For confirmed neoplasms,histochemistry and immunohistochemistry should be performed to differentiatebetween mesothelioma and pulmonary adenocarcinoma.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus is a common endocrinopathy in dogs that has been associatedwith various biochemical changes and comorbid diseases, but hematologicabnormalities have been rarely reported. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate complete blood count and blood smear alterations and to describetheir relationship with, and incidence of comorbid diseases in, diabetic dogs.Three-hundred twelve diabetic dogs, 286 dogs diagnosed with systemic, nondiabeticillnesses, and 506 healthy dogs were identified during the study period. Groupswere compared using contingency tables and logistic regression. Associationsbetween statistically significant complete blood count and blood smearalterations and comorbidities were evaluated using multivariable analysis.High-grade codocytosis and anisocytosis were identified more frequently indiabetic dogs, whereas high-grade reactive lymphocytosis and keratocytosis wereidentified less frequently (P < .001). Diabetic dogs with high-grade codocytosis had lower red blood cell, hemoglobin, hematocrit and higher white blood cellcounts (P < .001). Diabetic ketoacidosis was diagnosed more frequently indiabetic dogs with high-grade codocytosis when compared with those with low-gradecodocytosis (P < .001) or when compared with any other cell morphologicalterations. This study suggests that blood smear analysis should be a routinepart of the evaluation of diabetic dogs.

AB  - Abdominal ultrasound with spleen and liver cytology is part of routine stagingfor canine mast cell tumors (MCTs). However, such tests are associated withincreased morbidity and cost. Therefore, the objectives of this study were todetermine if spleen cytology was predictive of liver cytology in canine MCTs and if any patient or tumor variables were associated with spleen and/or livermetastasis. Records of dogs with MCTs and cytology of spleen and liver werereviewed. Two hundred five patients were included. Overall, 22 (10.7%) patientshad metastasis, with 21 (10.2%) and 13 (6.3%) having spleen and liver metastasis,respectively, and 12 (5.9%) having both. For patients with a positive (ornegative) spleen cytology, the odds ratio of having a positive (or negative)liver cytology was 233.49. However, a negative spleen cytology had a higherpredictive value (0.99) than a positive cytology (0.54). Finally, the presence oflocal and systemic signs and tumor size were associated with spleen, liver,and/or spleen or liver metastasis. These results suggest that spleen cytology is predictive of liver cytology in staging of canine MCTs, and increasing tumor sizeand presence of local or systemic signs are associated with an increased risk of visceral metastasis.

AB  - The prognosis for bile duct carcinoma in dogs is generally believed to be poor.However, only a few studies have evaluated the postoperative outcomes in suchcases. The objective of this case series was to describe the postoperativeoutcomes of localized intrahepatic bile duct carcinoma in dogs. The electronicmedical records of 16 dogs with bile duct carcinoma were reviewed, and 6 dogswere included in the study. All cases were diagnosed as bile duct carcinoma usingpostoperative pathology, and five of them had already been diagnosed usingpreoperative core biopsy. The tumors in all of the dogs were confirmed ascompletely resected on histopathological examination. Two dogs received toceranibfollowing the surgery. The median follow-up time was 693 days (range, 420-1386days), with a median survival time of 894 days (range, 420-1386 days). Localrecurrence or distant metastases were detected in two of the six dogs (33%) on354 and 398 days following surgery, respectively. The median progression-freesurvival was 492 days (range, 354-1386 days). In conclusion, dogs with localized intrahepatic bile duct carcinoma had a good prognosis following complete surgicalresection.

AB  - An 8 yr old female spayed golden retriever presented for a 3 wk history ofprogressive pelvic limb ataxia. MRI revealed a well-circumscribed T2-weightedhyperintense, T1-weighted poorly contrast-enhancing extradural mass to the right of the spinal cord at the level of L1 causing severe spinal cord compression. Aright-sided hemilaminectomy was performed to remove the mass, and histopathology revealed an intraosseous keratinized cyst. A complete neurologic recovery wasmade within 2 wk following the surgery. This case illustrates a rare diagnosisand the first case report describing MRI findings and favorable clinical outcome after surgical management of a spinal intraosseous keratinized cyst.

AB  - The goal of this study was to determine if anxiety, aggression, and fear-related behaviors are more common in pruritic dogs with atopic dermatitis thannonpruritic, healthy dogs. One hundred forty-one pruritic dogs >1 yr of age with a clinical diagnosis of atopic dermatitis and a >3 mo history of pruritus wererecruited. Dog owners completed a behavioral survey (canine behavioral assessmentand research questionnaire) and a pruritus scale (pruritus visual analog scale). Pruritic, atopic dogs showed significant increases in fear- and anxiety-relatedbehaviors as well as aggression compared with a large control group of healthydogs. Stranger-directed aggression, owner-directed aggression, familiar-dogaggression, dog-directed fear, nonsocial fear, touch sensitivity, excitability,and attention-seeking behaviors were all increased in the study group.Trainability was decreased in the study group. Chronically pruritic dogsexperience fear and anxiety and are more likely to display aggression. This is animportant welfare issue for these animals. Early recognition of the behavioralderangements that can be associated with chronic pruritic skin disease couldallow early intervention with a multidisciplinary approach for these patients,thus improving patient and owner quality of life and long-term treatmentoutcomes.

AB  - A recessed vulva is a conformational abnormality that predisposes affected dogsto urinary tract infections. An episioplasty can be recommended for correction ofthis abnormality when medical management of recurrent urinary tract infectionfails. The objective of this study was to investigate the type and incidence ofurogenital abnormalities visualized by cystoscopy in dogs presenting forepisioplasty. Medical records of 29 dogs that presented for an episioplasty andhad a concurrent or prior cystoscopy were reviewed. Eleven of the 29 dogs hadurogenital abnormalities diagnosed on cystoscopic evaluation, and 1 dog wasdiagnosed with a urogenital abnormality during vaginal examination while undergeneral anesthesia. Ten of the dogs with urogenital abnormalities had acorrective procedure performed, 8 of which were cystoscopically assisted.Cystoscopy provides the ability to directly visualize the urinary tract andobtain samples for biopsy and culture and facilitates correction of some anatomicabnormalities that may predispose the patient to developing recurrent urinarytract infections. Cystoscopy should be considered as a routine part of a thoroughevaluation of the urinary tract in cases presenting for episioplasty.

LID - 10.1007/s10071-022-01648-y [doi]
AB  - Odor generalization is essential for detection dogs. Regardless of itsimportance, limited research is available on detection dog odor generalization.The objectives of this study were (1) evaluate the use of an intermittentschedule of reinforcement to assess generalization in dogs and (2) evaluateolfactory generalization from a single exemplar of smokeless powder (SP). Dogs (N= 5) were trained to detect SP in an automated olfactometer under an intermittentschedule of reinforcement where only 60% of correct responses were reinforced.After training, eight non-reinforced probe trials were inserted within a session.A total of 15 testing odors were evaluated across 15 consecutive sessions (oneodor/session). Six of the testing odors were control and the remaining testingodors were objects indirectly exposed to SP, objects that contained or weredirectly exposed to SP, single-base SP and diphenylamine (the main volatilepresent in the headspace of SP). Dogs' response rate to all testing odors except for the cotton gauzes and t-shirt cloths exposed to the headspace of SP, thesimulated IED, and Getxent tubes exposed to direct contact with SP werestatistically lower than their response rate of actual SP. The response rate toSP was not different across all 15 testing sessions suggesting that theintermittent schedule of reinforcement, maintained dog motivation andperformance. Data show that the outlined method is a good approach to studygeneralization in detection dogs. These results also highlight dog generalizationto SP varieties and associated odors.

TI  - Effect of leukoreduction on inflammation in critically ill dogs receiving redblood cell transfusions: A randomized blinded controlled clinical trial.
PG  - 1248-1257
LID - 10.1111/jvim.16487 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prestorage leukoreduction of red blood cell (RBC) bags preventsaccumulation of pro-inflammatory mediators and experimentally attenuatespost-transfusion inflammation in healthy dogs. However, the effect ofleukoreduction on post-transfusion inflammation in critically ill dogs isunclear. HYPOTHESIS: Dogs transfused with leukoreduced (LR) RBC will have lowerconcentrations of leukocytes, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and C-reactive protein (CRP) within 24 hours ofpost-transfusion compared to dogs transfused with nonleukoreduced (NLR) RBC.ANIMALS: Sixty-one RBC-transfused dogs (LR = 34, NLR = 27). METHODS: Randomized, blinded, controlled preliminary clinical trial. Blood bag processing wasrandomized to create identically appearing LR and NLR bags. Group allocationoccurred with transfusion of the oldest compatible RBC bag. Blood samples werecollected pretransfusion and at 8 and 24 hours post-transfusion for leukocytecount, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and CRP. Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treatbasis using linear mixed effects models. Significance was set at P < .05.RESULTS: No significant differences were found between groups in concentrationsof leukocytes (P = .93), IL-6 (P = .99), IL-8 (P = .75), MCP-1 (P = .69), or CRP (P = .18) over time. Eleven LR dogs (32%) and 4 NLR dogs (15%) were euthanized inthe hospital (P = .14). No natural deaths occurred. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICALIMPORTANCE: No differences in inflammation biomarker concentrations were detectedover time between dogs transfused with LR or NLR RBC, but heterogeneity likelyhampered the ability to detect a difference with this sample size. The novelrandomization and enrollment protocol was successfully implemented across 2participating institutions and will be easily scaled up for a future multicenter clinical trial.

AB  - The parabasalid Pentatrichomonas hominis is generally considered to represent asymbiotic component of the gastrointestinal microbiota in a wide variety ofvertebrate hosts including humans. Nevertheless, a limited number of studies haveraised the possibility that it may act as a pathogen of humans, dogs, and pigsand that some human infections may have a zoonotic origin. Data from NorthAmerica revealed an association between P. hominis and the bovine urogenitaltract, principally in bulls and rarely in cows. The importance of thisobservation is linked to possible interference in the accurate diagnosis of theeconomically important venereal pathogen Tritrichomonas foetus. The current studyemployed culture-based and molecular methods to examine the preputial cavities offour breeding bulls, raised in open pasture in southeastern Brazil, for thepresence of trichomonads. Motile protozoa were isolated from three of the bullsand were definitively identified as P. hominis based on nucleotide sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicons derived from the ribosomal RNA operon(ITS1-5.8S rDNA-ITS2) of the parasite. The potential implications of thesefindings for bovine and human health are discussed.

AB  - In veterinary medicine, measurement of canine C-reactive protein (cCRP) is usedwidely to detect inflammatory diseases. We evaluated the precision of Randox and Fuji assays for cCRP, as well as accuracy, correlation, and agreement compared toa reference ELISA. Blood samples from 71 client-owned dogs (20 healthy, 51diseased) were analyzed with the 3 assays. Inter-assay CVs were ~3.5% with boththe Randox and Fuji assays. The mean biases were -1.90% for the Randox and -5.93%for the Fuji test; the targeted biases were ~8.5% for both assays. The CV, bias, and observed total error were acceptable for the 2 assays compared to ASVCPrecommendations based on biological variation studies. The Spearman correlationcoefficient for cCRP concentration compared with the reference ELISA was 0.83 forthe Randox test and 0.92 for the Fuji test. Both assays measured cCRP preciselyat intermediate and increased concentrations. Correlation with the referenceELISA was good, and both assays could be used to evaluate cCRP concentrations in veterinary practice. However, the assays did not reach analytical agreement;hence the results obtained by these assays are not interchangeable, and serialmonitoring of cCRP requires the use of the same assay.

AB  - The global market for dental implants is constantly evolving. To overcome thelimitations of conventional strategies - invasive surgeries and bone loss around the implant-, new approaches, namely the development of CAD/CAM customizedimplants, are emerging as promising solutions for replacing missing teeth, thusavoiding destruction of bone by drilling it. Despite the efforts that are beingcarried out, the designing, including image acquisition, and manufacturingefficacy of such rehabilitation therapy is not easily found in the literature. Inthis sense, this research work aimed to assess the errors associated with theimage acquisition, treatment and manufacturing of Customized Root-AnalogueImplants (CRAI). The experimental procedure, carried out in a dog cadavericmandible, encompassed the image acquisition and treatment and the subsequentmanufacturing of four different CRAI. Two Image acquisition methods (CBCT andX-ray), and different software for their treatment were used, and the final CRAI were manufactured by Computer Numerical Control. Results revealed the CBCT scanallowed to properly visualize the original teeth contours. However, all theobtained teeth geometries presented smaller surface areas when compared to theoriginal teeth indicating however a systematic predictable error. On the otherhand, when comparing the surface area of the digital and the manufactured teeth, very small differences were observed, which indicates that the CNC manufacturing technique is a promising solution for such applications. When placing theproduced CRAI in the dog mandible it was possible to observe a lack of congruencybetween the CRAI and bone, mainly due to image acquisition process errors and thedestruction of the periodontal ligament during the soft tissues removal process. Thus, CBCT images seem to be a feasible route to design root-analogue implants,and, if needed, a compensation strategy for the systematic image acquisitionerror may be implemented.

Clinical signs in affected dogs most commonly are associated with mechanical obstruction caused by the primary tumor or enlarged regional metastatic lymph nodes and the effects of paraneoplastic hypercalcemia when present. Surgical excision of the primary tumorand metastasectomy of affected locoregional lymph nodes is the preferred initial treatment option for most dogs, although radiation therapy and adjuvantchemotherapy are commonly incorporated into multi-modality treatment plans. Asignificant role for the use of adjuvant chemotherapy has not been clearlydemonstrated. Prolonged survival times are possible, especially for dogs withsmaller primary tumors and for dogs that undergo further treatments for recurrentdisease. In this article, we review the clinical signs, diagnosis, staging,treatment, and prognosis of AGASAC in the dog.

AB  - A novel inhalation exposure system was developed with the aim to increase theefficiency of pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluations of inhaled drugs in a largespecies such as the dog. It enables collecting PK data for multiple drugcandidates in a single experiment by simultaneous administration of the drugs to the same animal. This facilitates a direct PK comparison of the same lung dose ofdifferent drugs using the same blood samples, which can be considered to be arefinement measure from an animal research perspective. The system design wasinspired by a clinical precision dosing dosimeter systems, which enhance dosingprecision by synchronizing the aerosol delivery from the jet nebulizer with theinhalation to maximize the inhaled fraction of the nebulized dose. Theperformance of the novel system was validated in an in-vivo study, which includeda comparison of the same nebulized dose delivered as a fine and a coarse aerosol.The drugs selected for this study were developed for local treatment of the lung via inhalation and were known to have low oral bioavailability due to beingextremely poorly soluble and therefore expected to also have low nasalbioavailability. This would result in systemic exposure derived primarily frompulmonary absorption, which facilitated the PK assessment applied to determinethe lung deposited dose. The jet nebulizer selected to generate a fine aerosolwas designed for alveolar lung deposition and approved by U.S. Food and DrugAdministration for lung ventilation imaging, and the nebulizer selected togenerate a coarse aerosol was a standard nebulizer. The drugs were wet milled to a particle size considerably smaller than the nebulized droplets and thedispersed drug particles were therefore homogenously distributed in the dropletsize distribution. Higher initial plasma concentrations were observed for thefine aerosol. This was expected, as the smaller droplets should deposit moreefficiently in the peripheral regions of the lung, which consequently should leadto a faster absorption compared with the coarse aerosol from the standardnebulizer that should deposit more centrally. The fact that this could beobserved supports that the novel system is an excellent tool in PK evaluations.Our study indicated that there was no difference in the systemic exposure betweenthe fine and the coarse aerosol for the same nebulized dose, and thus the lungdeposition was also the same. The considerable difference in the nebulized sizedistribution within the range relevant for available inhalation devices resulted in a negligible difference in intranasal filtration. The fraction of thenebulized dose that deposited in the lung was observed to be high in this study(mean of 21-30% and about 50% for one dog with a distinguished slow and deepbreathing), which supports that the intranasal filtration was low. That a highfraction of the nebulized dose deposited in the lung indicates that an enhanceddosing precision was obtained with the novel system. The similar achieved lungdoses of all three drugs, shows that the simultaneous administration of multiple drugs worked well. That the intranasal filtration was low is an important findingconsidering that devices for oropharyngeal delivery in dogs are applied in order to eliminate intranasal filtration. Oropharyngeal dosing is more invasivecompared with oronasal dosing and avoiding utilizing that method can beconsidered a refinement measure from an animal research perspective.

TI  - Establishment of a reference interval for urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio in dogs.
LID - 10.1111/vcp.13149 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Albuminuria is an important marker of renal damage and can precedeproteinuria; thus, it can be a useful analyte in the early diagnosis of kidneydiseases. Albuminuria has also been found in dogs with hypertension,inflammatory, infectious, and neoplastic diseases. OBJECTIVES: The aim of thisstudy was to establish a reference interval (RI) for albuminuria in dogs.METHODS: One hundred sixty-four clinically healthy dogs were enrolled in thestudy. Urinary albumin was determined by the immunoturbidimetric method, andalbumin excretion was expressed as the urinary albumin-to-creatinine (UAC) ratio.The RI for UAC was established. RESULTS: After exclusions, 124 dogs from 32breeds remained. The median UAC of the study population was 3.0 mg/g (range:0-48). The RI was defined as 0-19 mg/g (with a 90% CI for the upper limit of13-28 mg/g). No significant difference was found between male and female dogs or between different age and body weight groups. The results of Sighthounds (n = 30)and Beagle dogs (n = 23) did not differ from the other breeds. CONCLUSION: Thecanine RI of UAC is similar but somewhat narrower than the human RI.

TI  - [Outcome of selective mating in the Entlebucher Mountain Dog for reduction ofureteral ectopia].
PG  - 535-546
LID - 10.17236/sat00363 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Entlebucher Mountain Dog is predisposed to ureteral ectopia andassociated diseases of the urinary tract as well as the kidneys, which can havesevere to lethal consequences. Due to the clustered occurrence of clinical signs in 11 % of Entlebucher Mountain dogs in the absence of a genetic test forureteral ectopia, screening was introduced in 2008 to allow phenotype-basedbreeding selection. The ureteral orifices of the dogs are visualized byultrasound and existing urinary retention or urinary incontinence is documented. The diagnostic findings were evaluated centrally with assignment to one of fivephenotypes depending on the localization of the ureteral orifices and the renaland ureteral shape. Breeding approval and mating restrictions are theresponsibility of the respective breeding associations and predominantlyEntlebucher Mountain Dogs with extravesical ectopic ureters and/or clinical signswere excluded from breeding. The effect of phenotype-based selective mating onthe incidence of ureteral ectopia and its clinical signs, as well as possiblefactors influencing the expression of the phenotype, were determined in the birthcohorts after the introduction of screening. Analysis of the data set of 1456phenotyped Entlebucher Mountain Dogs showed, that at 11 % versus 5 %, males were more frequently assigned to the extravesical phenotype than females. The effectof phenotype-based breeding selection was examined in a subpopulation consisting of phenotyped parents and their offspring (n = 876). The prevalence of theextravesical phenotype decreased from 24 % in the 2005 to 2007 birth cohorts to1,4 % in the 2015 to 2017 birth cohorts. Since 2015 almost no EntlebucherMountain Dogs with incontinence, hydroureter or hydronephrosis have beenrecorded. It was feared that the additional selection measures to controlureteral ectopia in the small Entlebucher Mountain Dog population would intensifythe inbreeding increase. However, this has so far remained absent. Therefore, as long as no genetic test is available, it is recommended to continuephenotype-based breeding selection with exclusion of dogs with extravesicalureteral ectopia and/or hydroureter/hydronephrosis/urinary incontinence, whilekeeping an eye on the development of the inbreeding coefficient.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Little is known about the prognostic value of increased urineprotein to creatinine ratios (UPC) comparing different underlying diseases indogs. Therefore, between 2014 and 2015, dogs with a UPC of 2,0 or higher measuredwere retrospectively analysed at least once. They were divided into groups of themost common underlying diseases, namely primary glomerulopathy, Cushing'sdisease, leishmaniasis and in a group of different diseases. Possible prognostic factors, like UPC at time of diagnosis, creatinine, urine specific gravity,albumin and haematocrit, were assessed. Eighty-nine dogs with severe proteinuria were included in the study. Median time of survival was 42 days. UPC and time of survival did not differ significantly between the groups. Among the dogs withprimary glomerulopathy, identified significant risk factors for death includedincreased UPC (p=0,03), increased creatinine (p.

TI  - Effect of an ear cleaner instillation containing lipacids in a model ofre-acidification of the external auditory canal in dogs.
LID - 10.1111/vde.13101 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In humans, the acidic pH of the ear canal plays a protective roleagainst infection and a change towards alkalinity of the external auditory canal (EAC) is a local factor in the progression of acute to chronic otitis externa(OE). The use of acidic preparations alone for treatment of OE without concurrentantibiotic use is well-documented in humans. In dogs, only one study hasinvestigated the EAC pH in healthy dogs and in dogs with OE, and investigationsto understand the role of EAC pH in the pathogenesis of canine OE are lacking.HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To obtain physiological EAC pH values in beagle dogs. Todevelop a model of re-acidification of the EAC in dogs and to investigate how an acidic solution may accelerate the return to a physiological pH. ANIMALS: Tenhealthy beagle dogs in a laboratory setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A model ofre-acidification of the EAC was developed by instillation of a pH 10.1phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution and the subsequent acidic effect of anear cleaner containing lipacids was evaluated in this model. RESULTS: Meanphysiological EAC pH was 6.12 (+/- 0.36). EAC re-acidification took up to 9 h in this model. Mean pH values dropped immediately to 6.38 (+/- 0.27) on ears treatedwith an acidic ear cleaner. No abrupt drop was observed of the mean pH values forthe control ears. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: This study confirms thatphysiological EAC pH in dogs is acidic. This model of re-acidification of the EACpH allows investigations on acidic properties of topical ear products in healthy ears.

LID - 10.1186/s12917-022-03344-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endothelial cell-specific molecule-1 (ESM-1) has emerged as apotential biomarker for cardiovascular disease in humans. Myxomatous mitral valvedisease (MMVD) is the most common heart disease in dogs, and we hypothesized thatMMVD causes chronic inflammation that increases susceptibility to endothelialglycocalyx (eGCX) damage. In this study, we measured the concentration of ESM-1in a group of dogs with MMVD and evaluated factors affecting eGCX damage.RESULTS: Sixty-four dogs (control, n = 6; MMVD, n = 58) were enrolled in thisstudy. There was no significant difference in serum ESM-1 concentrations amongthe MMVD stages. The serum ESM-1 concentration was significantly higher in thedeath group than in the alive group in MMVD dogs. (p = 0.006). In five dogs with MMVD, serum ESM-1 concentrations tended to decrease when the cardiac drug(pimobendan, furosemide, and digoxin) dose was increased. CONCLUSIONS: In caseswhere MMVD progressed to decompensated heart failure with clinical symptoms andresulted in death, the concentration of serum ESM-1 increased significantly.Therefore, ESM-1 could be utilized as a new potential negative prognostic factor in patients with MMVD.

AB  - Surgical excision is currently the recommended treatment for resectable,nonmetastatic mast cell tumours. Recently, Tigilanol tiglate has become availableas a novel intratumoral treatment modality for a subset of cutaneous andsubcutaneous mast cell tumours. In the presented case, we document the successfultreatment of a 0.445 cm(3) subcutaneous digital mast cell tumour in an AmericanStaffordshire Terrier. The resulting wound healed completely and withoutcomplications within 4 weeks and the dog was recurrence-free 8 months aftertreatment. Due to this new intratumoral treatment it was possible to preserve thedigit, while a complete surgical resection of the tumour would have requireddigital amputation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To collect kinetic and kinematic data on the back movement in healthy dogs in comparison to chondrodystrophic dogs following hemilaminectomy whilewalking and trotting. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Gait analysis on the back movementwas obtained from 19 healthy dogs and 21 chondrodystrophic dogs followinghemilaminectomy procedure in consequence to disc herniation in the thoracic orlumbar region. RESULTS: In transverse and sagittal planes the group of surgicallytreated dogs showed a higher range of motion (ROM) throughout the spine whilewalking and trotting. The difference in back movement depended on the region ofthe hemilaminectomy (thoracic, thoracolumbar, or lumbar). Operated dogs showed a significantly higher weight distribution towards their front limbs. Whencomparing the weight distribution among the hind limbs, there was a decreasedPeak Vertical Force (PVF) and Vertical Impulse (VI) on the side corresponding to the hemilaminectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Following hemilaminectomy, dogs displayedincreased instability within their spine, which - depending on the region andside of the hemilaminectomy - affected the back movement in different ways.Weight bearing was generally shifted away from the hind limb of the affectedside, and towards the front limbs. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Even thoughhemilaminectomy has an effect on the back movement of dogs, it seems not to have relevant influence of quality of life.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Canine babesiosis, an infectious disease transmitted by Dermacentorreticulatus, is exhibiting growing importance in Germany. The aim of this studywas to display the increased incidence of canine babesiosis in the Rhine-Mainarea in Hesse, with special focus on the accumulation in the district ofGross-Gerau. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The retrospective study included dogspresented to the veterinary hospital between October 2018 and December 2020 anddiagnosed with canine babesiosis on the basis of a positive Babesia spp.-PCR.RESULTS: A total of 697 dogs were tested by Babesia spp.-PCR during this timeperiod. Of these, 81 (12 %) were positive.Sequencing was performed in 14 of the81 dogs (17 %) (B. canis n = 13, B, vulpes n = 1). A simultaneous anaplasmosisinfection was detected in 2 dogs. Strikingly, babesiosis cases occurredthroughout the year with accumulations in March/April as well as inOctober.Evaluation of a complete blood cell count revealed pancytopenia in 44 of the 81 animals (54 %). Anemia was present in 66 (82 %), thrombocytopenia in 76 ofthe 81 patients (94 %). Only 2 of the 81 positive cases showed no hematologicalchanges. Hyperbilirubinemia was found in 66 of 73 measured bilirubin levels (90%).All animals were treated with two injections of imidocarb-diproprionate(Carbesia((R))) in 14-day intervals. Follow-up PCR was performed in 37 of the 81 patients (46 %). In the majority of cases (92 %), successful therapy wasconfirmed by a negative Babesia-PCR. A total of 6 of the 81 patients (7 %) wereeuthanized during the treatment period. The reasons for euthanasia wereprogressive renal disease, high-grade intravascular hemolysis necessitatingmultiple blood transfusions, and development of splenic and renal abscesses.CONCLUSION: In dogs with clinical signs such as apathy, pyrexia andhemoglobinuria, as well as hematologic abnormalities comprising anemia,thrombocytopenia as well as pancytopenia, babesiosis needs to be included in the list of differential diagnoses. Testing should be initiated accordinglyregardless of the season, however especially in spring and autumn.

TI  - CT measurement of prostate volume using OsiriX((R)) viewer is reliable,repeatable, and not dependent on observer, CT protocol, or contrast enhancementin dogs.
LID - 10.1111/vru.13125 [doi]
AB  - Computed tomography (CT) is an established method for evaluating dogs withsuspected prostatic disease; however, publications assessing the effects ofvarying factors on prostate volume measurements are lacking. The objectives ofthis two-part, observer agreement, methods comparison study were to assessobserver agreement and the effects of varying CT technical parameters for volume measurements of canine prostate glands on CT images using OsiriX((R)) DICOMviewer software. In the first retrospective study, two observers measuredprostate volumes of 13 client-owned dogs thrice on noncontrast and contrast CTimages. In the second prospective study, two observers measured the prostatevolume of 10 cadavers using five different CT protocols and eight cadavers using three slice thicknesses. Observer agreement analyses were performed, andprostatic CT volume measurements were compared with water displacement volumemeasurements. Intra- and interobserver variability and the effect of contrastenhancement were found to be minimal when a one-way analysis of variance modeland intraclass correlation coefficients were used. No significant differencesemerged between different protocols and slice thicknesses using a linear mixedeffects model. When the prostate CT volume was compared using a Bland-Altman plotwith the reference volume acquired by the water displacement method, agreementwithout consistent bias between the methods was shown, and over 90% ofmeasurements were located within the 95% limits of agreement. The findingssupported using OsiriX((R)) software for CT prostatic volume measurements indogs.

TI  - MRI diffusion tensor imaging scalar values in dogs with intervertebral discherniation: A comparison between manual and semiautomated region of interestmethods.

AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures havebeen described as methods for quantifying spinal cord injury and predictingoutcome in dogs with intervertebral disc herniation (IVDH); however, studiescomparing methods for selecting regions of interest (ROIs) are currently lacking.The aims of this retrospective, methods comparison, observational study were tocompare DTI measurements acquired using manual (mROI) versus semiautomated ROI(sROI) methods and to compare DTI measurements with patient outcomes. Magneticresonance imaging scans that included DTI pulse sequences were retrieved for 65dogs with confirmed IVDH. Regions of interest were placed at one vertebral lengthcranial and caudal to the region of spinal cord compression (RSCC) using the mROIand sROI methods. Scalar values based on the mROI and sROI methods were compared.There was a significant difference for all DTI measures (P < 0.0001), wherefractional anisotropy was higher (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.15, 0.19) andmean diffusivity (MD; CI: -0.41, -0.35), axial diffusivity (AD; CI: -0.47, -0.36)and radial diffusivity (RD; CI: -0.36, -0.27) were lower for the mROI than forthe sROI. For both the mROI and sROI, MD, AD, and RD were significantly lower (p < 0.05) at the RSCC in paraplegic dogs that did not regain motor function. Thefindings indicated that DTI methods for quantifying SCI using open sourcesoftware and ROI were feasible for use in dogs with IVDH; however, values basedon sROI methods differed from values based on mROI methods. Some DTI measuresbased on both the mROI and sROI methods were predictive of poor patient outcome.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0270812 [doi]
AB  - Laryngeal paralysis is a well-documented cause of upper respiratory tractobstruction in canines. Diagnosis of laryngeal paralysis is usually made byvisual evaluation of laryngeal motion whilst patients are under a light-plane of anesthesia. However, in human studies of laryngeal function evaluation, it hasbeen shown that subjective scoring can lead to significant interobservervariance, which may cause false diagnosis. In this study, we propose to introducea more objective method of assessing laryngeal function using GlotAnTools andTracker software to directly measure laryngeal motion in anaesthetized patients. Additionally, two anesthetic agents, alfaxalone and propofol, were compared inthis study to assess their relative effect on laryngeal motion and thus theirsuitability for use in this diagnostic process. This study was a two-stage,cross-over, 1:1 randomization, with two active treatment arms. Ten beagles (10-18months, five males and five females) were exposed to both anesthetic agents andlaryngeal motion was recorded using videoendoscopy. GlotAnTools and Trackersoftware were applied to the recorded images to measure glottal gap area (A) and length (L). A normalized measure of laryngeal function-computed as A/L-wascreated, representing the "elongatedness" of the rima glottidis. The glottal gap area was significantly reduced in dogs receiving alfaxalone. This studyobjectively establishes that alfaxalone impacted laryngeal motion significantlymore than propofol and confirms the capability of these computational methods to detect differences in laryngeal motion.

TI  - Allogeneic peripheral blood haematopoietic stem cell transplantation for thetreatment of dogs with high-grade B-cell lymphoma.
LID - 10.1111/vco.12847 [doi]
AB  - Autologous peripheral blood haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) cures 33%-40% of dogs with high-grade B-cell lymphoma. We hypothesized, based on human allogeneic bone marrow transplantation literature, that transplanting dogs using canine donor leukocyte-matched CD34+ cells would lead to fewer relapses andincreased cure rates. We retrospectively reviewed medical records of dogsdiagnosed with high-grade B-cell lymphoma who received an identical allogeneicHCT. A total of 15 dogs transplanted at four facilities were identified. Five of fifteen dogs relapsed before transplant. The mean number of donor CD34+ cells/kg harvested and infused into recipient dogs was 8.0 x 10(6) /kg (range: 2.08 x10(6) /kg-2.9 x 10(7) /kg). The median disease-free interval and overall survivalof all dogs was 1095 days (range: 9-2920 days) and 1115 days (range: 9-2920days), respectively. Two of five dogs, not in remission at transplant, died inthe hospital. The median disease-free interval and overall survival of theremaining three dogs was 25 days (range: 15-250 days) and 1100 days (range:66-1902 days), respectively. The median disease-free interval and overallsurvival of the 10 dogs who had not relapsed was 1235 days (range: 19-2920 days) and 1235 days (range: 19-2920 days), respectively. One dog died soon afterdischarge of presumed gastric-dilatation-volvulus. Eight of nine remaining dogslived >4 yrs post-alloHCT, leading to a cure rate of 89%. Acute graft versus hostdisease was seen in three dogs. These results suggest that allogeneic HCT cancure ~50% more dogs than those treated with autologous HCT.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Aerodigestive diseases (AeroD), hybrid disorders between therespiratory and gastrointestinal (GI) tracts, may present without GI signs.Sliding hiatal hernia (sHH) is an important AeroD in brachycephalic dogs linkedto respiratory pathology. The spectrum of other AeroD and respiratory clinicalsigns (CS) in brachycephalic and nonbrachycephalic dogs with sHH is unknown.OBJECTIVES: Characterize CS of AeroD in dogs with sHH, compare CS betweenbrachycephalic and nonbrachycephalic dogs, and compare thoracic radiographs andvideofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS) for diagnosing sHH. ANIMALS: Sixty-sevenclient-owned dogs with sHH. METHODS: Medical records of dogs with sHH presentedto the veterinary teaching hospitals at Auburn University and the University ofMissouri between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2020 were retrospectivelyreviewed. Between group, comparisons were made using Mann-Whitney test,Chi-square analysis, and Spearman correlation (P < .05). RESULTS: Dogs with sHHpresented with exclusively GI signs (28/67), mixed respiratory and GI signs(22/67), or with exclusively respiratory signs (17/67). Wheras brachycephalicdogs were not significantly more likely to present with respiratory CS (P =.145), they were younger (P < .001), and more likely to present in respiratorydistress (P = .02), and with radiographic evidence of aspiration pneumonia (P <.001) compared to nonbrachycephalic dogs. Six of 12 dogs with normal thoracicradiographs having sHH presented with respiratory CS. For detection of sHH, VFSS was superior to radiographs (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Dogswith sHH may present with exclusively respiratory signs. Respiratory signs may bemore severe in brachycephalic compared to nonbrachycephalic dogs.Videofluoroscopic swallow study was superior to thoracic radiographs fordetection of sHH in dogs.

LID - 10.3758/s13428-022-01907-3 [doi]
AB  - Humans rely on dogs for countless tasks, ranging from companionship to highlyspecialized detection work. In their daily lives, dogs must navigate ahuman-built visual world, yet comparatively little is known about what dogsvisually attend to as they move through their environment. Real-worldeye-tracking, or head-mounted eye-tracking, allows participants to freely movethrough their environment, providing more naturalistic results about visualattention while interacting with objects and agents. In dogs, real-worldeye-tracking has the potential to inform our understanding of cross-speciescognitive abilities as well as working dog training; however, a robust and easilydeployed head-mounted eye-tracking method for dogs has not previously beendeveloped and tested. We present a novel method for real-world eye-tracking indogs, using a simple head-mounted mobile apparatus mounted onto goggles designed for dogs. This new method, adapted from systems that are widely used in humans,allows for eye-tracking during more naturalistic behaviors, namely walking aroundand interacting with real-world stimuli, as well as reduced training time ascompared to traditional stationary eye-tracking methods. We found that whilecompleting a simple forced-choice treat finding task, dogs look primarily to the treat, and we demonstrated the accuracy of this method using alternativegaze-tracking methods. Additionally, eye-tracking revealed more fine-grained timecourse information and individual differences in looking patterns.

TI  - Development and validation of a horse reference panel for genotype imputation.
PG  - 49
LID - 10.1186/s12711-022-00740-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genotype imputation is a cost-effective method to generatesequence-level genotypes for a large number of animals. Its application canimprove the power of genomic studies, provided that the accuracy of imputation issufficiently high. The purpose of this study was to develop an optimal strategyfor genotype imputation from genotyping array data to sequence level in Germanwarmblood horses, and to investigate the effect of different factors on theaccuracy of imputation. Publicly available whole-genome sequence data from 317horses of 46 breeds was used to conduct the analyses. RESULTS: Depending on thesize and composition of the reference panel, the accuracy of imputation frommedium marker density (60K) to sequence level using the software Beagle 5.1ranged from 0.64 to 0.70 for horse chromosome 3. Generally, imputation accuracyincreased as the size of the reference panel increased, but if geneticallydistant individuals were included in the panel, the accuracy dropped. Imputation was most precise when using a reference panel of multiple but related breeds and the software Beagle 5.1, which outperformed the other two tested computerprograms, Impute 5 and Minimac 4. Genome-wide imputation for this scenarioresulted in a mean accuracy of 0.66. Stepwise imputation from 60K to 670K markersand subsequently to sequence level did not improve the accuracy of imputation.However, imputation from higher density (670K) was considerably more accurate(about 0.90) than from medium density. Likewise, imputation in genomic regionswith a low marker coverage resulted in a reduced accuracy of imputation.CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of imputation in horses was influenced by the size and composition of the reference panel, the marker density of the genotyping array,and the imputation software. Genotype imputation can be used to extend thelimited amount of available sequence-level data from horses in order to boost thepower of downstream analyses, such as genome-wide association studies, or thedetection of embryonic lethal variants.

TI  - Sevoflurane Postconditioning Inhibits Pulmonary Apoptosis via PI3K/AKT in DogCardiopulmonary Bypass Model.
PG  - E374-E380
LID - 10.1532/hsf.4721 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The study aimed to investigate the protective effects and regulatorymechanism of sevoflurane postconditioning (SPC) in pulmonary apoptosis induced bycardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). METHODS: Twenty-four healthy dogs were divided intoa control (C group), ischemia/reperfusion (I/R group), sevofluranepostconditioning (S group), and wortmannin group (S+W group). At 10 min after theestablishment of CPB, the left pulmonary artery was blocked. When the pulmonaryartery was reopened, 2% sevoflurane was administered. Wortmannin was delivered 10min before the pulmonary artery was open. Before thoracotomy was implemented(T1), when the artery was reopened (T2) and 2 h after CPB (T3), blood and theinferior lobe of the left lung were isolated and subjected to gas analysis,pathological examination, western blot, and TUNEL staining. RESULTS: No obviouschanges were observed in the C group throughout the experiment. The conditions ofall treated groups progressively deteriorated, and no difference could be foundexcept in the number of apoptotic cells of T3 between the S+W and I/R groups. At T2, the treated groups showed similar conditions. At T3, the lung function andstructure of the S group were improved in I/R and S+W groups. The S group showed the highest p-Akt expression, the lowest cleaved-caspase 3 expression, andapoptotic cell percentage. CONCLUSIONS: Ischemia-reperfusion of the lung duringCPB reduces lung function and injures the pulmonary structure via inducing lungapoptosis. Sevoflurane postconditioning preserves lung function and structure by alleviating apoptosis via activation of PI3K/Akt.

TI  - 3D model of the geometric nest structure, the "mystery circle," constructed bypufferfish.
PG  - 368
LID - 10.1038/s41597-022-01466-4 [doi]
AB  - A small pufferfish, Torquigener albomaculosus, is known to construct an elaborategeometric circular structure, which has been referred to as a "mystery circle,"with a diameter of ~2 m in the sand of the seabed. We reconstructed a 3D model ofthis structure for the first time using a "structure from motion" (SfM)algorithm. The mystery circle constructed by the pufferfish may have potentialapplications for biomimetics similar to the structures constructed by termitesand prairie dogs. To support the significance of its structural characteristics, it was observed that the water passing through the valley upstream always gathersin the center of the structure, regardless of the direction of water flow.Furthermore, it has the function of extracting fine-grained sand particles fromthe valleys and directing these to the center. Computational fluid analysis canbe performed immediately using the quantified 3D data, and the structuralfeatures of the mystery circle is expected to be applied in a wide range offields, such as architecture and engineering, via biomimetics.

AB  - Spay/neuter identification tattoos and ear-tipping are simple and cost-effective methods to minimize the likelihood of unnecessary anesthesia and surgery incompanion animals or the misidentification of sexually intact animals. This studyassessed training of sterilization identifiers in US and Canadian veterinaryschools and practitioner compliance with guidelines for identifiers via surveysconducted in 2019. Faculty in all 34 schools responded to the survey, reportingthat curricula included sterilization identifiers in 31% of lecture-basedtraining, 75% of spay/neuter laboratory-based training, and 38% of clinicalpractice-based training. A total of 425 facilities performing spay/neuterreported frequency and technical aspects of sterilization identifiers inclient-owned and unowned (shelter, rescue, trap-neuter-return) animals.Facilities encountering large numbers of animals of unknown background,performing a high number of surgeries, or with specialized spay/neuter trainingwere significantly more likely to use identifiers. Only 5% of private practicestattooed all owned animals, and 21% tattooed all unowned animals. In contrast,80% of shelters and 72% of spay/neuter clinics tattooed all owned animals, and84% of shelters and 70% of spay/neuter clinics tattooed all unowned animals.Green was the most common tattoo color (97%); the most common placement was near or in the incision for female cats (99%), female dogs (99%), and male dogs (92%),and ventral abdomen in male cats (55%). Enhanced training and implementation ofbest practices described in professional guidelines for sterilization identifiersare needed throughout the veterinary industry to protect animals from unnecessaryprocedures and to prevent unintended litters in animals misidentified aspreviously sterilized.

AB  - Epidemiology and distributions of canine tick-borne diseases as well as theirveterinary and zoonotic significance are poorly understood in Algeria. Thepresent study describes a molecular investigation of important tick-bornepathogens in Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu stricto collected from domestic dogs in steppe and high plateau areas of central and eastern Algeria. In total, 1,043 ticks were collected from 147 dogs, including 756 ticks from 124 dogs in thesteppe region of Djelfa and 287 ticks from 23 dogs in the high plateau area ofBordj Bou Arreridj. Ticks were divided into 384 pools (309 pools from Djelfa and 75 pools from Bordj Bou Arreridj) and tested for genomic materials ofCrimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) as well as DNA for Anaplasmaphagocytophilum, Anaplasma platys, Ehrlichia canis, Rickettsia spp., Babesiaspp., and Hepatozoon spp. using PCR, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis.Hepatozoon spp. was most prevalent, with 160 positive pools (41.7%), and 12 ofthese were sequenced and identified as Hepatozoon canis. Babesia spp. wasdetected in 50 samples (13.0%), of which 11 were sequenced and identified asBabesia vogeli. A. platys and E. canis were detected in 92 (24.0%) and 15 (3.9%) of tested samples, respectively. Rickettsia spp. were detected in 24 (6.3%)samples, including 11 samples identified as R. massiliae, 6 samples identified asR. conorii conorii, and 7 samples could not be identified to species level. All384 pools tested negative for CCHFV and A. phagocytophilum. In addition todetection of R. conorii conorii, R. massiliae, and E. canis, the present studyprovides the first molecular data for occurrence of A. platys, B. vogeli, and H. canis in Rh. sanguineus s.s. infesting dogs in Algeria. Further large scalestudies should be conducted to better understand the epidemiology, distributions,and importance of canine tick-borne pathogens in Algeria.

AB  - Mast cell tumors (MCTs) are an uncommon primary neoplasm of the nasal cavity indogs for which there is a paucity of existing literature regarding their clinicalbehavior and molecular features. The objectives of this retrospective study were to examine the clinical findings, histopathologic and immunohistochemicalfeatures, and c-KIT mutation status of primary intranasal MCTs in dogs andidentify potential prognostic factors. Canine biopsies submitted to a diagnostic laboratory in Colorado between 2010 and 2019 with intranasal neoplasms diagnosed as MCTs and no history of cutaneous or oral MCT were considered.Immunohistochemistry for CD117 and Ki67 and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) forinternal tandem duplications at exons 8 and 11 of the c-KIT gene were performed. Twenty out of 1849 (1%) primary intranasal neoplasms were MCTs. Metastases werereported in 11/20 cases (55%), with the mandibular lymph node representing themost common site. One case had distant metastases to abdominal viscera. Of thecases with available outcome data, 6/14 (43%) died or were euthanized fromMCT-related disease within 1 year of the onset of clinical signs. Only one casehad a c-KIT mutation at exon 11. In our study, intranasal MCTs were prone tometastasize and had a generally poor prognosis, resembling the behavior of MCTsarising in other mucosal locations. While dogs with metastatic disease andsurvival times of <1 year tended to have atypical KIT localization, moderate tohigh Ki67 indices, and mitotic counts >/=8, definitive prognosticators could not be identified due to the limited number of cases with favorable clinicaloutcomes.

TI  - Dissection Techniques and Histological Sampling of the Heart in Large AnimalModels for Cardiovascular Diseases.
LID - 10.3791/63809 [doi]
AB  - The standard gross examination and sampling are key elements in thereproducibility and success of experimental studies of cardiovascular diseasescarried out in large animals. Considering the complex anatomy of the heart,interspecies differences, and the types of compensatory and pathologicalreactions, consistent protocols are challenging to implement. The utilization of multiple dissection protocols is usually adapted to suit the prosector'sexperience, and personal preference continues to be a source of experimental and interobserver variability. Here, the aim is to present the main anatomicalfeatures and landmarks, dissection protocols, and histological sampling standardsof the heart in some commonly used species (including dogs, pigs, ruminants, and cats) as models of cardiovascular diseases. Two standard gross examinationprotocols are presented here. First, the inflow-outflow method, which follows thephysiological blood flow direction through the heart and large vessels(frequently used in dogs, ruminants, and pigs), and second, the four-chamberdissection technique (exemplified in cats). Both techniques can be adapted to anyspecies in certain experimental circumstances. The sampling protocols include allthe areas of interest (sinoatrial node, ventricles, interventricular septum,atria, valves, and aorta), and if properly carried out, improve both thereproducibility and reliability of experimental studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Canine mammary tumours (CMTs) are the most common neoplasm appearing in female dogs and are considered the equivalent animal model of human breastcancer. However, in the literature, there is a gap for ultrasoniccharacterisation of these tumours. In this study, experimental measurements foracoustic attenuation and propagation speed of three surgically excised malignant CMTs were implemented. METHODS: The three tumours were fixed in formaldehyde for up to 72 h and a total of five sample pieces were sectioned from the threetumours to account for the varied morphology observed along the tumours. Thethrough-transmission and pulse-echo techniques were employed for experimentalmeasurements of the acoustic attenuation and propagation speed. RESULTS: Acousticpropagation speed of the five samples as measured at 2.7 MHz was in the range of 1568-1636 m/s. Correspondingly, acoustic attenuation was in the range of1.95-3.45 dB/cm.MHz. Variations in both speed and attenuation were observedbetween samples acquired from the same tumour. CONCLUSIONS: Present findingssuggest that both acoustic attenuation and propagation speed of CMTs are higherthan normal canine tissues due to increased heterogeneity and varied morphologyvisually observed between the tumour specimens and evidenced by histologicalexamination. Nevertheless, experimental results could aid in enhancing the use ofultrasound in the diagnosis and treatment of CMTs as well as provide essentialdata for comparative oncology.

TI  - Agreement between transthoracic echocardiography and esophageal Doppler on aorticflow variables in anesthetized mechanically ventilated dogs.
PG  - 722-726
AB  - The use of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and esophageal Doppler (ED) forthe measurement of hemodynamic variables in anesthetized dogs was studied.Fourteen mixed-breed dogs, without cardiac disease, undergoing general anesthesiafor diagnostic or therapeutic procedures were included in this prospectivepreliminary study. Dogs were premedicated with dexmedetomidine (3 mug/kg) andmethadone (0.3 mg/kg), intramuscularly. General anesthesia was induced withpropofol intravenously titrated to effect and maintained with isoflurane inoxygen. Animals were positioned in dorsal recumbency. Transthoracicechocardiography was performed using a 5-2 MHz cardiac ultrasound probe placed inthe subcostal window, whereas esophageal Doppler was performed using a CardioQprobe (MP50; Deltex Medical, Chichester, UK). Once an appropriate view of theaortic flow was obtained, the variables peak velocity (PV) and velocity-timeintegral (VTI) were measured. Agreement between methods was evaluated using theBland-Altman method with single observation per individual. The bias and thelimits of agreement (LOA) between the two methods were determined. Mean (+/- SD) PV was 99.46 cm/s (+/- 42.73 cm/s) and 110.29 cm/s (+/- 35.86 cm/s), and VTI was 13.24 cm (+/- 4.33 cm) and 13.05 cm (+/- 4.47 cm), for TTE and ED, respectively. Mean differences and LOA were 10.83 cm/s (range: -20.50 to 42.16 cm/s) and -0.19 cm (range: -3.32 to 2.95 cm) for PV and VTI, respectively. No statisticallysignificant differences were determined in the variables measured between TTE andED in anesthetized dogs without cardiac disease, positioned in dorsal recumbency.This could be of clinical relevance when an evaluation of the intraoperativehemodynamic status of anesthetized dogs is desired.

TI  - Closure of a patent ductus arteriosus in a 2-week-old llama cria using an Amplatzcanine duct occluder.
PG  - 706-710
AB  - A two-week-old female llama cria was brought to the UC Davis Large AnimalHospital for evaluation of a cardiac murmur and suspected syncopal episodes. Agrade IV/VI left basilar continuous murmur was present on cardiac auscultation.Echocardiography revealed a left-to-right shunting patent ductus arteriosus(PDA), mild left ventricular enlargement, scant pericardial effusion, and asuspected persistent left cranial vena cava. The PDA was successfully closed withan Amplatz canine duct occluder. Mild mitral regurgitation was present onechocardiography performed 7 d following PDA occlusion. No syncopal episodes wereobserved in hospital prior to or following PDA occlusion. At approximately 1 mofollowing PDA closure, a grade I/VI left apical systolic murmur was present andthe cria's body condition was improved. Key clinical message: Patent ductusarteriosus closure is achievable in New World camelids using interventionalcardiology which provides a minimally invasive treatment option for valuable orcompanion animals. Since interventional cardiac catheterization is commonlyperformed in small animal species, veterinary cardiologists are well-equipped to apply these skills to camelids.

TI  - Counterclockwise gastric dilatation and volvulus in a dog.
PG  - 711-714
AB  - A 6-year-old neutered male golden retriever mix dog was presented forinvestigation of acute restlessness, increased respiratory effort, non-productiveretching, and anorexia. Initial abdominal radiography revealed marked gastricdilation with a normal gastric shape and position, along with mineralizedgranular material in the pyloric region, consistent with a pyloric outflowobstruction secondary to suspected sand impaction. The dog was stabilized withgastric trocharization and medical management with intravenous fluids,antiemetics, polyethylene glycol via a nasogastric tube, and analgesia wasinitiated. The dog developed aspiration pneumonia during hospitalization andbecame oxygen-dependent. There was no significant improvement of clinical status despite 72 h of medical management, and surgical intervention was subsequentlyrecommended. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a counterclockwise gastricdilatation and volvulus. The stomach was repositioned into normal anatomicposition and an incisional gastropexy was performed. The dog was maintained inthe intensive care unit for 4 d postoperatively. Currently, 3 mo postoperatively,the dog is healthy without recurrence of clinical signs. Key clinical message:Counterclockwise gastric dilatation and volvulus is a rare condition inveterinary medicine; however, it should be considered in a patient with acutegastric distension and signs of pyloric outflow obstruction when characteristicradiological signs of clockwise gastric dilatation and volvulus are absent, andthere is radiological evidence of persistent gastric foreign material despitemedical management. Misdiagnosis of counterclockwise gastric dilatation andvolvulus can delay definitive surgical intervention and lead to higher morbidity and mortality.
